1
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,900
 

2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
It's chamomile tea.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,800
It will soothe you.

4
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,340
Don't you have ice water?

5
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,510
You won't burn your mouth. 
Just drink it.

6
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,430
It's unexpected. I can't believe 
you knelt in front of me.

7
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,630
And you have bad knees.

8
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,690
You know now, right?

9
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,340
How much I've given up.

10
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,570
Min Jae.

11
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,470
Let's go home.

12
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,820
You really...

13
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,250
You really don't know me at all.

14
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,350
Just because you knelt, you think

15
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,090
I'd say, "Oh, my!...

16
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,440
how can you...

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,990
how can you do that for me?"

18
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,260
You think I'd be so 
shocked or touched

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,790
that I'd go home with you?

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,030
Then what more...

21
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,200
can I do?

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,190
What do I need to do for 
you to listen to me?

23
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,190
Don't do anything.

24
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,830
No matter what you do,

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,660
I won't change my mind.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,240
Why not?

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,220
Because the expiration date of 
our relationship has expired.

28
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,480
I've given you numerous chances
 extending the expiration date,

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,270
but it didn't work.

30
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,590
You never realized it.

31
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,430
You can leave now.

32
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,590
I'm not finished with the tea.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,800
Hurry up and drink it then.

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,380
Yeah, I'm done now.

35
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,720
It wasn't too bad.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,200
You guys start the party. 
I'll be home soon.

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,410
I'm so proud of everyone.

38
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,350
My beautiful kids.

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,940
My precious kids.

40
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,530
Are they sleeping already?

41
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,820
Ladies and gentlemen...

42
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,900
We're Samgwang Villa's idols.

43
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,900
Oh, yeah. Samgwang.

44
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,550
Hit it.

45
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,840
Let's go!

46
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,070
♫  Congrats, congrats  ♫

47
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,950
♫  Headbutt Bit Chae Woon, 
congratulations!  ♫

48
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,120
♫  My oldest sister 
clearing her name  ♫

49
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,560
♫  Congrats, congrats, 
big congratulations  ♫

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,670
Bit Chae Woon!

51
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,410
♫  Congrats  ♫

52
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,600
♫  Congrats, congrats  ♫

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,530
♫  Congrats for everything  ♫

54
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,540
- What's going on?
- Mom!

55
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,110
- What's going on?
- Welcome home.

56
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,680
We're having a celebration.

57
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,330
My goodness.

58
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,900
Next up is Ms. Soon Jung's 
performance,

59
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,030
who just came home after 
her Southeast Asia tour.

60
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,690
Be quiet. You're making
 too much noise.

61
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,830
We already checked everything.

62
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,230
Noonim, the neighbors next door
 and across the street aren't home.

63
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,050
Noonim, sing a song.

64
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,810
 Sing a song! 

65
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,400
 Sing a song! 

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,880
 Sing a song! 

67
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,560
Okay, too much pressure. 
Before that,

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,380
Bit Chae Woon...

69
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,580
Okay!

70
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,480
I'll sing Red Dragonfly.

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,300
 Okay! 

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,920
Okay, Red Dragonfly.

73
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,260
 

74
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,490
Lee Soon Jung!

75
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,740
Fly. A red dragonfly is flying.

76
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,370
One, two, one, two, three, four.

77
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,870
♫  I guess I'm still young  ♫

78
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,100
♫  I must be  ♫

79
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,370
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫

80
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,680
♫  Why do I miss you 
out of the blue?  ♫

81
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,010
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫

82
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:50,160
♫  Why do I keep waiting for you  ♫

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,310
♫  I guess I'm still young  ♫

84
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,570
♫  I must be  ♫

85
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,640
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫

86
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:07,060
♫  Why do I feel sad 
out of the blue?  ♫

87
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,310
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫

88
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,630
♫  Why do I miss you 
out of the blue?  ♫

89
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,780
 Don't do anything. 

90
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,040
 No matter what you do, 

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,920
 I won't change my mind. 

92
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,320
Jung Hoo, is something wrong?

93
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,660
Why are you dressed like this?

94
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,480
Oh, well...

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,370
I was doing pilates.

96
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,760
Do you know how shocked I was 
getting your phone call?

97
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,040
Why?

98
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,420
Did Noona ask for 
a lot for alimony?

99
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,890
She must've.

100
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,750
How could Noona...

101
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,770
She should consider loyalty
 to you for the past 30 years.

102
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,820
How can she stab you 
in the back like this?

103
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,130
Ah, okay.

104
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,360
I just finished exercising.

105
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,720
My body is very sensitive.

106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,880
Go.

107
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,930
What else did Noona say?

108
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,700
By chance, did she ask
 for some land?

109
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,750
The one down in Cheonan...

110
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,670
Go.

111
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,310
Okay.

112
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,680
Should I call Mr. Lee for you?

113
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,990
They're all the same.

114
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,500
Ra Hoon, these, too.

115
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,340
- Happy?
- Of course. I'm happy.

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,850
You'd better shut your mouth 
about me not passing the audition.

117
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,540
 - You'd better not tell.
- What will you do now? 

118
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,230
 What else? I have to keep working
 and look for another chance. 

119
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,820
 What will you do about that 
Cha Ba Reun or Chuh Ba Reun? 

120
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,610
 What else? She'll give
 up after a while. 

121
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,060
 You know how popular I am. 

122
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Hey, you really aren't 
interested in her?

123
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
She looked all right.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
What do you mean...

125
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,210
Anyway, make yourself clear 
if you're not interested.

126
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,150
Don't turn her into 
another "Misery" woman.

127
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,270
So many girls turned into the 
"Misery" woman because of you.

128
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,160
- You take care of yourself.
- How dare you...

129
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,440
- Do I look foolish to you?
- Stop it.

130
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,330
 That hurts! Mom! 

131
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,930
 Stop that. 

132
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,400
Hae Deun didn't pass her audition?

133
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,270
But why...

134
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,330
Mr. Woo.

135
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,150
Should we grab one 
more drink with this?

136
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,860
Why are you standing
 there like that?

137
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,780
Did you...

138
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,110
Did you find a cockroach in here?

139
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,310
Are there cockroaches 
in this house?

140
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,280
No, no. There aren't.

141
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,630
Why...

142
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,160
Open the door then.

143
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,280
 Gosh, no. You have to find where
 the cockroaches are coming from. 

144
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,650
Trap it and kill it. Hurry up 
and close your window.

145
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,020
Hyungnim, I can tell what 
kind of person you are.

146
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,100
No! I hate cockroaches and
 Lee Man Jung the most...

147
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,060
- Lee Man Jung...
- 20,000 cockroaches?

148
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,520
20,000 cockroaches?

149
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
Open the door! Open!

150
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,820
No, no, I don't know. Whatever!

151
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,460
Uncle!

152
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,040
Geez.

153
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,910
That's so weird.

154
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,180
Why did I blurt out, 
"Lee Mang Jung?"

155
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,900
Geez.

156
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,630
 Stop it, I said! 

157
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,450
 Who was that? 

158
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,330
 Get her! 

159
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,950
I wonder how she's doing.

160
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,890
Hyungnim. A cockroach!
 A cockroach!

161
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,550
A cockroach!

162
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,030
Geez!

163
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,200
 I'm relieved... 

164
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,720
 to know that you're a good 
person as I had expected. 

165
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
A good person.

166
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,810
A good person.

167
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,680
Mom.

168
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,680
Are you that happy 
that you've been cleared?

169
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,180
Yeah. I'm happy.

170
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,730
Mom, what's up?

171
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,800
Just because.

172
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,930
I thought I'd put you to sleep for 
the first time in a long time.

173
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,430
Oh, your gift to congratulate me?

174
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,930
Okay, do it for me.

175
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,300
All right.

176
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,350
Chae Woon.

177
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,840
What did you mean 
on the phone earlier?

178
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,730
You said you'd take it as an 
apology from Jang Seo Ah.

179
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,960
Well, it's kind of like that.

180
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,010
That doesn't make sense.

181
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,220
If the false accusation was cleared,

182
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,010
you should receive 
a proper apology.

183
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,100
Well, you know people like that.

184
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,140
People who will never 
apologize no matter what.

185
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,040
Jang Seo Ah is like that.

186
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,960
But I felt it.

187
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,690
That she felt bad toward me.

188
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,330
So I decided to forgive her.

189
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,270
Well, if that's how you felt.

190
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,710
I guess you can't push 
someone who is

191
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,180
regretful about her 
wrongdoing over the edge.

192
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,520
Anyway...

193
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,510
I'm glad things worked out.

194
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,650
You've been struggling a lot, 
my daughter.

195
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,050
Wow, I know.

196
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,170
But Mom, is something the matter?

197
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,490
Huh?

198
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,960
I mean...

199
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,030
you were singing your
 heart out earlier,

200
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,010
but you seem a bit down.

201
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,990
Well...

202
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,680
Gosh...

203
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,820
My daughter...

204
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,410
You worry when I'm cheerful 
and when I'm down.

205
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,260
That's right.

206
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,710
Because you're the most
 important person to me.

207
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,030
This is nice.

208
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,250
I'm getting sleepy.

209
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,440
 - Hey!
- How did it go? 

210
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,240
 You didn't answer the phone. 

211
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,250
It's okay.

212
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,030
Please go inside, ma'am.

213
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,180
- You do this every morning.
- Oh, no.

214
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,820
I just love walking everyone out.

215
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,500
Mr. Woo, are you uncomfortable?

216
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,650
Gosh, no. I love it.

217
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,420
- I'll get going.
- All right.

218
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,300
Mr. Woo, make lots of
 money today, too.

219
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,760
Yes. I'll make lots of money.

220
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,640
 You'd better shut your mouth 
about me not passing the audition. 

221
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,270
 You'd better not tell. 

222
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,810
- Hae Deun!
- Ahjussi!

223
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,770
What's up?

224
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,140
You never gave me a ride saying
 you're headed the opposite direction.

225
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,180
I'm going in this direction today.

226
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,910
I see. Nice, nice.

227
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,850
Are you feeling good?

228
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,710
Of course. I passed the
 audition and all...

229
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,630
I'm feeling great.

230
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,260
 

231
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,070
Answer it. I won't say a word.

232
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,540
 

233
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,120
 Son, going to work? 

234
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,450
Yeah, Mom.

235
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,080
He says, "mom."

236
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,900
Is someone next to you?

237
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,200
 No. 

238
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,410
Mom...

239
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,040
how do you feel?

240
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,600
I'm good.

241
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,950
Jae Hee, I'm not feeling 
depressed or anything.

242
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,140
Don't worry.

243
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay. How about Father?

244
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,560
 I'm sure your father is well. 

245
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,490
Mom, I'm driving. I'll call you 
when I get to the office.

246
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,340
Okay, drive carefully.

247
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,170
 You said you won't say a word. 

248
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,360
It was funny to hear you say, 
"mom," all of a sudden.

249
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,620
 

250
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,420
That wasn't Seo Ah's voice.

251
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,170
This early in the morning?

252
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,250
Of course, I'd call my mom, "mom."
 Would I call her "dad"?

253
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,100
No, that's not it.

254
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,970
You seem so serious all the time,

255
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,000
but you say "mom" out 
of the blue, Ahjussi.

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,720
Well, it's an unexpected charm.

257
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,470
You're calling me "ahjussi" again.

258
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,640
Since we're at it,

259
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,600
why do you call me "ahjussi" 
and call Na Ro "oppa"?

260
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,930
Of course, I'd call an ahjussi, "ahjussi"

261
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,090
and call oppa, "oppa." What else?

262
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,020
Geez, they're the same.

263
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,960
The sisters are the same.

264
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,400
- Hi, Na Ro oppa.
- I shouldn't have picked her up.

265
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,720
The iron?

266
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Yeah, I have an important 
meeting today.

267
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,890
I want to iron my clothes.

268
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,690
But no one is home.

269
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,190
Uncle Hwak Se is still sleeping.

270
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,560
Where?

271
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,760
Inside the cabinet...

272
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,460
Oh, it's here.

273
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,540
Thank you, Hae Deun.

274
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,350
- Ouch!
- My gosh!

275
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,740
- Hey.
- My foot!

276
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,540
- Your foot!
- My foot.

277
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,870
Na Ro, are you okay?

278
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,340
- My foot.
- Did you break the iron?

279
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,680
Sorry.

280
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,280
This iron is pretty heavy.

281
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,510
Na Ro.

282
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,830
I heard a heavy thud. 
Are you really okay?

283
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,730
Yes, I'm fine.

284
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,170
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

285
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,570
- I'm fine.
- Really?

286
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,760
Wow, he's walking just fine.

287
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,180
He's young. 
He's got strong bones.

288
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,900
But why was he in front 
of Chae Woon's room...

289
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,480
Chae Woon's room is 
only two steps away.

290
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,870
Yup.

291
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,700
Get in.

292
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,160
Thank you.

293
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,530
 The door will close. 

294
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,640
I guess we were telepathic today.

295
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,180
We're matching.

296
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,580
It looks good on you.

297
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
Thank you.

298
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,670
We should finish our conversation.

299
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,090
Let's grab some coffee.

300
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,190
Yes.

301
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,040
How did you know this is my cup?

302
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,240
Is it your cup, CEO?

303
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,060
I just thought it was the prettiest.

304
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,020
I apologized over 
the phone last night.

305
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,370
I should've done it face-to-face.

306
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,060
But it was embarrassing, 
so I did it over the phone.

307
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,860
I was cowardly, huh?

308
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,450
No.

309
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,680
I was so happy.

310
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,520
Huh?

311
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,230
Because you said I'm a good 
person as you had expected.

312
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,400
That made me happy.

313
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,230
Thank you...

314
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,270
for accepting my apology readily.

315
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,860
The time you spent 
feeling injustice

316
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,410
can't be turned back 
nor be compensated.

317
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,430
But I wish that...

318
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,650
we can get along starting now.

319
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,950
Yes.

320
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,490
I'll do my best.

321
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,750
Gosh, seriously. You're no fun.

322
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,820
Why does everyone say, 
"I'll work hard"

323
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,780
"I'll do my best" in front of me?

324
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,450
Because you're the head honcho.

325
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,470
We have to be on your good side.

326
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,040
The head honcho?

327
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,610
The boss?

328
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,530
You're right.

329
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,920
Yes.

330
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,320
Bit Chae Woon, you work hard

331
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,280
and be on my good side.

332
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,510
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,530
We bumped into her 
at the elevator this morning.

334
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,510
She called her in separately.

335
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,990
I asked the CEO.

336
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,610
For her to talk to
 interns separately.

337
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,450
Yes.

338
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,220
 Mom is laughing. 

339
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,200
Seo Ah.

340
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,340
Director.

341
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,700
You seem to be in a good mood.

342
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,390
I met with the CEO.

343
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,970
She encouraged me.

344
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,010
Now that you cleared your name,

345
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,080
you must be thrilled.

346
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,140
I guess we're talking
 as friends right now.

347
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,000
Then I'll speak casually
 for a moment.

348
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,630
Seo Ah.

349
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,800
For me, that incident

350
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,720
wasn't a thrilling event

351
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,780
just because I was cleared.

352
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,500
It shook up my teenage years.

353
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,650
In a way, that incident
 changed my life.

354
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,060
I've made a long detour,

355
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,090
but I lived a diligent life.

356
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,710
I believe that's why 
I can be calm right now.

357
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,650
I know you're not a bad person.

358
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,930
I want to get along well with you.

359
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,090
I'm not sure.

360
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,680
We never really got 
along to begin with.

361
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,900
Don't think about 
getting favors from me.

362
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,280
The full-time position will be 
offered based on performance.

363
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,630
Yes, of course.

364
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,910
I'll do my best, Director.

365
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,790
Director Jang.

366
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,150
I didn't even know you came in.

367
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,860
Huh?

368
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,530
What's going on?

369
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,720
Give me a moment.

370
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,420
I'm your daughter right now.

371
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Is something wrong?

372
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,240
No.

373
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,210
I just want you to baby me.

374
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,140
Gosh, my daughter.

375
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,040
Yes, boss.

376
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Let me sing just one block of time.

377
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,680
Yes. I'm fine with opening time,

378
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,940
or early evening is fine 
with me as well.

379
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,110
Boss.

380
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,600
You know some manias love me.

381
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,870
Yes.

382
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,690
He... hello?

383
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,870
Boss.

384
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,150
Boss?

385
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,950
Geez, I can't believe I'm out of work.

386
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,880
This is all because of that Aunt...

387
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,030
No.

388
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,070
She sacrificed her wide 
footed shoe because of me.

389
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,490
I can't blame her for that.

390
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,170
No.

391
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,380
I'm going crazy.

392
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,440
Gosh, Man Jung.

393
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,660
Don't do that. Come back home.

394
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,330
I'm so worried about you.

395
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,800
Who says I'm sleeping soundly?

396
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,740
Hello?

397
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,350
Man Jung!

398
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,660
- Noonim.
- My goodness.

399
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,820
Is Aunt still rebelling?

400
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,470
Gosh, I'm so upset.

401
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,360
Hwak Se, you know, huh?

402
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,350
What?

403
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,270
Where Man Jung is.

404
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,890
Last time, I heard Man Jung say

405
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,310
you told everyone
 everything or something.

406
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,150
You know, right?

407
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,210
Well...

408
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,220
Long time no see, Dr. Song.

409
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,850
Man Jung, have a seat.

410
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,500
How did you know I worked here?

411
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,320
Well, it's obvious in our field.

412
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,720
How is Jeju Island Hospital?

413
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,170
I'm busy, so I'll get to the point.

414
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,270
Do you still like me?

415
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,310
What?

416
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,710
If you don't, why do you 
keep calling me drunk?

417
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,370
You put me in a bind when you call 
me when I'm with my girlfriend.

418
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,860
Don't drink so much.

419
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,820
I was going to change my number,

420
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,570
but I'm involved all over the
 place. So, I can't change it.

421
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,840
And why do you keep 
calling me a traitor?
 

422
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,630
I mean, wasn't our
 break up mutual?

423
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,050
I never asked you to give
 me your entire asset.

424
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,610
I said I'd take out a loan,

425
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,060
but you gave me everything 
you had voluntarily.

426
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,020
And why now?

427
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,740
That's because I liked you then.

428
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,930
I had no idea you'd betray me.

429
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
Geez...

430
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,330
That betrayal again.

431
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,590
Man Jung.

432
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,900
Did we ever get 
married or something?

433
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,820
A man and a woman can break up
 after dating for a while.

434
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,070
You're the one who 
went all-in foolishly.

435
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,500
If you date this way again,

436
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
any man would get sick 
of you real quick.

437
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,710
Who knew?

438
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,980
Dr. Lee Man Jung, 
who is so particular,

439
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,250
would be so helplessly clingy?

440
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,500
Whoa, you're...

441
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,470
You're really trash.

442
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,850
Trash?

443
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,390
Honey!

444
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,030
I went to the hospital, 
and they said you're here.

445
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,540
I brought you some snacks, Honey.

446
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,080
Man Jung, you...

447
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,040
"Man Jung, you"?

448
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,030
Oh, are you that Dr. Song?

449
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,010
The one who ripped off my honey?

450
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,440
Wait.

451
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,250
I'm glad we met.

452
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,450
We were preparing 
some papers anyway.

453
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,770
What papers?

454
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,360
Paperwork to sue your a**.

455
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,730
What?

456
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,490
My honey voluntarily 
offered up everything?

457
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,450
You asked her to marry you,

458
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,800
so our loyal Dr. Lee Man Jung

459
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,660
gave you everything she had.

460
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,340
You know this is fraud under 
the guise of marriage, right?

461
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,840
So...

462
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,250
you want me to make sure you
 shut your doors in your field?

463
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,230
Should I go for it?

464
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,160
- Honey.
- Excuse me?

465
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,300
Let's go. I'm about to 
have morning sickness.

466
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,450
- Morning sickness...
- Morning sickness?

467
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,390
Man Jung, were you...

468
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,870
two-timing me?

469
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,180
Are you the only one 
who's allowed to two-time?

470
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,240
Hey, do you know why
 I sent you this text?

471
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,280
I did it to make you come
 looking for me like this.

472
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,500
I was messing with you.

473
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,370
Thanks. I got to record you, 
thanks to you.

474
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,770
Hey, Song Han Byul, you just wait.

475
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,140
I'll mail you content
 verification. Got that?

476
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,050
Honey.

477
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,230
- Let's go.
- Yes.

478
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,790
Hey.

479
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,610
Aunt.

480
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,420
Did you really record it?

481
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,920
No.

482
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,010
Did Unni ask you to drop that off?

483
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,240
Yes.

484
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,820
Noonim is very worried about you.

485
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,630
She didn't do anything when I left.

486
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,040
She carries both fire and water.

487
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,270
Tell her thanks.

488
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,850
Aunt.

489
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,380
Seriously. I told you
 I'm not your aunt.

490
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,760
Don't call me aunt. For real!

491
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,300
I know, but I'm used to it. 
What can I do?

492
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,710
Thank you for what you did then.

493
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:38,690
♫  We will now start 
liking each other  ♫

494
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:48,330
♫  When we get our 
 time gone by back  ♫

495
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:58,070
♫  We will now start
 loving each other  ♫

496
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:07,060
♫  So our sweet memories will 
stay beautiful forever  ♫

497
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,820
Cha Ba Reun, she's really 
not following me today.

498
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,520
I'm hungry.

499
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,160
How about some kimbap...

500
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,800
♫  Congrats, congrats  ♫

501
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,690
I wonder if Hae Deun is doing okay.

502
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,450
Whoa, I can't believe 
they send me back down

503
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,800
to the office just 
because I got eliminated.

504
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,290
Two Americanos.

505
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,550
Put two ice cubes in one,

506
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,160
one latte and one cafe mocha. 
One pump of whip cream.

507
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,050
Three ice vanilla lattes, 
two grapefruit-ade,

508
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,040
one lemonade, 
one green tea smoothie,

509
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,970
two yogurt smoothies, 
one apple cinnamon tea,

510
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,870
and one tomato juice, no syrup.

511
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:09,140
Lee Hae Deun, you're so 
pretty as always.

512
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,740
That, that girl...

513
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,330
Hey, you...

514
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,840
How did you know I was here?

515
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,650
Via various ways.

516
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,310
I wanted to know what 
kind of person you are.

517
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,640
You're really something.

518
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,860
Your drinks are ready.

519
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,210
Okay.

520
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,390
- I'm fine.
- You don't look it.

521
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,510
Hey!

522
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,760
Hey, you.

523
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,450
- Lee Ra Hoon.
- Hey!

524
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,730
Lee Ra Hoon.

525
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,680
- What are you doing here?
- Noona...

526
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,490
To see you.

527
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,320
No wonder I didn't see you.

528
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,230
You came here this morning?

529
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,480
I wanted to settle 
a score with this unni.

530
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,130
No matter how I think about it,

531
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't think she likes 
you that much.

532
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,710
So I wanted to get 
a definite answer.

533
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,730
Hey.

534
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,350
How do you know
 I'm older than you?

535
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,250
You can tell right away.

536
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,570
What do you mean? 
She likes me a lot.

537
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,190
Right? Yeah.

538
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,360
And you're too much. How can 
you come all the way here?

539
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,460
I told you what kind of person I am.

540
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,280
Yeah. You did.

541
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,140
- You don't attend...
- Hey!

542
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,120
- Let's talk.
- Talk about what?

543
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,580
- Can I drink one?
- What?

544
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,990
Drink what?

545
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,370
Hey, hey, hey.

546
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,080
You guys go play elsewhere.

547
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,260
Lee Hae Deun.

548
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,580
I'm working right now.

549
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,570
That's right, Chuh Ba Reun.
 You're right.

550
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,540
He and I are nothing.

551
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,700
Good luck to you two.

552
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,600
Don't come looking for me.

553
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,200
I'm off.

554
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,660
Noona, why? You said 
you'd help me out.

555
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,330
What? You two look 
good together.

556
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,780
Both elite university students.

557
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,870
Stop playing hard to get. 
Good luck.

558
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,570
She seems all right. 
She's tough, too. I'm off.

559
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,030
Hey, Lee Hae Deun!

560
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,510
Noona!

561
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,760
I knew this would happen.

562
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,250
You put on a show!

563
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,850
Lee Hae Deun must 
be upset right now.

564
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,020
You didn't have lunch yet, right? 
Let's go eat.

565
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,430
Cha Ba Reun.

566
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,270
I don't have an easy life or have
 time to kill like you, Cha Ba Reun.

567
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,010
Well, I'm not in a position 
to have a girlfriend, either.

568
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,910
I'm really sorry to reject 
someone so attractive as you.

569
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,520
But from now on,

570
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,150
don't come looking for us.

571
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,610
Lee Hae Deun nor me.

572
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,930
All right then.

573
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,360
Hey! Who do you think you are?

574
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,670
How dare you judge 
me so quickly?

575
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,290
Do I look like I have an easy life?

576
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,950
Do I look like I have time to kill?

577
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,940
That's not true. I put my ego aside.

578
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,050
My pride hurts a lot.

579
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,940
But I know you like me, too.

580
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,340
I came onto you because you 
couldn't muster up the courage.

581
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,670
Well, I thought...

582
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,060
Who cares if you're not 
a university student?

583
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,960
How dare you judge me like that?

584
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,660
Who do you think you are?

585
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,790
Wait.

586
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,610
Wait, Cha...

587
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,240
Really?

588
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,540
Father wants a divorce, too?

589
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,040
Yeah.

590
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,640
Jung Hoo hired a team of 
amazing divorce lawyers.

591
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,200
He hates to spend even a dollar.

592
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,220
He's bold when it comes to this.

593
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,920
It's so weird.

594
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,250
 

595
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,940
What's going on?

596
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,040
Is that how you say "hello"
 these days?

597
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,450
Jung Hoo? I'm not here.

598
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,170
I couldn't believe you called me
 when you blocked my number.

599
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,290
Did your mom...

600
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,580
say something to you?

601
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,260
Any changes?

602
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,270
There are no changes.

603
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,860
How about you, Father?

604
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,280
Same here.

605
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,260
An eye for an eye,
 a lawsuit for a lawsuit.

606
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,631
Tell her I'll keep moving forward.

607
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,728
The abandonment of inheritance
 rights I wrote last time.

608
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,638
When should I notarize that?

609
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,068
Notarize?

610
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:53,858
You should, of course.

611
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:56,578
Set a date with Mr. Suk!

612
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:59,588
All right then. I'll find a lawyer...

613
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:02,998
Geez.

614
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:04,448
What did Jung Hoo say?

615
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,358
It's no joke, huh?
 He's furious, huh?

616
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:12,508
They're all in it together.

617
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:15,578
I even knelt.

618
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:17,798
I even knelt!

619
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:46,148
It doesn't make sense that 
you haven't found a clue yet.

620
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:47,548
 
 I'm sorry. 

621
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:52,138
You're continually checking the CCTVs
 in my neighborhood, right?

622
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:53,218
 Yes. 

623
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:55,218
 We haven't found 
anything unusual yet. 

624
00:38:56,398 --> 00:38:58,078
Geez.

625
00:38:58,078 --> 00:38:59,618
Then...

626
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:03,928
why don't you obtain CCTVs around
 my company in the last month

627
00:39:03,928 --> 00:39:06,288
and look through them carefully?

628
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:09,378
I'm sure you'll find 
someone suspicious.

629
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:15,288
I hired you because it's 
a tough job, you know?

630
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:18,748
I hope you find 
something this time.

631
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,868
Jang Seo Ah...

632
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:04,068
You're strangely entangled 
with Lee Bit Chae Woon.

633
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:12,628
Hwang Na Ro.

634
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:14,188
This is Director Jang Seo Ah.

635
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:15,568
I'm Hwang Na Ro.

636
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,738
Nice to meet you.

637
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,488
You'll be translating for 
our new project?

638
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:22,668
Yes, thank you in advance.

639
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:52,978
 Let's go. 

640
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:54,968
 - Mom.
- You're hurting me. 

641
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,228
Gosh.

642
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:03,358
 

643
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,618
Yes.

644
00:41:14,748 --> 00:41:16,268
Soon Jung?

645
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:20,288
Ms. Jung Won, how have you been?

646
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:24,308
I meant to call you back last 
time, but I totally forgot.

647
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:25,438
Sorry.

648
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:28,048
No worries. It's okay.

649
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:29,948
Soon Jung, let's meet.

650
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:32,338
Are you free tonight?

651
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:35,218
Well, tonight is...

652
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:38,098
Let's meet tonight. Please?

653
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:41,348
I want to see you, Soon Jung.

654
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:44,738
 I'll send over my car 
to your house. 

655
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:46,478
I went there last time.

656
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:48,458
Wait, no.

657
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,448
I'll go.

658
00:41:50,448 --> 00:41:52,448
Where should I go, 
Ms. Jung Won?

659
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:53,658
All right.

660
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:55,558
Then where should we meet...

661
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:09,578
Is something wrong?

662
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,578
Gosh, at work...

663
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:15,668
there's a cute employee.

664
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:17,398
 Soon Jung, hold on. 

665
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:20,208
Be careful, be careful, be careful!

666
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:31,278
Soon Jung, where 
should we meet?

667
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:36,888
Drink lots of water and rest.

668
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,958
- Resting is best.
- Thank you.

669
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:40,738
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

670
00:42:40,738 --> 00:42:41,868
Let's go.

671
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:06,028
What...

672
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:09,058
He might think I went 
there to see him.

673
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:11,188
How did he know it was me?

674
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:20,738
Soon Jung!

675
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,598
Ms. Jung Won.

676
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:25,168
Did you wait long?

677
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:26,628
No.

678
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:33,058
People might think 
we're high school friends.

679
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:36,758
I guess we're closer than
 high school friends.

680
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:41,268
So what does your
 husband do for a living?

681
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:44,558
Is he retired by now?

682
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:46,998
No.

683
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:48,848
My kids' father...

684
00:43:48,848 --> 00:43:52,458
passed away a long time ago.

685
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,518
I see.

686
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:58,818
My kids' father died 
early on as well.

687
00:44:00,378 --> 00:44:02,678
How...

688
00:44:06,398 --> 00:44:09,058
You must've struggled 
a lot all this time.

689
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:11,898
You, too, Ms. Jung Won.

690
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:13,208
Gosh.

691
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,788
I told you not to address me, 
"Ms. Jung Won."

692
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:17,588
Just call me by my name.

693
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,318
Say, "Jung Won."

694
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:21,268
We're the same age.

695
00:44:21,268 --> 00:44:22,458
Gosh...

696
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,108
how can I...

697
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:25,898
It's a habit.

698
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:31,218
Then since my birthday is faster,

699
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:32,478
how about "unni"?

700
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,208
That's good. Unni.

701
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:36,208
Try calling me "unni," Soon Jung.

702
00:44:38,578 --> 00:44:41,418
This is no good, Soon Jung.

703
00:44:42,198 --> 00:44:45,198
You won't listen to me now 
that we're both adults?

704
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:47,548
Try it.

705
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:50,128
Say, "unni."

706
00:44:50,128 --> 00:44:53,008
Gosh, come on.

707
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:58,758
Yes, Mr. Yu.

708
00:44:58,758 --> 00:44:59,978
I'm almost there.

709
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:01,288
Yes.

710
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:03,318
Mr. Koala.

711
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:05,338
Headbutt, what brings you here?

712
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:07,148
To go home together?

713
00:45:07,148 --> 00:45:09,878
That's too bad. I didn't 
bring my car today.

714
00:45:09,878 --> 00:45:12,258
You ask and answer everything.

715
00:45:12,258 --> 00:45:15,578
I'm here to get paid for the
 job I did with the tiles.

716
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:18,158
Oh, you're here for that.

717
00:45:18,158 --> 00:45:19,878
Excuse me.

718
00:45:19,878 --> 00:45:21,358
Yeah.

719
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:24,328
Here?

720
00:45:24,328 --> 00:45:25,638
 Did I surprise you? 

721
00:45:25,638 --> 00:45:28,008
Oppa, you owe me dinner.

722
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:29,458
I'm off.

723
00:45:30,538 --> 00:45:32,358
Yeah, so...

724
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:34,198
Koala!

725
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,768
I'm out right now.

726
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,158
What are you doing?

727
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:42,348
Oh, really?

728
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:45,408
Yeah, you go ahead. 
I'll be right there.

729
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:46,538
Okay.

730
00:45:55,768 --> 00:45:57,358
What are you doing?

731
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,208
Avoiding your girlfriend?

732
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,598
Geez.

733
00:46:01,988 --> 00:46:03,158
She's not my girlfriend.

734
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:05,038
I have a reason. 
Just for a second.

735
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:25,918
My goodness.

736
00:46:29,398 --> 00:46:30,568
Sorry.

737
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,228
I don't know what
 your reasons are,

738
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:34,858
but you shouldn't do this.

739
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,498
If you want to break up, break up. 
Or settle your issues.

740
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:39,108
Face it head-on.

741
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:41,328
She's not my girlfriend.

742
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:43,788
- Then why hide?
- Well...

743
00:46:43,788 --> 00:46:45,698
 Because I know your 
relationship to her. 

744
00:46:45,698 --> 00:46:47,798
You shouldn't lie like that.

745
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:49,998
If she's not your girlfriend, 
why would she come to your office?

746
00:46:49,998 --> 00:46:51,928
She's my friend's sister.

747
00:46:51,928 --> 00:46:53,008
Joon Ah.

748
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:55,868
My best friend's sister.

749
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:57,258
But...

750
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:00,448
Bit Chae Woon.

751
00:47:00,448 --> 00:47:02,208
Why are you so sensitive?

752
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:07,138
Are you uneasy thinking 
I might have a girlfriend?

753
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:08,808
What?

754
00:47:08,808 --> 00:47:11,708
Now that I think about it, 
you were like this last time, too.

755
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,678
What's this? How should 
I interpret this?

756
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:19,208
Are you jealous subconsciously?

757
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:21,378
You don't want to admit it, 
but strangely...

758
00:47:21,378 --> 00:47:22,428
Geez!

759
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:28,378
Under the pretense 
of chastisement,

760
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,008
you touched my face boldly.

761
00:47:30,008 --> 00:47:31,878
Geez, that's not it.

762
00:47:31,878 --> 00:47:34,768
When I get angry, 
I do this to my siblings.

763
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,458
Whatever.

764
00:47:39,408 --> 00:47:41,088
What do you mean?

765
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:42,588
You do know.

766
00:47:43,418 --> 00:47:44,978
Is it jealousy?

767
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:50,988
Ms. Lee, I have your estimate.

768
00:47:50,988 --> 00:47:52,928
Would you look at it?

769
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:54,518
If you look here,

770
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:57,138
- you laid 200 tiles.
 - Why are you so sensitive? 

771
00:47:57,138 --> 00:47:59,398
 Are you uneasy thinking
 I might have a girlfriend? 

772
00:47:59,398 --> 00:48:01,068
 What's this? How should
 I interpret this? 

773
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:02,558
 Are you jealous subconsciously? 

774
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:04,478
 You don't want to admit it, 
but strangely... 

775
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:05,538
Darn it!

776
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,578
What?

777
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:10,968
What? Is something off?

778
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:15,288
No, no.

779
00:48:17,368 --> 00:48:21,298
I noticed on my way in that
 Mr. Woo's girlfriend was here.

780
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,128
Yeah, she comes by often.

781
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:25,408
I think she likes him more.

782
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:27,658
Geez, lucky bastard.

783
00:48:29,778 --> 00:48:31,878
And how dare he...

784
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:37,008
What?

785
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:43,178
- Should we look at this?
- Ah, yes.

786
00:48:43,228 --> 00:48:45,178
Yes, 200 tiles...

787
00:48:48,078 --> 00:48:49,778
Soon Jung.

788
00:48:49,778 --> 00:48:52,388
A long time ago, on Christmas day,

789
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:56,508
do you remember making french 
toasts at Min Jae's house?

790
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,918
Of course, I remember.

791
00:48:59,918 --> 00:49:01,568
Sounds fun, huh?

792
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:05,338
- Hurry!
- Sounds so good.

793
00:49:06,768 --> 00:49:09,258
- I'm so hungry.
- This is so fun.

794
00:49:21,118 --> 00:49:22,618
Really.

795
00:49:23,768 --> 00:49:25,538
Girls, have some snacks...

796
00:49:25,538 --> 00:49:28,678
Wait. Why is this in here?

797
00:49:28,678 --> 00:49:30,468
Soon Jung!

798
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,398
 For toasting bread in the room
 on a kerosene stove, 

799
00:49:33,398 --> 00:49:34,908
 Min Jae's mom scolded us. 

800
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:38,968
 Ahjumma got so angry
 saying we'll start a fire. 

801
00:49:38,968 --> 00:49:41,278
When I think about that time,

802
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,888
I feel so bad toward you, 
Soon Jung.

803
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:47,368
You said no, but Min Jae 
and I insisted.

804
00:49:47,368 --> 00:49:49,808
You got in so much 
trouble for that.

805
00:49:49,808 --> 00:49:52,918
I was a hired help.

806
00:49:52,918 --> 00:49:54,718
Ms. Jung Won.

807
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:59,748
You said you don't stay in 
touch with Ms. Min Jae, right?

808
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,858
Yeah.

809
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:06,688
 

810
00:50:11,328 --> 00:50:12,408
 

811
00:50:14,938 --> 00:50:16,788
 Of all days, why now? 

812
00:50:17,638 --> 00:50:19,208
Excuse me for a moment.

813
00:50:21,988 --> 00:50:23,378
Yes?

814
00:50:23,378 --> 00:50:25,228
Are you in a meeting?

815
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:26,908
No.

816
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:30,338
I'm meeting an old friend of mine.

817
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,948
What other old friend 
do you have beside me?

818
00:50:34,818 --> 00:50:36,678
By chance, Soon Jung?

819
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,218
Yeah.

820
00:50:39,218 --> 00:50:40,668
Oh, my gosh.

821
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:41,738
All right.

822
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,608
Hey, don't talk about me.

823
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:44,998
Okay. I'll talk to you again.

824
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:46,778
 Wait, wait, Jung Won! 

825
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:49,268
Is Soon Jung...

826
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:52,908
still beautiful?

827
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,988
Yeah.

828
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,328
Yup.

829
00:51:01,368 --> 00:51:04,098
Have fun.

830
00:51:06,978 --> 00:51:09,368
Gosh, I have to lose weight.

831
00:51:10,738 --> 00:51:12,518
Gosh, that girl.

832
00:51:12,518 --> 00:51:15,058
My friend from college.

833
00:51:15,058 --> 00:51:16,618
I see.

834
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:18,948
Eat more.

835
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:21,788
- This is so good.
- Yes, eat more.

836
00:51:24,398 --> 00:51:25,868
Look at me.

837
00:51:25,868 --> 00:51:29,528
Why am I curious to know if 
Lee Soon Jung is still beautiful?

838
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:43,998
To be a good writer, 
you have to know Korean well.

839
00:51:43,998 --> 00:51:45,708
So I got this for you.

840
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:48,878
No thank you.

841
00:51:50,058 --> 00:51:51,458
It's a gift.

842
00:52:10,478 --> 00:52:11,978
Geez!

843
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:14,858
That still makes me mad.

844
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:16,688
- What?
- Scared me!

845
00:52:18,528 --> 00:52:20,488
Did you follow me?

846
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:21,848
Yeah.

847
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:27,438
Min Jae, let's talk for a moment.

848
00:52:27,438 --> 00:52:30,248
Aren't we done talking?

849
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:32,248
I'm not done.

850
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:35,348
Let's go in here and talk.

851
00:52:35,348 --> 00:52:38,048
No, I have an appointment here.
 I have to go in.

852
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:39,438
What appointment?

853
00:52:40,128 --> 00:52:41,928
Meeting your lawyer again?

854
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:43,508
No, it's for my business.

855
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:45,128
Business?

856
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,068
What kind of swindler 
are you meeting?

857
00:52:47,068 --> 00:52:48,888
- Let's go together.
- Wait.

858
00:52:48,888 --> 00:52:50,868
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo.

859
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:53,848
Let's not do this. 
Let's part ways nicely.

860
00:52:53,848 --> 00:52:54,978
I beg you.

861
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:56,768
I said, I'm sorry.

862
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:58,048
I knelt.

863
00:52:58,078 --> 00:53:01,438
- What more do I need to do?
- Are you really sorry?

864
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:04,018
- Truthfully?
- Yeah.

865
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:08,488
Then, grant my wish.

866
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:10,218
Let's get divorced.

867
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:12,278
Let's not go to court.

868
00:53:12,278 --> 00:53:14,308
Be careful going home.

869
00:53:15,608 --> 00:53:16,998
Min Jae.

870
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,858
I'm sorry for being late.

871
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:24,098
- Hello.
- Hello.

872
00:53:24,098 --> 00:53:25,138
Nice to meet you.

873
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:27,948
- Did you wait long?
- I just got here.

874
00:53:27,948 --> 00:53:30,318
- I see.
- Did you have lunch?

875
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:52,458
 I don't know what your reasons are, 

876
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,198
 but you shouldn't do this. 

877
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,558
 If you want to break up, break up. 
Or settle your issues. 

878
00:53:56,558 --> 00:53:58,218
 Face it head-on. 

879
00:53:58,218 --> 00:53:59,368
Oppa.

880
00:53:59,368 --> 00:54:00,578
What?

881
00:54:00,578 --> 00:54:02,348
Is something the matter?

882
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:04,108
No, it's nothing.

883
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:06,798
Hey, eat more of this meat.

884
00:54:10,728 --> 00:54:11,958
Excuse me.

885
00:54:14,678 --> 00:54:16,628
Hi, Ms. Yoon.

886
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,218
I see.

887
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,598
Okay, take care of it that way.

888
00:54:21,598 --> 00:54:22,818
Thank you.

889
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:26,468
Hey, is this your baby picture?

890
00:54:26,468 --> 00:54:28,248
Gosh, it's cute.

891
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:29,818
Wait.

892
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:33,348
You look different now. 
Were you cuter then?

893
00:54:33,348 --> 00:54:36,218
Everyone is cuter 
when you're a baby.

894
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,198
Why?

895
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:44,408
I think I saw this somewhere.

896
00:54:44,408 --> 00:54:46,248
Where did I see it?

897
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:58,498
Hae Deun.

898
00:54:58,498 --> 00:54:59,808
Hi, Unni.

899
00:54:59,808 --> 00:55:01,328
What?

900
00:55:01,328 --> 00:55:03,408
Why are you so down tonight?

901
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:05,678
- Tough practice?
- Huh?

902
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:08,178
Yeah, yeah.

903
00:55:08,188 --> 00:55:09,848
This won't do.

904
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,488
I'll have to buy you 
something nutritious.

905
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:15,728
I can't. I have to go on a diet.

906
00:55:15,728 --> 00:55:18,978
I see. You're working harder 
since you passed your audition.

907
00:55:18,978 --> 00:55:20,098
- Yeah.
- Aigoo.

908
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:21,928
Oh, no. You love to eat.

909
00:55:21,928 --> 00:55:23,318
Ladies!

910
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:25,338
- Going home?
- Uncle.

911
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:27,158
I started working here today.

912
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:29,568
- It's a part-time job.
- That's great.

913
00:55:29,568 --> 00:55:31,088
You were worried you 
were out of work.

914
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:33,518
- I'm so glad, Uncle.
- Bit Chae Woon, Hae Deun.

915
00:55:33,518 --> 00:55:34,768
Na Ro.

916
00:55:39,928 --> 00:55:41,588
Drinking alone, Na Ro?

917
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,428
I was celebrating.

918
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:44,468
Celebrating?

919
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:46,128
Today, I...

920
00:55:46,128 --> 00:55:47,998
got a job.

921
00:55:47,998 --> 00:55:50,138
Whoa, congrats.

922
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,018
Of course. Samgwang Villa
 is a lucky place.

923
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:54,988
There's something more shocking.

924
00:55:54,988 --> 00:55:55,738
What?

925
00:55:55,738 --> 00:55:58,498
Na Ro got hired by your company.

926
00:55:58,498 --> 00:56:00,318
The contract position for 
that Spanish project.

927
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:02,138
Oh, that? You should've told me.

928
00:56:02,138 --> 00:56:03,918
And what if I don't get the job?

929
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:06,368
So what? Who cares about that?

930
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:08,198
Anyway, congratulations, Na Ro.

931
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,498
I'm so happy for you.

932
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:10,678
Thank you.

933
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:12,888
Ahjussi!

934
00:56:12,888 --> 00:56:14,958
Geez, I said I'm not ahjussi.

935
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,018
Na Ro oppa got a job 
at Unni's workplace.

936
00:56:17,018 --> 00:56:18,378
Oh, really?

937
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:19,848
Did you introduce him?

938
00:56:19,848 --> 00:56:21,558
 No. 

939
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,878
Are you two in a choir?

940
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:26,898
Na Ro, congratulations.

941
00:56:26,898 --> 00:56:28,118
Thank you.

942
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,828
Wow, you see each other 
at work and home.

943
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:33,378
- You're truly one family.
- Right?

944
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:36,658
Could something happen
 between you two?

945
00:56:36,658 --> 00:56:38,668
It could.

946
00:56:38,668 --> 00:56:40,608
Perhaps.

947
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:42,378
Perhaps?

948
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:47,718
Did you have a nice date?

949
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:49,838
I said it wasn't a date.

950
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:52,338
Hyungnim, you're 
wearing an apron.

951
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:53,958
- He's working part-time.
- My part-time job.

952
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:56,698
I see. Take care, Hyungnim.

953
00:56:56,698 --> 00:56:58,288
Enjoy...

954
00:57:00,488 --> 00:57:03,718
Mr. Woo seems quite edgy today.

955
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:06,478
He seems to have his reasons.

956
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:07,828
What reason?

957
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:12,298
Everyone, eat.

958
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:13,788
Eat.

959
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:17,948
Really?

960
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:20,018
Mr. Woo's mother...

961
00:57:20,018 --> 00:57:23,468
said, "I'm sure your 
father is fine."

962
00:57:23,468 --> 00:57:26,268
I think they live separately.

963
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:29,758
 He said his mother left home. 

964
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:33,458
He looked a bit downcast.

965
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:34,878
Hey, Lee Hae Deun.

966
00:57:34,878 --> 00:57:37,568
What TMI are you
 spilling like that?

967
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:39,528
None of your business.

968
00:57:39,528 --> 00:57:41,188
- What?
- Go wash your feet.

969
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:43,188
My feet? I told you not 
to talk about my feet.

970
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:44,528
- My feet...
- Go!

971
00:57:48,418 --> 00:57:51,848
 Could something happen 
between you two? 

972
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:53,688
 It could. 

973
00:57:54,628 --> 00:57:56,208
 Perhaps. 

974
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:57,928
 Perhaps? 

975
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,088
Such a friendly atmosphere.

976
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:10,218
Ride with me.

977
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:13,838
No, I'll get home in
 no time on a bus.

978
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:16,458
I've been to your 
neighborhood before.

979
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,678
It's not that close from here.

980
00:58:18,678 --> 00:58:21,328
My driver will be here soon.

981
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:23,978
Well...

982
00:58:24,048 --> 00:58:25,878
as for that...

983
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,508
At the time...

984
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:30,578
that wasn't my neighborhood.

985
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:32,618
It's not where my house is.

986
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:34,288
I'm sorry.

987
00:58:34,288 --> 00:58:35,818
Oh, my.

988
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:39,568
You're embarrassed to 
show me where you live?

989
00:58:39,568 --> 00:58:41,878
Gosh, it's not like that.

990
00:58:41,878 --> 00:58:45,418
Gosh, who cares 
between you and me?

991
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:47,138
My car is coming.

992
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:51,118
Okay.

993
00:58:51,118 --> 00:58:53,598
Take the bus and get home safely.

994
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:55,818
Be at peace.

995
00:58:55,818 --> 00:58:56,988
Okay.

996
00:58:56,988 --> 00:58:58,858
Be careful going home.

997
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:01,908
I'll be going, Soon Jung.

998
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:49,328
 Jung Hoo, Noona has a SNS page. 

999
00:59:49,328 --> 00:59:51,188
 Here's the link. 

1000
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:55,098
This guy is thrilled. So thrilled.

1001
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:12,498
 

1002
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:21,128
 #I'll live alone. 

1003
01:00:21,128 --> 01:00:23,848
 #Goodbye, my gloomy past. 

1004
01:00:23,848 --> 01:00:26,868
 #Min Jae, hooray to 
your independence. 

1005
01:00:27,678 --> 01:00:29,378
When this, Woo Jung Hoo, is...

1006
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:33,988
living in this gloom and
 doom so pathetically.

1007
01:00:33,988 --> 01:00:36,458
You're so happy-go-lucky, huh?

1008
01:00:39,938 --> 01:00:42,718
How you must've hated 
being married...

1009
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:47,188
How tired you must've 
been of me...

1010
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:01,668
Fine.

1011
01:01:01,668 --> 01:01:05,598
Do you think I'd cling 
to you forever?

1012
01:01:05,598 --> 01:01:07,508
Give me a break.

1013
01:01:12,678 --> 01:01:14,358
 

1014
01:01:18,618 --> 01:01:22,068
 

1015
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:28,728
What now?

1016
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:30,918
I'll do as you say.

1017
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:32,258
What?

1018
01:01:32,258 --> 01:01:33,768
 Let's get divorced. 

1019
01:01:33,768 --> 01:01:35,858
Let's not waste money

1020
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,288
but get divorced by agreement.

1021
01:01:39,688 --> 01:01:41,978
I'm glad you decided to do that.

1022
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:47,638
What in the world?

1023
01:01:52,248 --> 01:01:53,798
Jung Min Jae.

1024
01:01:56,388 --> 01:02:01,078
You'll have to suffer to come
 to your senses and cave in.

1025
01:02:08,018 --> 01:02:09,738
This is good.

1026
01:02:10,938 --> 01:02:12,848
This is great.

1027
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:16,698
This is great.

1028
01:02:17,628 --> 01:02:21,368
 Jae Hee, Jung Hoo and Noona
 went to the court today. 

1029
01:02:21,368 --> 01:02:23,368
 They're getting divorced 
by agreement. 

1030
01:02:33,978 --> 01:02:38,168
So, should we grab 
lunch somewhere?

1031
01:02:40,718 --> 01:02:43,768
I'd like to, but I have 
an appointment.

1032
01:02:45,258 --> 01:02:48,028
You have lots of appointments.

1033
01:02:49,528 --> 01:02:52,318
I'm sorry. Let's eat next time.

1034
01:02:54,178 --> 01:02:55,378
All right then.

1035
01:02:58,078 --> 01:02:59,478
Min...

1036
01:03:05,478 --> 01:03:06,908
Your underwear...

1037
01:03:16,468 --> 01:03:17,898
Mom!

1038
01:03:19,018 --> 01:03:20,388
Jae Hee.

1039
01:03:20,388 --> 01:03:21,918
Is it over already?

1040
01:03:28,078 --> 01:03:30,488
This is how you ended up.

1041
01:03:30,488 --> 01:03:32,228
I beg you so much.

1042
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:34,368
Was it that difficult to 
apologize to Mom?

1043
01:03:34,368 --> 01:03:36,848
- Jae Hee, Father did...
- That's right.

1044
01:03:36,848 --> 01:03:38,248
It was difficult.

1045
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:40,178
Why should I apologize?

1046
01:03:40,178 --> 01:03:43,298
I've worked my fingers 
to the bone all my life.

1047
01:03:43,298 --> 01:03:45,628
Until my number four and five 
cervical vertebrae collapsed.

1048
01:03:45,628 --> 01:03:48,848
Is it criminal to work 
my butt off for my family?

1049
01:03:48,848 --> 01:03:50,538
Is that something I 
should apologize for?

1050
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:52,058
That's not what I'm saying!

1051
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:53,258
Let's go, Jae Hee.

1052
01:03:53,258 --> 01:03:55,188
What are we doing in 
the middle of the street?

1053
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:57,308
I gave it all in my life for nothing,

1054
01:03:57,308 --> 01:03:58,968
and you two are in this together.

1055
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,118
Honey.

1056
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:02,358
Don't call me, "honey," 
Ms. Jung Min Jae.

1057
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:04,458
Why am I your honey?

1058
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:07,988
Woo Jae Hee, change your 
surname while you're at it.

1059
01:04:07,988 --> 01:04:10,748
Take your mom's last name, and 
change your name to Jung Jae Hee.

1060
01:04:10,748 --> 01:04:12,088
Have a nice life, you two!

1061
01:04:12,088 --> 01:04:14,828
Yes. I'll do that if you want me to.

1062
01:04:14,828 --> 01:04:16,448
All right. Do that.

1063
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:19,478
Jung Min Jae, Jung Jae Hee,
 have a nice life.

1064
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:22,468
Even if we bump into 
each other, don't say hi.

1065
01:04:23,948 --> 01:04:25,378
Jung Hoo.

1066
01:04:25,378 --> 01:04:26,848
Yes, I'll do that.

1067
01:04:26,848 --> 01:04:29,098
I'll never speak to you again!

1068
01:04:30,248 --> 01:04:32,278
Why don't you shut your mouth?

1069
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:33,438
Mom.

1070
01:04:33,438 --> 01:04:35,078
You're the same.

1071
01:04:35,078 --> 01:04:37,558
You two are exactly the same.

1072
01:04:38,778 --> 01:04:41,018
- Mom.
- Don't follow me!

1073
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,278
Geez.

1074
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,158
Yes, manager.

1075
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:03,658
I left the headquarter 
and am on my way.

1076
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:07,358
Then can I go after lunch?

1077
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:10,338
Yes, thank you.

1078
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,478
Koala?

1079
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,798
Ta-da! Surprised?

1080
01:05:48,538 --> 01:05:50,198
Koala.

1081
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:55,278
Mr. Woo.

1082
01:05:57,658 --> 01:05:59,638
Is something wrong?

1083
01:06:00,808 --> 01:06:03,208
No. I'll see you at home.

1084
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:09,898
Come. I'll give you a ride.

1085
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:11,418
It's okay.

1086
01:06:11,418 --> 01:06:13,178
- Come.
- I said, it's okay.

1087
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,578
- Come!
- It's okay.

1088
01:06:14,578 --> 01:06:20,398
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1089
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:28,398
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1090
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:34,908
♫  We're drawn to each 
other like the magnets  ♫

1091
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:44,338
♫  So that we can fill in 
a hole in our heart  ♫

1092
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:55,258
♫  When I see you, I can smile  ♫

1093
01:06:55,258 --> 01:07:03,268
♫  You became a place to 
rest after a hard day  ♫

1094
01:07:03,268 --> 01:07:10,778
♫  The rain called you is 
making me wet  ♫

1095
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:16,658
♫  I got soaked in an 
unexpected love  ♫

1096
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,818
♫  In my meaningless life  ♫

1097
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:21,538
 

1098
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,848
 I don't get Dirctor Jang Seo Ah. 

1099
01:07:22,848 --> 01:07:25,838
 I don't know why she keeps
 sending you out of the office. 

1100
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:27,738
 She's so different from the CEO. 

1101
01:07:27,738 --> 01:07:28,698
 Maybe because she's 
not her real daughter.  

1102
01:07:28,698 --> 01:07:30,808
 Didn't you know? She remarried. 

1103
01:07:30,808 --> 01:07:32,328
 - Is Father doing well?
- What? 

1104
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:34,948
 Jung Hoo is full of energy. 

1105
01:07:34,948 --> 01:07:38,138
 Wow, I don't know where 
he gets his energy. 

1106
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,128
 He eats well, too. 

1107
01:07:40,128 --> 01:07:42,098
 He's full of energy these days. 

1108
01:07:42,098 --> 01:07:43,268
 Min Jae... 

1109
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,458
 While looking through the 
CCTVs around your company, 

1110
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:48,148
 we came across the same 
person several times. 

1111
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,218
 He's wearing the same shoes. 

1112
01:07:51,148 --> 01:07:52,518
 Please come this way.
