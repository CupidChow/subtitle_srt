1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,290
I... 
      

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,190
I stole you.

3
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,880
I stole you from them.

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,370
Mom...

5
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,940
You won.

6
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,920
Now you're even saying like that?

7
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,690
I guess you really want to send me away.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,020
I get it.

9
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,080
I'll go.

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,550
I'll leave right now.

11
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,350
Chae Woon.

12
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,150
Chae Woon, Chae Woon!

13
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,150
Chae Woon, why are you being like this?

14
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,150
Listen carefully to me.

15
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,410
I'm not joking, and I'm not lying to you.

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,190
So?

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,740
How did you steal me from them?

18
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,640
Tell me!

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,360
I went to your house from time to time

20
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,120
and took care of you.

21
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,790
But then,

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,870
you were so... you were so adorable.

23
00:01:52,850 --> 00:02:00,260
The factory I was working back then was moving so I had to move,

24
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,690
but I just couldn't part from you.

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,550
Because I was so adorable?

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,950
You liked me a lot from then.

27
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,450
Then, we are meant to be together.

28
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,850
I don't know.

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,430
I don't know if we were meant to be.

30
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,930
Mom, did somebody ask you to do this?

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,280
Is it somebody called Byun Mi Ja?

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,740
That person, Byun Mi Ja, she's not a sister of a person that you know, is she?

33
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,740
Did that person say something to you? Did she?

34
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,280
Did she threaten you?

35
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,940
No, it's not like that.

36
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,600
She said I should just live with you.

37
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,620
Because CEO Kim Jung Won abandoned me.

38
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,400
That's a strange person. What nonsense.

39
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,380
Don't worry about it, mom.

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,540
I'm fine even there's plenty of people like her come to me.

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,430
Are you getting threatened by somebody? Tell me.

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,600
There's nothing like that.

43
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,180
Even so, I'm not afraid of anything like that.

44
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,650
I'll protect you no matter what.

45
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,920
I'm going to protect you!

46
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,120
She stole me?

47
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,580
My mom is not that kind of a person.

48
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,010
There's going to be something.

49
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,790
Really? I can go to France?

50
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,100
I thought a lot about how hard you worked for this.

51
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,700
But going there doesn't guarantee you that you'll be successful.

52
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,730
- Because more than half of the people get eliminated. 
 - I'll really do my best!

53
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,910
Thank you! Thank you so much!

54
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,150
But, when do I need to leave for France?

55
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,070
I think the end of this month. People who are leaving for that will start to live together for training soon.

56
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,120
You know you have to leave your home, right?

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,900
I already got prepared to leave the family.

58
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,100
I have to be strong! This is going to be my last chance.

59
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,830
- Hello again. 
 - What is this? I came to the upstairs.

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,500
Why are you still here?

61
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,440
- I know that you got fired. 
 - I didn't get f-fired...

62
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,710
I'm here to grab my stuff.

63
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,290
Oh, right! I wasn't able to answer about my dream.

64
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,650
What?

65
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,520
  - What is your dream? 
 - I don't have a dream. It disappeared.  

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,290
I have a new dream now.

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,570
It's more like the dead dream came back to life?

68
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,650
Is that so. I came all the way up here to just hear about this.

69
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,050
So, what is your dream?

70
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,520
An idol. I was a trainee before, and I got chosen again!

71
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,250
This time, I'm going to make it with all of my strength in my life.

72
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,850
What? You shouldn't use all of your strength for it.

73
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,350
I think it's going to be hard, isn't it?

74
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,150
My goodness! That's... Don't you have any shoes?

75
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,020
No. That was my only shoes. I don't wear something that's not my style.

76
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,140
If I'm going to wear something that I don't like, I prefer this. It's fun and hip, isn't it?

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,100
Then, I'll get going. Bye.

78
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm not embarrassed about it at all!

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,730
What is that?

80
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,050
What's wrong with him?

81
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,490
Oh my god, it's like a movie.

82
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,680
Why is my mom here? Is her store opened in this area as well?

83
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,860
If she knew that I came back to Korea after leaving saying I don't want to work for her company, I'll be in big trouble.

84
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,020
Wait a second.

85
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,620
  Why did you tell that to Min Jae?  

86
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,750
I told you not to tell her!

87
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,600
Jae Hee oppa is in a relationship with Bit Chae Woon.

88
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,250
What?

89
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,250
That's why I told her about that.

90
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,050
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,230
Bit Chae Woon and Jae Hee are having a relationship?

92
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,050
Are you sure about that?

93
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,850
Yes, I saw them with my eyes.

94
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,000
How can Jae Hee have a relationship with Bit Chae Woon?

95
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,920
How can he date her out of all women?

96
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,360
I got really upset and angry, so I was talking about that to Jae Hee's mother and accidentally told her.

97
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,850
I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry.

98
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,250
Seo Ah... Calm down.

99
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,690
- You're going to get sick again. 
 - Bit Chae Woon...

100
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,830
She took you away from me, and now she took Jae Hee oppa as well.

101
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,720
- How can she be like that to me? 
 - How can you think like that?

102
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,070
To me, you and Bit Chae Woon are all my daughters!

103
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,370
We're the same?

104
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,550
Mom.

105
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,110
Do you really think that?

106
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,040
Bit Chae Woon is the one who came back to you after 20 years.

107
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,850
How can she be the same with me?

108
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,050
I only have you in this whole world. Even if my real mom came back to life!

109
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,070
I only have you, and you're more precious than my own life!

110
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,390
- It's not like that, Seo Ah! 
 - Mom, how can you...

111
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,040
You're being really mean to me!

112
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,330
Calm down! Seo Ah!

113
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,290
Seo Ah! Breathe in! Take a big breath in! Calm down.

114
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,760
  Now that she knows that Jae Hee oppa and Bit Chae Woon is dating,  

115
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,310
  I bet mom wouldn't feel comfortable as well.  

116
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,440
  If she knows how her real daughter is the source of trouble,  

117
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,750
  she's not going to be just happy about finding her.  

118
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,850
You should wipe the water off your face.

119
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,670
And tears as well.

120
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,980
Why did you get hurt?

121
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,170
Ah, I was riding a motorcycle.

122
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,300
Why did you cry?

123
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,950
I didn't cry.

124
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,090
I thought you cried. I was worried about you.

125
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,710
Who carries around something like this these days?

126
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,710
It looks nice to carry something like this.

127
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,140
It looks like I'm getting loved by my family.

128
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,350
Because I don't have parents.

129
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,350
Thank you for this.

130
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,700
Jang Seo Ah, why are you crying?

131
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,460
Your charm is pretending to be strong.

132
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,880
I know that you're not.

133
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,050
That was definitely the smell of Woo Jung Hoo.

134
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,590
  What are you doing?  

135
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,450
Woo Jung Hoo was there. But why?

136
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,150
Lee Soon Jung is not that unconscionable person to invite Woo Jung Hoo behind my back.

137
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,150
    
   
      

138
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,460
Then, what should I do now?

139
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,930
So you really didn't know that Park Pil Hong got released from prison?

140
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,470
  I really didn't know about that!  

141
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,750
  I think Chul Gu lied about blocking Pil Hong from getting out of prison.  

142
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,580
Alright.

143
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,130
You should...

144
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,770
You should just take care of what I asked you to do.

145
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,550
Ms. Goo!

146
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,340
Mr. Hwang Na Ro, are you already getting off from work?

147
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,350
I saw that you got to work late.

148
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,620
I'm a freelancer.

149
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,740
I believe it's on the contract that the time to come and get off from work was my freedom.

150
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,390
- Did you get injured? 
 - Ah...

151
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,350
You should be more careful.

152
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,020
I think you should be careful, Ms. Goo.

153
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,690
- So your mother said she doesn't know Byun Mi Ja? 
 - No.

154
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,840
I think somebody knows that I'm the real daughter of CEO Kim Jung Won,

155
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,050
so they are sniffing around me and my mom.

156
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,850
Is that so?

157
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,350
Oh, right!

158
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,850
Do you know your name when you were a baby?

159
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,190
It was Park Seo Yeon.

160
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,720
Park Seo Yeon?

161
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,750
What about it?

162
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,590
  - I saw something strange. 
 - Something strange?  

163
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,670
  I went to Na Ro oppa's room to drop off his dried laundry.  

164
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,410
  Wow, he's still working on this!  

165
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,320
  Kim Jung Won, LX?  

166
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,470
    
 Park Seo Yeon?  

167
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,200
  I think it can be his girlfriend's name, but I don't know why CEO Kim Jung Won's name was written on there, too. 

168
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,650
Why did you ask me about that?

169
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,660
  If I talk about this, then she'll be worried about it.  

170
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,850
Nothing. I was just wondering about that.

171
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,140
Park Seo Yeon is a pretty name as well. Right?

172
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,980
But I think Moong-i is the prettiest.

173
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,320
I think Koala is prettier as well.

174
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,350
You must be having a hard time these days.

175
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,550
It must be confusing, too.

176
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,870
I waited to meet my real mom since I was young,

177
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,100
but I didn't know it would be this hard.

178
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,390
I'm worried about the CEO, and I'm more worried about my mom.

179
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,450
If I have two moms, then I should be happier.

180
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,670
But I wonder why it's not like that.

181
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,430
It's so cold! It's so cold!

182
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,750
You missed her a lot. You got hurt so much.

183
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:34,450
Don't think about why it became like this, and just focus on one feeling.

184
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,760
The feeling that you missed her, and to your mother, the feeling that you loved her.

185
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,350
It's easy to say it.

186
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,810
Oh?

187
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,250
Is it a group chat?

188
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,860
An emergency meeting?

189
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,550
There's a ghost on the second floor?

190
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,850
I'm really scared every night.

191
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,770
My goodness. Unni!

192
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,330
Why is my room the only room that doesn't get locked?

193
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,710
He's coming into my room any time! And sleep next to me... my goodness.

194
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,550
Auntie, you broke the lock on purpose, didn't you?

195
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,090
What are you talking about now?

196
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,170
There's no ghost in this world!

197
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,050
But maybe there is one time to time.

198
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,960
That can happen.

199
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,180
What's that?

200
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,900
What is it?

201
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,950
Actually, this land where this house is built

202
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:50,350
was a shaman's house a long time ago. I heard it from the chief of our neighborhood.

203
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,720
And there was a really deep well in the front yard.

204
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,130
Really..?

205
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,770
That's so spooky!

206
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,720
I can't sleep on the second floor anymore! I'm going to sleep on the first floor from now.

207
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,930
Do you think the ghost wouldn't follow you to the first floor?

208
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:13,910
I read it in the book that the ghost follows the person they like.

209
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:20,270
Oh! I guess the ghost picked you.

210
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,560
I guess it's a woman ghost.

211
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,610
Why did the ghost pick me?

212
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,900
- But, Hwak Se. 
 - Yes, noonim.

213
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,290
The chief said it's a total lie.

214
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,150
- It's a lie? 
 - Yes.

215
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,660
What was that, noonim! I really got scared!

216
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,420
Look at the cross!

217
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,580
Why are you doing that to me!

218
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,930
  You surprised me!  

219
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,930
But really, she had long hair, so I totally thought it was a woman ghost.

220
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,270
  Her hair was long and white!  

221
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,210
- A guard? 
 - Yes.

222
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,540
You have to be really careful from tonight. You might get caught by the guards.

223
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,390
What should I do? I have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

224
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,620
You should try harder.

225
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,350
Okay. Listen to me.

226
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,350
First of all, don't eat anything three hours before bed. Especially, don't drink any water.

227
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:29,350
Also, go to the bathroom before bed even though you don't want to. At that time, I'll look after you.

228
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,380
Did you get it or not?

229
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,350
I don't know! If I run into anybody, I'm going to pretend to be a ghost and make all of them faint.

230
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,860
Cha Ba Reun, you are really...

231
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,150
Are you the guard tonight?

232
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,600
- No, I was lucky when I was drawing the raffle. 
 - Then who are the guards tonight?

233
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,210
I thought I will have some good night's sleep tonight,

234
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,810
but why am I have to be the guard?

235
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,950
A ghost... My goodness...

236
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,190
But isn't Kim Joon Woo a bad person?

237
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,670
I emphasized that all of the Samgwang people should come to the meeting tonight,

238
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,750
and he didn't even show up.

239
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,500
I put his name on the guard list for tomorrow,

240
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,490
so if he doesn't come out for that, you can call him out and yell at him.

241
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,350
Yes, I should give him a good lesson.

242
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,650
What's going on?

243
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,670
- Eems hyung? 
 - Do you need something?

244
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,720
I got scared to sleep by myself.

245
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,360
I'm going to sleep here with you guys.

246
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,170
Oh, you're scared to sleep alone.

247
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,080
But the hospital said you shouldn't sleep somewhere cold!

248
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,090
- Then, should we put a heating mat? 
 - No, that's not enough!

249
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,020
Who's the guard tomorrow?

250
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,860
I'll open the door!

251
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,580
Who are you?

252
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,660
I'm Woo Jae Hee's mother.

253
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,890
Koala's mother?

254
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,520
Koala?

255
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,520
- One second, please. 
 - Wait, wait!

256
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,850
I'm happy that you don't have to be guarding in a cold place.

257
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,850
Father--

258
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,150
James, it's all because of you. Thank you.

259
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,350
I'll try to pull the same thing tomorrow as well.

260
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,050
Wouldn't that crazy woman be caught by tonight or tomorrow?

261
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,260
I guess so. It's warm in here.

262
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,050
- Mom! 
 - Mom?

263
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,720
The pretty woman from the other time?

264
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,750
I knew it.

265
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,250
Mom, how did you...

266
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,950
Because you kept hiding something from me, so I had to raid you in the middle of the night.

267
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,620
- What's going on? Why are you here! 
 - I'm sorry?

268
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,000
- What's going on? She's Jae Hee's mother, right? 
 - Yes.

269
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
But why does she know Eems hyung as well?

270
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,850
I'm asking you why you're here. Answer to my question, Woo Jung Hoo!

271
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,350
Woo... Woo Jung Hoo?

272
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,070
Are you making fun of me?

273
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,230
- James. 
 - Y-Yes.

274
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,550
Can you leave us alone for a second? I have something to talk about with my mom--

275
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,850
Who is James! What the hell are you talking about!!

276
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,050
Y-Yes, I'll leave you alone.

277
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,260
  Excuse me.  

278
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,780
What?

279
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,060
What is going on?

280
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,260
What's wrong with your father!

281
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,000
Mom...

282
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,980
Jae Hee's mother is here?

283
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,730
Yes. But it didn't seem okay.

284
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,480
Ah-ha.

285
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:49,530
- I think his mother figured out about you and Mr. Woo are dating. 
   - What? Are you guys dating?!  

286
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,500
- How did you know about that, auntie? 
 - How did I know about that?

287
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,570
I heard it from Hwak Se.

288
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,640
- Wow, how can you not talk about this big news, unni? 
 - It's not like that yet.

289
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,040
I don't think they're officially dating yet.

290
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,690
I think you wish it's not like that yet.

291
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,880
You're the same, auntie. You are sharing too much information with Hwak Se.

292
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:16,270
- What about it? 
 - Wait, I thought Mr. Woo was in a relationship with Jang Seo Ah.

293
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,830
- I think that was-- 
    - That was not true! 

294
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,030
Jang Seo Ah is Koala-- no, I mean Mr. Woo's friend's younger sister.

295
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,560
Then, why did his mother come here in the middle of the night?

296
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,610
I forgot to tell you about this, but she was here earlier today as well.

297
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,950
She was here before?

298
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:45,100
- Maybe she's angry about taking her son away? 
 - It's nothing like that! She's an awesome person.

299
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,450
- Did you already introduce to each other? 
 - It's not like that!

300
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,150
  - It's nothing like that, mom!   
 - Your face got red.

301
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,850
I was wondering about that, too.

302
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,250
- You guys were all here. 
 - Oh, James!

303
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,850
James.

304
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,390
What is going on there?

305
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,770
Well, I don't know. I heard they have something to talk about it.

306
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,280
So... your father is amnesia?

307
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,550
- Amnesia, what should we do..? 
 - Mom! Are you okay?

308
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,950
Should I call a doctor? There's a doctor in this house. I'll call her right now, give me one second.

309
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,150
Hey!

310
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,700
How can you hide this big news from me?

311
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,150
Even though we are divorced, how can you hide this? How can you?

312
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,670
I thought you might get shocked. You're on treatment right now.

313
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:46,240
Even though, so! How can Woo Jung Hoo become like that and he's in Lee Soon Jung's house?

314
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,470
Mom, do you know the owner of this place?

315
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,060
Then, let's do this way.

316
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,020
How?

317
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:20,450
Just hide him here as you did it until now.

318
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:27,180
Don't tell anybody that he is your father, that he's Woo Jung Hoo, who is my ex-husband.

319
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,550
How can I do that after you marching in here like this?

320
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,750
Also, I was really having a hard time! I thought my head was going to explode to think about ways--

321
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,750
You started this in the first place!

322
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:46,950
Especially, don't tell this to the owner of this place, Lee Soon Jung.

323
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,190
Why?

324
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,550
  Because it's about my pride.  

325
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,280
  How is your husband?  

326
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,660
  He's doing great! He's busy with his company.  

327
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,720
  And he's still a blunt person.  

328
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,550
How do you know the owner of this place?

329
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,570
You don't have to know about that. But did you understand what I said?

330
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,590
What were you doing?

331
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,010
I-It was nothing... Hello, welcome.

332
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,830
- Welcome! Hello. 
 - Hello.

333
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,150
I must have surprised you. I'm sorry to come abruptly late at night.

334
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,650
No, it's fine.

335
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,710
- I'm just wondering-- 
 - Where's your mother?

336
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,410
She's right there.

337
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,060
Mom! This is Jae Hee's mother.

338
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,250
Yes!

339
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,420
Welcome.

340
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,150
Oh, young lady Min Jae!

341
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,620
My goodness! It is you, right? What are the odds!

342
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,840
Min Jae unni! You were the girl of the house where our Soon Jung unni worked.

343
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,600
- Who are you..? 
 - Don't you remember me?

344
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,650
It's me, Man Jung! I visited your place every school vacation.

345
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,900
  Oh, right. Soon Jung's younger sister, Man Jung. 

346
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,630
But you became old.

347
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,860
I know! I spent my youth studying hard.

348
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,130
She's a doctor now.

349
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,920
- She was famous for being smart back in the days. 
 - Right.

350
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,840
Oh my, he's your son! My goodness!

351
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,100
Mr. Woo, then your mother is...

352
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,300
Yes, she's my mother.

353
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:11,650
My son praised a lot about the owner of the house's cooking skills but didn't know it was you, Soon Jung.

354
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:17,730
Then, when you were young, did you and CEO Kim Jung Won all lived in the same neighborhood?

355
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,950
Right. I was your mother's place's--

356
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:29,650
Yes, we all lived in the same neighborhood. Jung Won lived right next door to our place. Right?

357
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:51,930
Do you really don't know who I am? Do you really don't remember me?

358
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,750
I-I'm sorry...

359
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,650
I lost my memories because of an accident.

360
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,950
Do I owe you something..?

361
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,120
Don't worry. I'm not a debt collector.

362
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,210
Ah, is that so.

363
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,830
How can you... What should I do...

364
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,160
What should I do...

365
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,750
Mom.

366
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,160
- James, I'll take her to her place, so you should go back inside first. 
 - Ah, Yes.

367
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,800
It was nice meeting you.

368
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,570
How can you say that to me!

369
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,930
  Mom!  

370
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,950
- James! Mom is just being sensitive, so you should go back inside. 
 - Okay.

371
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,600
What should I do...

372
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:06,880
What should I do? How did he change so much? What happened to him? Tell me!

373
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:14,270
What should I do! Jae Hee, what should we do now?

374
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:30,600
  My goodness! It is you, right? What are the odds!  

375
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,430
  James didn't eat anything for the check-up.  

376
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,340
  Is that so? Thank you so much for taking care of him.  

377
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,840
  Why don't you sleep with me in my room tonight?  

378
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,050
  - Can I do that? 
 - Yes, sure.  

379
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,350
How did I not notice that?

380
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,150
     

381
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,970
CEO.

382
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,350
The chairwoman is here.

383
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,520
You're here.

384
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,550
You were calling me day and night, so I couldn't stand it.

385
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,660
I knew you were going to be in Korea.

386
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,410
You knew about it.

387
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:40,010
You haven't called me the whole time, and why are you all of a sudden talking about nonsense?

388
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,950
Grandma!

389
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:48,180
- Grandma! 
 - My princess. How have you been?

390
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:54,030
I missed you so much! Were you in Korea? I thought you were in New York.

391
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,150
I didn't even know about that! That makes me sad, grandma.

392
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,280
I'm sorry, princess.

393
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,590
I was busy.

394
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,500
You like this grandma so much! My princess!

395
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,410
But why did you get so skinny? Are you sick or something?

396
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,100
- No, I'm fine. 
 - You should take care of your child more!

397
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,850
  No, grandma. I'm healthy!  

398
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,150
Of course, you should be healthy, my princess! You're the future of our company!

399
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,050
- Have a seat. Your legs are going to be tired. 
 - Shall we?

400
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,370
Mom.

401
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,630
We should talk.

402
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,010
Talk right here.

403
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,550
Let's go into my room.

404
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,250
I'll be back from talking with your mom, my princess.

405
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,250
Yes.

406
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:00,970
How can my Seo Ah princess have so much elegance?

407
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,560
A good family's blood is different.

408
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:11,090
She's not biologically my granddaughter, but she's exactly like me.

409
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,570
That's funny.

410
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,260
How can you love Seo Ah this much when you don't even like your own children?

411
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,540
How can I not love her?

412
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:29,160
All because of her family, our failing company got revived.

413
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,260
The position you're at now is all thanks to Seo Ah's family.

414
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,830
- She's the treasure to us! 
 - Mom!

415
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,670
I told you I hate that way of putting it!

416
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:53,530
By the way, why are you suddenly keep asking me about Seo Yeon?

417
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,330
I found her.

418
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,650
What?

419
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,850
How can you find a person who doesn't exist in this world anymore?

420
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,790
You really didn't know about this?

421
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,750
You really didn't know that Seo Yeon is alive?

422
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:21,550
What are you talking about now? How do I know that?

423
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,850
At that time, son-in-law Park, no I meant,

424
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,490
I followed Park Pil Hong and saw it with my eyes.

425
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,150
Then, you really saw the body of Seo Yeon?

426
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:48,190
At that time, I was so shocked and freaked out

427
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,820
that I was not in my sane condition for days. Don't you remember that?

428
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,450
Then, wait a minute.

429
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,330
Did Park Pil Hong that bastard took our Seo Yeon away at that moment?

430
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,750
Yes, that's right. It must be done by him, Park Pil Hong.

431
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,200
  I guess Park Pil Hong did it.  

432
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,150
My Jung Won. I'm back.

433
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,970
Pil Hong oppa, the one who you loved.

434
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,300
Seo Yeon, your daddy's back.

435
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,700
You waited for me for a long time, my daughter.

436
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,250
Let's all live together now.

437
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:14,830
Yes, I should tell everything to Moong-i.

438
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,640
  Moong-i, can I talk to you for a second?  

439
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,650
- Mom! 
 - Yes?

440
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,460
Mother, you weren't sleeping yet?

441
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,720
You guys then...

442
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,290
Please allow us, mother!

443
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,580
There's nothing for me to allow or not.

444
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,560
I know that you're a good person.

445
00:37:54,950 --> 00:38:00,150
But do you really don't have any relationship with Jang Seo Ah?

446
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,450
There's nothing going on with me and Jang Seo Ah.

447
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,490
Mom, why were you out in the living room?

448
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:20,750
Mr. Woo, I'm really suspicious about this, about James.

449
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,600
Isn't he your father?

450
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,070
How did you know about that?

451
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,270
- Really? 
 - Oh, I was right. I had a feeling.

452
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,820
It all makes sense now.

453
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,650
I had a strange feeling from the moment when I met him.

454
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,920
But the time passed so much.

455
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,070
You must be surprised.

456
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,270
But I didn't know that you knew my father as well.

457
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:01,950
But why your mother didn't search for your father?

458
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,510
Ah, actually, they had been separated for a while.

459
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,800
Also, my mom wasn't in a good condition, so I didn't tell her about him.

460
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:22,820
You must have had a hard time. Your father's like that, too.

461
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:28,680
Thank you for saving my father when the accident happened, and taking care of him until now.

462
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:34,000
I couldn't say thank you for those reasons until now, but thank you for everything.

463
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,910
It was nothing, Mr. Woo.

464
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:45,810
Even if it wasn't James, no I meant your father. Whoever it was, we would've done the same thing.

465
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,260
But, since now we all know about this,

466
00:39:53,450 --> 00:40:00,380
I think it's not right to have your father here.

467
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,400
Ah...

468
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,520
I agree with you.

469
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:12,950
But my father is finding mental stability while his staying here.

470
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:18,230
So I'm worried if the environment changes, it might affect him.

471
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:24,340
He still gets surprised easily and sometimes he loses consciousness as well.

472
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:31,110
Right. Then, let's think about this more.

473
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,260
- I'm sorry. 
   - No, it's fine.  

474
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:44,430
Then, maybe not right away, but it'll be better to tell other Samgwang family about this as well.

475
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,490
Yes, I think so, too.

476
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,070
Have a good night, mother!

477
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,900
How did that happen?

478
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,240
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell you this earlier, Chae Woon.

479
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:08,630
Since my mom was here today, I was going to tell you all about this, but I missed the chance to tell you.

480
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,540
I'm just saying, you must have been had a lot in your mind the whole time.

481
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,410
By the way, I thought you and your father were getting along with each other well,

482
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,140
but I guess it was because you guys are father and son.

483
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,380
Is that so?

484
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,280
I don't know my father's face,

485
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:51,590
but if I run into him somewhere, will I feel some connection?

486
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,560
And we'll get along with each other?

487
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,130
I think so.

488
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,470
Moong-i's father will be strong like you,

489
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,170
and his head is going to be rock-hard as well.

490
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,150
James was Jung Hoo oppa...

491
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,050
Father...

492
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,840
It would be nice if your memory suddenly comes back tomorrow.

493
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,650
  Jung Min Jae, Jung Jae Hee, have a good life! Even if you see me on the street, don't ever talk to me again!  

494
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,580
  Why did you get married to me?  

495
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,450
  Don't say anything to me, Ms. Jung Min Jae. Why am I your husband?  

496
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:44,400
If you yelled at me and broke up with me, then you should have a good life.

497
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,850
But what happened?

498
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,510
Uncle! You're having a bad dream!

499
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:46,280
It's Buddhism! Namu Amita Bul!

500
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,110
You're Ra Hoon's girlfriend..?

501
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,070
Hello.

502
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,890
Why are you here?

503
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,160
- You're Kim Joon Woo, right? 
 - Kim Joon Woo?

504
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,150
I'm sorry, noona. She doesn't have a place to go, so she's staying here for a little while, I'm so sorry.

505
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,240
Stop kidding me!

506
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:15,120
You disguised to be a boy and came in here to be with my brother, right?

507
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,660
- That's right. 
 - That's right?

508
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,320
Wow, you're like the movie 'Misery!'

509
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,930
- I can't let you be here. 
 - Noona!

510
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,840
Let's just let it go tonight. I'll make sure that she's leaving by tomorrow.

511
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,650
- I'm sorry. 
 - You're the same person! How can you hide her from us!

512
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,360
- You should follow me. 
 - Noona, stop!

513
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,980
- Get out of my way! 
 - Hae Deun!

514
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:46,830
My goodness. It's late now, and tonight it was already disturbed with Jae Hee's mother,

515
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,370
so let's sleep for now and talk about this tomorrow.

516
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,850
I'm going to let you go because today's a special day!

517
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,610
You should leave our house early in the morning tomorrow. Did you get it?

518
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,520
- Unni, but... 
 - What?

519
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,830
Can I go to the bathroom..?

520
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,740
Yes, your face doesn't look okay. Go, go, now.

521
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,140
- You are really--! 
 - She has to go to the bathroom...

522
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,450
  - Hae Deun...   
 - Oh, no, uncle! Are you okay?

523
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:27,570
Have as much as you want.

524
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,770
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

525
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:38,450
Please! Let me do that for you.

526
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,980
Thank you.

527
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,610
There's something strange going on this morning.

528
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,550
  I know.  

529
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:59,000
What's so strange about it? James, I know you like tofu. Have some more.

530
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,140
Thank you.

531
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:11,250
What's strange about is, unni, the way you're treating James is as if he's your in-law.

532
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,530
  Auntie!  

533
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,670
What? What are you talking about?

534
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,270
Why are you guys overreacting? Bit Chae, you're very polite right now, too.

535
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,400
I know, it's weird.

536
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,280
I'm always polite, auntie.

537
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,850
Yes, she's always polite.

538
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,250
What about me? I'm polite, too, right?

539
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,410
Hey, did Cha Ba Reun leave?

540
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,830
Hae Deun, what's that?

541
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,350
It's just a trendy thing.

542
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,860
  Jung Hoo oppa.  

543
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,580
  When did you get this old?  

544
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,210
- Are you hanging laundry? I'll help you with that. 
 - No, it's okay. I can do it.

545
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,360
What's wrong?

546
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,540
N-No, it's nothing.

547
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,950
  - Oh, no, Ms. Goo. Are you okay?   
 - I'm fine.

548
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,650
Ms. Goo!

549
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:32,940
Are you okay? I heard you got into a car accident. What happened?

550
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,730
  I was waiting for the signal, and the car in the back suddenly hit me.  

551
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:40,660
CEO! There's a meeting outside for the Spain project today.

552
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,550
- What should we do? 
 - I can do it. I can accompany you, CEO.

553
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:49,550
No. We have to go around a lot of places, and you shouldn't go around in this condition.

554
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:56,950
Can I accompany the CEO today? I prepared well for the project.

555
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,520
That sounds great. I saw the report that you sent me this morning, and it was good.

556
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,360
- Byun Mi Ja said she'll meet up with you finally? 
 - Yes.

557
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,080
I had been pushing her about that.

558
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,010
You did the right thing, Moong-i.

559
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,110
- I'm going to meet her right there. 
 - Wait.

560
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,330
Then, why don't we try something?

561
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:24,890
What?

562
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,590
Let's make a bold move.

563
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,350
Hello.

564
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,850
- Thank you for meeting up with me. 
 - No problem.

565
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,350
- Have a seat. 
 - Yes.

566
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,170
What do you want to discuss with me?

567
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,570
Oh, it's about...

568
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,370
It's a thing that's related to a lot of money.

569
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,960
Money?

570
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,550
Yes. I felt not okay to talk about this with my mom.

571
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:31,850
So, since you're close with my mom, I thought it would be nice to discuss with you.

572
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,910
Of course! You can discuss this with me.

573
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,550
What money? Is Kim Jung Won going to give you money for you to go away?

574
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,720
Yes. But it was a really huge amount.

575
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,350
Ms. Byun Mi Ja?

576
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,710
I'm detective Goala of Gangnam Police Station.

577
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,600
Yes, what is it?

578
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,400
You know Hwang Na Ro.

579
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:08,220
Who... is that person?

580
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:14,010
Why are you panicking? Hwang Na Ro already told everything.

581
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,010
What are you talking about..?

582
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,630
- Oh! Na Ro! 
 - Ms. Byun Mi Ja!

583
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:28,050
There's no specific criminal circumstance yet, so I can't follow her.

584
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,290
  Moong-i?  

585
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:37,440
How did you know that Hwang Na Ro is related to this?

586
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,150
In fact...

587
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:46,060
  And the other day, Na Ro oppa came to the sandwich shop that I'm working to meet up with this lady.  

588
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:50,100
  But then, when he saw me, they pretend not to know each other.  

589
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,880
  Really?  

590
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,980
  Do you remember her face?  

591
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,660
Hae Deun drew her face well. It shows her characteristics.

592
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,550
So I just made a bold move, but I was right.

593
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,960
  - Why don't you share my umbrella with me? 
 - I'm fine.  

594
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,650
  - I think you need this. 
 - Na Ro!  

595
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:26,550
  - Were you waiting for me? 
 - Yes! Let's go home together.  

596
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:31,150
  Because I like you, Bit Chae Woon.  

597
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,880
Hwang Na Ro...

598
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,500
But then, why?

599
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:59,050
  Moong! Did you get home safely? I wanted to go with you, but I have to work.  

600
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:07,310
  I'm safely at home! Don't worry about me and good luck with your work.  

601
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,940
  My Moong-i! Being strong is your charm!  

602
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,200
Hwang Na Ro...

603
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,520
What the hell is he?

604
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,870
- This is all we got delivered, right? 
 - Yes.

605
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,020
Why are they not delivering the rest yet?

606
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,990
Hwak Se, it's clean here, right?

607
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,650
Eems hyung, you're the best!

608
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,810
Oh, it's Jae Hee's mother.

609
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,610
Hello.

610
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,560
  You visited here again.  

611
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,810
  I guess she's here again because she's worried about Eems hyung.  

612
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:38,680
- You came here too late! 
 - I'm sorry, traffic was heavy!

613
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,930
  Should I put this in here?  

614
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,450
Hello.

615
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,410
Why don't you sit here for a second?

616
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,750
  My legs are hurting. Can we sit here for a second?  

617
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:23,450
  If your legs are hurting, then you should go home.  

618
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:28,270
  Let's go home a little later. Here, here.  

619
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,310
  Let's sit here for a second, shall we?  

620
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:41,080
  My goodness. He never did this before.  

621
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:46,340
  How did you... How did you become such a different person?  

622
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,160
  What happened to you?  

623
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:54,150
  Beautiful woman, why do you look so sad?  

624
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:47,310
Woo Jung Hoo.

625
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,070
We did break up,

626
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,250
but I can't leave you like that.

627
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,020
I can't do that.

628
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:12,850
Oh, is that so? Don't worry about it. I'll go and check it.

629
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,760
- What's going on? 
 - Oh.

630
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:22,080
Your mom left her phone in her room, so she called me with Yeonhui-dong lady's phone.

631
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,970
I'll go and check it.

632
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,910
Oh my, mom.

633
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,400
Well, she can be distracted these days.

634
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,050
     

635
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,150
Chairwoman?

636
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,090
Maybe it's one of the houses that she works for?

637
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,270
- Yes! 
   - It's me, Jung Won's mom.  

638
00:58:55,330 --> 00:59:00,580
  If it's Jung Won's mom, then is she the CEO's mother?  

639
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,270
  Why are you keep texting me?  

640
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,650
  Don't you understand what I'm saying?  

641
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,050
I told you if you took it all over, it'll be done.

642
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,890
  What's good about bringing Seo Yeon to our place now?   

643
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,120
That filthy person Park Pil Hong's child!

644
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:24,700
  Hello? Lee Soon Jung!  

645
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,650
  What a frustrating person...  

646
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,360
- What are you guys doing? 
 - Mom!

647
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,100
- Mom! You're home! 
 - Come on in!

648
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:26,050
Why are you guys all came home so early tonight?

649
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:29,130
Unni called us in. She has to make her a special dinner.

650
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,900
- Big Noona's special dinner is always the same menu of-- 
 - Sujebi?

651
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,770
- That's right! 
 - That's correct!

652
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,940
- But what is all this mess! 
 - Don't worry, we'll clean up later.

653
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:49,700
- But Chae Woon, did you cry? 
 - Right? She looks a bit swollen.

654
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:55,460
No! I ate a lot of bread and then fell asleep. That's why.

655
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,800
Oh, and mom, I left your cell phone on your bureau.

656
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,510
  Oh, okay.  

657
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,510
Oh, no! It's boiling over!

658
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:12,050
- It smells amazing, right? 
 - It's great!

659
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:16,150
  - Is it not enough? Maybe we should've made more? 
 - I think it's more than enough.  

660
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:24,840
This is really good! It's so good!

661
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:30,510
Bit Chae makes amazing sujebi!

662
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:33,150
Is it good? Is it good?

663
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,740
It's so good.

664
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:45,050
- The soup has a deep taste, it's really tasty. 
 - Right?

665
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,550
Oh? I made the base of the soup!

666
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:50,910
The oldest daughter is good at cooking as well.

667
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,160
Why are you being like this to me?

668
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:57,410
By the way, Na Ro and Mr. Woo are being late.

669
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:02,120
That's true! This is better to eat right away.

670
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,050
Koala, what are you doing here?

671
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,180
Were you waiting for me?

672
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,920
Hwang Na Ro.

673
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:25,170
- What? 
 - Let's start with this.

674
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:35,220
- What the hell is going on? 
 - You don't know why I'm being like this?

675
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

676
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,270
  Let's have a beer party!  

677
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,380
This is for you, mom! Oh, no!

678
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,300
  - Your love is overflowing!   
 - Who shook this?

679
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:57,840
- This is for you, auntie. 
 - Let's drink!

680
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,670
You guys might have ate sujebi that deliciously for this moment.

681
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:14,050
Let's listen to our Ra Hoon's singing!

682
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:18,650
The youngest of this family! Lee Ra Hoon!

683
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:25,240
♫  It's real real real It's very real  ♫ 
   Oppa!  

684
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:30,680
♫  The real thing is here now  ♫

685
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:38,100
♫  It's real real real It's very real  ♫

686
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:43,480
♫  I'm going to love you so much   ♫

687
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,860
  You passed the test! You got it!  

688
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:56,540
♫  You're the only one I can trust  ♫ 
   My Ra Hoon is the best singer!  

689
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:26,740
Soon Jung noonim, you should sing!

690
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:30,260
  You should sing! You should sing!  

691
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:33,170
I'll sing later. Okay?

692
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:36,260
Well, then, James!

693
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,110
James!

694
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:46,690
- You should sing! If you can't sing you can't get married. Ah! bad person! 
 - I don't remember any song!

695
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,480
I don't remember anything.

696
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,670
- How can you destroy the mood like this? 
 - Should I sing something?

697
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:57,130
Ah! I remember one song.

698
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:05,090
  It's my sister's favorite song!   
 ♫  I guess I'm still young. Mom! ♫ 

699
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:12,140
♫   Why am I keep waiting   ♫

700
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:18,760
  This chorus is important. It sounds bright, but have to put some sad emotions.  

701
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:29,850
♫  I guess I'm still young  ♫

702
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:39,350
♫  Mom, why am I keep waiting   ♫

703
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:48,250
♫  Mom, why do I suddenly miss  ♫ 
   The lyric is so sad!  

704
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:57,000
  Let's sing it one more time! 
 ♫  I guess I'm still young. Mom!   ♫ 

705
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:04,940
  Mom. I'll go to the CEO's house today.  

706
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:08,260
  I'm going to go there before you turn yourself in.  

707
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:18,140
  I'm just kidding. I'm leaving because I want to go. I think that's the right thing to do.  

708
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:24,550
  You know it's not my style to say goodbye in tears because I'm leaving home. 

709
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:36,770
I'm going to go there and make things right.

710
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,700
I'm going to reveal everything.

711
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,450
Chae Woon...

712
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,850
Chae Woon!

713
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,470
Chae Woon!

714
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:25,050
Chae Woon! Chae Woon! Chae Woon!

715
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,290
Chae Woon...

716
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:33,290
Chae Woon... Chae Woon...

717
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,610
Chae Woon!

718
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,860
Chae Woon!

719
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:48,840
Chae Woon... Chae Woon...

720
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:54,540
Chae Woon...

721
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,620
Chae Woon...

722
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:04,730
♫  The rain called you is making me wet  ♫

723
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:11,200
♫  I got soaked in an unexpected love  ♫

724
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:18,140
♫  In my meaningless life, you became the meaning  ♫

725
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:24,520
♫  The one who taught me love  ♫

726
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,770
♫  Is you  ♫

727
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:35,050
     

728
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,370
  Oh, Ba Reun!  

729
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,680
  Hello, I'm here to apologize to you all.  

730
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,290
  I'm the Kim Joon Woo.  

731
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,500
  Oh, my goodness! She's a stalker! She doesn't look like one, but she was!  

732
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,350
  How can a young guy and girl stay in the same room?   

733
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,350
  Mom! Nothing happened! Nothing happened at all!  

734
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,750
  Who is this girl?  

735
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,150
  - This is Seo Yeon. 
 - Oh my! You were alive!  

736
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,150
  Where and how have you been living? 

737
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:56,650
  Do you really didn't know where and how I had been living?  

738
01:08:56,750 --> 01:09:01,050
  You're ridiculous. Did you really want to come to our house? You're going to take everything from me!  

739
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,350
  Hey, Jang Seo Ah!  

740
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:05,350
  Grandma! Tell her to go away!  

741
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:07,650
  Na Ro, you should leave the Samgwang villa.  

742
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,150
  Just leave quietly now.  

743
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,930
  What did I do wrong? Why are you being like this to me? 

744
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,750
  I told you I didn't do anything!
