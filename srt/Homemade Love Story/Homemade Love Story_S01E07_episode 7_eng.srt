1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,640
  Your biological daughter, Park Seo Yeon.  

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,610
  She's not dead.  

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,800
  She's alive.  

4
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,890
Who the hell are you?

5
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,580
Who are you?

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,120
Who the hell are you?

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,410
Who are you?

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,030
CEO!

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,400
CEO, what's wrong?

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,300
 Don't answer it! Don't! 

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,560
 - Hello?
- Don't answer! 

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,680
 

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,590
Bit Chae Woon?

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,320
What? They're close already?

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,570
Wow, of course.

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,060
Blood is thicker than water.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,220
Much thicker.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,000
- Give me some water.
- Okay.

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,220
Here's water.

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,800
Are you all right?

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,480
Oh, this.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,210
I'm okay.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,730
Thanks.

24
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,090
Yes.

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,420
If you press your fingers
 like this, you'll relax.

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,520
Your other hand.

27
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,340
I'm okay.

28
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,890
Mom, how did...

29
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,350
Good job, Bit Chae Woon.

30
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,130
You can leave now.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Okay.

32
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,590
What's going on, Mom?

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,180
Why was she massaging your hand?

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,890
I just got muscle cramps here.

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,800
Here? Why?

36
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,870
It's because Bit Chae Woon upset you.

37
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,610
No, it happens sometimes.

38
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,260
And I made it clear to Bit Chae Woon.

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,130
She said she'd watch it in the future.

40
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,920
I have to go to the restroom.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,040
Mom.

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,540
Who...

43
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,100
is this?

44
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,910
Oh, yeah, the photo.

45
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,000
It must be Seo Ah's baby picture.

46
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,310
Bit Chae Woon.

47
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,550
Did you say "guilt" earlier?

48
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,000
You're strangely driving
 me into a corner.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,500
You even shocked the CEO.

50
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,030
What are you trying to do?

51
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,030
If you feel it's so unfair,
 bring your proof.

52
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,360
Don't act like a victim.

53
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,070
If I bring the proof,

54
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,220
would you accept it then?

55
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,930
I don't know what you 
want me to accept.

56
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,540
But bring it in.

57
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,200
If you can come up with one.

58
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Oh, yeah?

59
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,800
Where should I get the proof?

60
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,860
Wow, we made so 
much money today.

61
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,430
Let's make even more 
tomorrow, buddy.

62
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,760
Let's do that, buddy.

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,860
I'll get going.

64
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,080
Go home straight. 
Don't go drinking.

65
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,670
Yes, sir!

66
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,590
Geez.

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,070
 I'll meet your mother. 

68
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,980
 That's okay, right? 

69
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,290
 

70
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,280
No, I'm okay.

71
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,540
Mom, you look exhausted.

72
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,590
 

73
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,490
Jae Hee oppa?

74
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,590
Hi, Oppa.

75
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,080
What's up?

76
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,000
Here?

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,530
Right now?

78
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,190
I'll be right there.

79
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,230
- Gosh. 
- But I like Jae Hee oppa.

80
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,680
Oppa!

81
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,050
- Oh, my.
- How did you know?

82
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,180
We were totally shocked earlier...

83
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,120
You came because you're curious 
about my meeting with your mom?

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,260
Yes.

85
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,460
I came by, just in case.
 I'm glad you're on your way out.

86
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,450
I'll drive you home tonight.

87
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,700
Really?

88
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,290
Then, should I go home
 in your car tonight?

89
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,470
Yes, I'll drive you comfortably...

90
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,580
It's raining. Let's hurry.

91
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,520
Me, too.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Gosh, what? It wasn't 
raining all this time.

93
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,540
Geez.

94
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,060
I won't die.

95
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,250
Let's just get wet.

96
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,800
- I can share my umbrella.
- I'm okay.

97
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
I don't think so.

98
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,300
Na Ro!

99
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,900
Your hair falls out if you get rained
 on too much these days.

100
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,100
Come over here.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,300
Let's go.

102
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,300
- What's wrong?
- What?

103
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,640
Hey.

104
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,250
I know you two are 
talking with your eyes.

105
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,700
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,270
Oppa, I told you, right?

107
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,910
The girl who used to bully 
me in middle school

108
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,070
started working at our company.

109
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,820
Yeah, that Headbutt...

110
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Did she cause trouble again?

111
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,600
- Because of her...
- No...

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,890
It's nothing serious.

113
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,800
Focus on your driving with the rain.

114
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,040
Oh, okay.

115
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,290
Gosh, how refreshing.

116
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,330
Didn't you eat lunch?

117
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,000
No.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,280
That's too bad.

119
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,970
- Do you want another bowl?
- No thanks.

120
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,560
I have to eat all this.

121
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,880
I can't believe we bumped 
into each other there.

122
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,620
Oh, I was working at the 
place two buildings down.

123
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,900
- Translation work?
- No.

124
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,500
Interpreting today.

125
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,530
You interpret, too?

126
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,070
Wow, so awesome.

127
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,890
Awesome.

128
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,980
Ma'am, one more plate 
of dumplings, please.

129
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,630
 - Okay! 
- No.

130
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,080
I'm fine with this.

131
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,830
I want to eat some, too.

132
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,130
I'm a total dumpling mania.

133
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,250
Me, too.

134
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,520
Dumplings. Dumplings again today.

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,930
Dumplings again.

136
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,990
Dumplings, dumplings, 
dumplings, dumplings...

137
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,430
Is she addicted to dumplings?

138
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,280
You know phone numbers 
with caller ID restrictions?

139
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,780
That's a bit suspicious, right?

140
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,100
Why? Did you get a call like that?

141
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,620
Not me.

142
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,640
Someone at work.

143
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
It seemed like a crank call,

144
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,010
but she was so shocked.

145
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,350
Someone must've played a bad joke.

146
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,510
Why do they do that?

147
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,160
I've gotten a call like that before, too.

148
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,080
Out of the blue, he said, 
"I'm your biological father."

149
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,760
I was so thrilled.

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,550
Did you try to find your birth parents?

151
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,210
Of course.

152
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,750
But...

153
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,340
when you go with high anticipation, 
and it turns out he's not your father,

154
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,240
the aftermath lasted for so long.

155
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,190
So, I gave up. I decided
 not to look for them.

156
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,140
People who abandoned me

157
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,260
wouldn't want to

158
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,630
find me now for some reason.

159
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,700
It could be that you
 weren't abandoned.

160
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,260
It could be for some 
inevitable circumstances.

161
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,660
Gosh, we live in a different world.

162
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,330
If they wanted to find me, 
they would've right away.

163
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,140
- Here you go.
- It's here.

164
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,770
Thank you.

165
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,080
Whoa, looks good.

166
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,120
All the lights are on.

167
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,230
Yes, that means 
everything is fine, right?

168
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,060
Please do come in the 
morning and double-check.

169
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,560
Yes, thank you.

170
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,530
Everything is fine, right?

171
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah, he'll pay particular attention.

172
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,530
That's weird.

173
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,780
Why is Mom checking on the 
security system all of a sudden?

174
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Mom.

175
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,630
Everything is fine. He'll come by 
in the morning and double-check.

176
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,620
Gosh, thanks, Jae Hee.

177
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,800
I feel so secure since you're 
here to check up on things.

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,910
Tell Joon Ah to come home soon.

179
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,780
What is Joon Ah doing in England?

180
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,490
I know.

181
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm sure Joon Ah oppa got
 snatched up by some woman.

182
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,720
Aigoo, there's no way. 
Not my Joon Ah.

183
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,690
Oh, yeah. About meeting your mom.

184
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,150
I told you everything about it earlier.

185
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,640
So there's nothing 
serious going on, right?

186
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,800
Well, I guess she wanted
 to take a break.

187
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,050
But visit her often and talk
 to her a lot, Mr. Woo.

188
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,170
All right.

189
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,540
Me, too.

190
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,900
Let's go together, Oppa.

191
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,360
Divorce?

192
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,890
Really?

193
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,170
You can't believe it, huh?

194
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,540
You used to tell me all the time

195
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,570
not to live like that and 
find my own life.

196
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,910
But now that I'm doing it,
 you want to stop me, huh?

197
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,940
You have no idea how I've lived.

198
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,580
How meaningless my life has been.

199
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,520
I'll get a divorce.

200
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,710
All right.

201
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,170
Do it.

202
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,110
But don't do it as though 
you're running away.

203
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,810
Don't be emotional about it, either.

204
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,850
Find out why you 
decide to get a divorce,

205
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,600
and what did Jung Hoo do wrong?

206
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,770
Does he want to change 
at all in the future?

207
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,140
Figure out all the details

208
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,930
and talk it out with 
Jung Hoo as well.

209
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll do that, of course.

210
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,300
Jung Won, I'm not running away. 
I want to be independent.

211
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,510
I'm choosing a new life.

212
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,770
Then you shouldn't
 keep it all in like this.

213
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,010
What?

214
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,380
You cried your eyes out, 
holding onto me earlier.

215
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,750
I know you cried because 
you felt your life was so unfair.

216
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,360
Don't cry again in the future.

217
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,820
Choosing a new life...

218
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,960
isn't a tragedy. It's hopeful.

219
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,240
Don't pity yourself.

220
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,320
Okay?

221
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,490
Especially in front of Jung Hoo 
or Jae Hee. Especially more so.

222
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,810
Got it?

223
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,220
Since it's you.

224
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,880
You're the only one I can open up to.

225
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,890
That's why I was bawling with you.

226
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,340
I won't cry again.

227
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,140
Okay.

228
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,010
My friend, you're so awesome.

229
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,570
Why?

230
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,800
Hey.

231
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,720
It makes me wonder about life.

232
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,290
You were so in love with 
Jung Hoo a long time ago,

233
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,520
and you stopped eating, left home.

234
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,140
Your mom came over to 
my house at night in tears...

235
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,570
Aigoo, come on. Speak for 
yourself, Kim Jung Won.

236
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,500
How about you? The one and only 
daughter of a wealthy family

237
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,150
fell for that Park Pil Hong, that jerk...

238
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,960
Aigoo, what's the use in 
talking about it...

239
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,790
Gosh, I ruined my own life.

240
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,830
Geez, you should've 
stopped me then.

241
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,610
What were you doing, 
not stopping me?

242
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,650
How about you?

243
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,640
Honestly, more than your parents,

244
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,460
don't you remember me trying to 
stop you, rolling up my sleeves?

245
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,480
Of course, I do remember.

246
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,970
How about you?

247
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,790
Why wouldn't I remember?

248
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,870
I do remember.

249
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,060
 Jung Min Jae. 

250
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,830
 Be bold and go it alone. 

251
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,690
Go alone!

252
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,910
How will you survive getting
 divorced at your age?

253
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,060
You'll live in dire straits.

254
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,500
Jung Min Jae.

255
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,740
You want to divide up
 the asset and make a fortune

256
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,380
to start a new life, huh?

257
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,400
You can forget about it.

258
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,930
Do you think I'd divorce you?

259
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,760
No way. Never.

260
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,830
What do you take me for?

261
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,200
Ouch...

262
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,530
Ow, ow...

263
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,000
Geez, seriously.

264
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,870
My foot.

265
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,060
Geez, seriously!

266
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,400
 I'm sorry for calling you back late. 

267
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,890
 Soon Jung, sorry. 

268
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,340
 Let's talk later. 

269
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,600
 She must be upset since
 I didn't call her back. 

270
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,420
 It's better this way. 

271
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,210
 It's better to lose touch like this. 

272
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,890
 But how about Chae Woon? 

273
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,140
 How about my Chae Woon... 

274
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,770
Mom.

275
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,430
Chae Woon.

276
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,010
Why do you get startled 
so easily lately?

277
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,460
Are you feeling weak?

278
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,870
Gosh, no.

279
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,410
- I'm home, Mother.
- Oh, yes.

280
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,470
- Na Ro, you came together.
- We ran into each other.

281
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,800
I see.

282
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,260
Mother.

283
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,330
A gift for you.

284
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,690
Oh, my gosh!

285
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,230
Why are you giving this to me?

286
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,460
A gift for accepting me
 into your family.

287
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,830
Thank you, Mother.

288
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,830
My gosh. It's so pretty.

289
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,350
Thank you.

290
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,470
Lucky you, Mom.

291
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,310
Mom, you should dry this 
flower inside your old dictionary.

292
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,420
Should I?

293
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,030
An old dictionary?

294
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,830
There is this thing.

295
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,610
My mom's favorite thing.

296
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,480
- Hi, Mr. Woon.
- Hello.

297
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,500
Mr. Woo.

298
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,940
I got this from Na Ro just now.

299
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,170
Isn't it pretty?

300
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,650
Yeah, well, it is pretty, but...

301
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,350
the flowers nowadays don't 
smell strong like the olden days.

302
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,540
Smells pretty strong to me.

303
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,420
Smells nice.

304
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,730
The flowers from the olden days...

305
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,790
Come in.

306
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,960
You must have rhinitis.

307
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,540
You can't smell.

308
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,180
My nose is totally sensitive.

309
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,390
I see. Is that right?

310
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,510
That's weird.

311
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,490
You're the weirdest one, punk.

312
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,960
Come here! Get over here!

313
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,390
Hey, come here!

314
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,600
Come here!

315
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,380
- Come here. Come.
- What?

316
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,080
- What, what?
- Move, move, move!

317
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,410
Move! Come out here!

318
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,350
- Move, move!
- Ouch!

319
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,630
- What are you doing?
- Auntie!

320
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,290
- Come here.
- Run, run!

321
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,900
Hwak Se, hold onto 
Hae Deun! Hold her!

322
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,400
Uncle, let go!

323
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,890
Hey, come here.

324
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,630
- It hurts!
- Come here.

325
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,240
Come. Follow me!

326
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,320
Come here!

327
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,310
What? What's going on?

328
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,560
Hey!

329
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,040
We were playing around.

330
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,880
- "Mugunghwa has bloomed."
- Freeze!

331
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,660
What do you mean?

332
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,270
- It hurts! Ouch!
- What, what?

333
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,610
I wasn't going to reveal this...

334
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,050
Then don't.

335
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,530
I have to. I must.

336
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,940
Unni.

337
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,900
Look at this.

338
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,510
- What is it?
- Noonim, I'll read it for you.

339
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,990
Ultimate beauty skincare package

340
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,410
for 3 million won.

341
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,920
Uncle, that's a spam mail.

342
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,520
It's a spam.

343
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,100
Spam my foot, girl!

344
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,180
She stole my credit 
card and used it.

345
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,870
Three million won on skincare!

346
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,440
What did you say?

347
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,730
Hae Deun, how can you?

348
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,330
The agency keeps telling
 me that I'm too old.

349
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,460
Saying that my bones are creaking.

350
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,160
And the kids are all saying I have
 wrinkles around my eyes.

351
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,700
So you bought a deal at skincare?

352
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,960
Do you think I'd go bonkers or not?

353
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,660
Hey, Hae Deun, 
even though you needed it,

354
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,670
you can't get blood from a turnip.

355
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,800
Ah, okay.

356
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,280
I told you I'd pay you back in
 12-months installments.

357
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,570
Hey.

358
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,590
Did you ever pay me back after using 
my card behind your mom's back?

359
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,790
And if you'll pay off in 12 months,
 why not use your card?

360
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,290
Why did you use my card?

361
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,160
My card is maxed out...

362
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,980
You should've just borrowed 
Chae Woon noona's card.

363
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,250
Why would I want to get beat up?
 I'd prefer Auntie.

364
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,820
Shut the mouth, Lee Hae Deun.

365
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,450
Get up. Get up.

366
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,160
- Follow me.
- No need.

367
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,200
Lee Hae Deun.

368
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,600
Go there tomorrow and 
cancel the card purchase.

369
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,880
I already received 
one treatment today.

370
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,650
I'll pay you for that. Cancel it.

371
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,220
I still need to get skincare.

372
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,880
Lee Hae Deun!

373
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,370
We're not in a situation
 to spend like that.

374
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,740
You're not able to afford it,

375
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,910
and Auntie can't afford to let 
you use 3 million won on her card.

376
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,620
I mean...

377
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,070
Well, I can afford it, but still...

378
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,100
you shouldn't spend 
3 million won on skincare.

379
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,620
You know that...

380
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,520
we have to move out 
of this house, right?

381
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,680
Yes, Mom.

382
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,340
When we move out,

383
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,120
there isn't a house for
 us to move into.

384
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,380
Mom.

385
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,620
Unni.

386
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,020
Are you opening up about 
me losing the apartment?

387
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,640
I said I'd tell everyone later.

388
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,920
Auntie, did you lose the apartment?

389
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,560
What do we do then?

390
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,140
Lee Hae Deun, that wasn't her fault.

391
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,350
It just turned out that way for her,

392
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,000
and she's not in 
a good situation, either.

393
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,210
Kim Hwak Se, did you tell her 
about the hospital already?

394
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,380
What?

395
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,870
What do you mean?

396
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,820
The reason I'm telling 
you all this is

397
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,060
because we should
 face our reality

398
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,610
and be frugal.

399
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,140
Let's live within our means.

400
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,900
Let's live together 
without fighting like this.

401
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,440
Wait a minute.

402
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,640
So, you're taking me out, right?

403
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,410
- What now...
- I'm really sorry.

404
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,050
I did lose the apartment.

405
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,290
Why did you purchase it 
under my name anyway?

406
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,640
Why did you trust a hopeless fool like 
me and buy it under my name?

407
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,210
Gosh, Man Jung.

408
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,910
At the time, you gave 
me the deposit

409
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,170
and got me the loan. 
Of course, I'd...

410
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,430
I got it.

411
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,390
I got it.

412
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,900
I'm sure Kim Hwak Se told
 you everything, Unni.

413
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,150
Wait, Aunt.

414
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,640
I really didn't say anything.

415
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,920
Forget it.

416
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,370
You know, I...

417
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,880
also wrapped up the 
Jeju Island Hospital.

418
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,900
 What? 

419
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,430
No, I mean, I got fired
 from Jeju Island Hospital.

420
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,770
Unni.

421
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,430
Dr. Song dumped me again.

422
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,950
- Again?
- Man Jung!

423
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,680
Gosh, forget it! Seriously!

424
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,970
I'm really sorry, too!

425
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,830
I hate myself, too.

426
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,470
I'll just disappear.

427
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,690
I'll disappear from 
this Samgwang Villa.

428
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,040
I'm really sorry.

429
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,410
- Hey, Man Jung.
- Auntie!

430
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,610
- Not again!
- Auntie, wait. Auntie!

431
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,000
- Auntie!
- Auntie!

432
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,300
Geez, come on.

433
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,310
Auntie.

434
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,820
Geez.

435
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,900
Auntie, don't do this.

436
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,430
Why do you always 
say you'll leave?

437
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,140
Let go of me!

438
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,390
Hey, I'm just like that.

439
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,920
You guys even gave me a nickname.
 "Hit-the-road Man Jung."

440
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,790
You always "hit the road, Man Jung."

441
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,790
Auntie, don't be like this.

442
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,700
- Come on!
- Let go.

443
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,510
Both of you, let go.

444
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,700
I'm really sorry.

445
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,770
Hey, Hae Deun.

446
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,060
I'll give you that 3 million won
 as my farewell gift.

447
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,370
- Geez, Auntie.
- Auntie...

448
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,710
Auntie.

449
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,160
- Aunt, Aunt.
- Let go.

450
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,120
- What?
- I really didn't say anything.

451
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,490
Forget it.

452
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,390
Congrats. You can sleep
 soundly starting tonight.

453
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,640
Goodnight.

454
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,860
Auntie...

455
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,440
Geez, seriously...

456
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,720
What's with her?

457
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,500
Stop it right here, Auntie.

458
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,710
- Stop what?
- Will you insist on leaving?

459
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,950
If you insist, promise me
 before you go.

460
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,450
- What?
- If you leave now,

461
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,860
you'll never come back.

462
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,680
Unni!

463
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,440
You always take off and 
break my mom's heart.

464
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,460
I'm sick and tired of it!

465
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,350
Promise me.

466
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,760
Deal.

467
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,460
All right. I'll send you 
the money in cash.

468
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,030
I'll send it from my card in parts.

469
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,520
I was giving it to Hae Deun 
as my farewell gift.

470
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,630
But if you send me the cash, 
I'd be grateful. Thank you.

471
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,670
- Auntie. You're so heartless.
- Let go of me.

472
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,630
- Auntie!
- Hey.

473
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,910
Don't.

474
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,600
Lee Hae Deun.

475
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,690
Stop causing trouble now.

476
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,370
How much longer will you 
put it on me? How long?

477
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,490
 If you two will fight like that, 

478
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,890
 fight where there's no one around. 

479
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,130
 - Must you have Mom hear you? 
- Mom.

480
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,210
 I'm always the one to 
resolve problems. 

481
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,200
 Hae Deun. 

482
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,430
 I... 

483
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,000
 I have a headache with
 my issues alone. 

484
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,900
Sorry, Unni.

485
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,540
How much more 
money do you need?

486
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,500
- What?
- Besides skincare.

487
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,800
You must need more 
money to be a trainee.

488
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,210
Can I tell you?

489
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,860
Tell her what, Lee Hae Deun?

490
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,850
Have a sense of shame.

491
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,270
Mom, it's not like that.

492
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,270
You always put 
everything on your sister.

493
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,710
Cancel your skincare right away.

494
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,990
If you don't, I'll do it. Got it?

495
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,400
Mom.

496
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,290
Aigoo, you just can't 
come to your senses.

497
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,300
See that, Lee Hae Deun?

498
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,660
Why is everyone 
taking it out on me?

499
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,480
Bit Chae Woon, how sad...

500
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,640
I should hurry up and rescue her.

501
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,550
Gosh.

502
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,190
My poor daughter.

503
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,750
 This is my Shawshank. 

504
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,370
 This is Alcatraz, an inferno. 

505
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,450
 You guys are the zombies. 

506
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,350
 You're the load on my back. 
Bringing me down! 

507
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,500
Aigoo...

508
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,730
My daughter, Chae Woon.

509
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,800
With a wonderful mom
 so close by,

510
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,890
she shouldn't be 
suffering here like this.

511
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,960
My Chae Woon shouldn't be
 with such a sucky mom.

512
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,740
Aigoo, it's my fault.

513
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,730
Mom?

514
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,430
Yeah.

515
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,700
Are you okay?

516
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,110
Of course.

517
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,520
Mom.

518
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,840
Sorry. I'll cancel it tomorrow.

519
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,870
Yeah.

520
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,110
Make sure you cancel it tomorrow.

521
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,050
Mom.

522
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,330
Ra Hoon, did you wash your feet?

523
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,560
Of course, I washed them clean.

524
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,130
Get out.

525
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,240
Out.

526
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,470
Mom.

527
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,730
Let's feel better, okay?

528
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,890
Hae Deun feels bad.

529
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,190
Chae Woon.

530
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,010
Huh?

531
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,340
What?

532
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,210
Sorry.

533
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,900
Why would you be sorry for me?

534
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,040
I'm sorry.

535
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,860
For putting on the heavy 
load on you every time.

536
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,150
My mom is acting weird today.

537
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,800
This won't do.

538
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,930
We should grab a drink.

539
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,580
What should we drink?

540
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,580
What should we drink?

541
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,910
Well...

542
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,920
Do you want me to
 lend you some money?

543
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,410
You don't have any money.

544
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,950
Well...

545
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,440
I do have some saved up.

546
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,330
Forget it. I don't need
 money from a kid.

547
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,260
Go and buy yourself some cookies.

548
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,580
Cookies...

549
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,400
Hey, I'm not a kid.

550
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,770
Watch it.

551
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,270
Go now.

552
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,000
Go.

553
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,910
Look at you.

554
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,720
You said we'd make it simple, 
yet you prepared all this.

555
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,300
I'm having a drink with
 my precious daughter.

556
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,550
I should set a pretty table.

557
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,110
Mom.

558
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,660
What happened here? 
Did you get hurt?

559
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,350
I bumped into a table.

560
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,660
My goodness.

561
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,750
You should be careful.

562
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,510
What was the rush?

563
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,480
Are you hurting anywhere else?

564
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,890
Gosh.

565
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,110
I'm fine. Come on.

566
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,420
Be careful.

567
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,000
All right.

568
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,900
Looks good.

569
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,400
Okay.

570
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,930
- I'll pour it for you.
- Okay.

571
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,500
All right.

572
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Cheers.

573
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,930
I should always drink 
with you, Mom.

574
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,970
It tastes great, huh?

575
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,610
I feel the same way.

576
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,020
Chae Woon.

577
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,350
Yeah?

578
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,020
Well...

579
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,110
shall we...

580
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,930
try looking for...

581
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,080
your birth mother?

582
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,490
Why, all of a sudden?

583
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,230
Mom, you're still upset 
about last time, huh?

584
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,220
Because I was searching
 for my birth mom...

585
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,540
and some ahjumma came 
to our house and all.

586
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,570
No.

587
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:33,180
I didn't feel sad then at all.

588
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,020
Chae Woon.

589
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,900
All this time, you were...

590
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,870
considerate of me,

591
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,090
so you didn't...

592
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,330
look for her properly.

593
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,030
If we search for her 
more aggressively,

594
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,970
I wonder if you'd be able
 to meet your birth mom.

595
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Gosh, see?

596
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,970
You're still upset.

597
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,100
You sure know how to hold 
a grudge, Ms. Soon Jung.

598
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,870
It's not like that.

599
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,330
Gosh.

600
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,510
Mom.

601
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,680
When I was looking for
 my birth parents,

602
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,030
it was purely out of curiosity.

603
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,540
 Just a simple curiosity wondering
 what my birth parents are like. 

604
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,050
 For real. 

605
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,120
 But I made up my mind. 

606
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,090
From now on, I'll never...

607
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,350
search for my birth 
parents ever again.

608
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,830
Even if they come here first

609
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,190
and plead and beg to see me,

610
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,610
I'll never meet them.

611
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,680
What do you mean 
never meet them?

612
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,920
If they were to come all the way here?

613
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,090
There's no way that would happen.

614
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,560
And...

615
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,900
you're the only mom for me.

616
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,570
You know that.

617
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,380
For real. It's the truth.

618
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,280
But still...

619
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,890
your birth mom might 
be a really remarkable

620
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,190
and a wonderful person.

621
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,540
There is only one person...

622
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,380
who is truly remarkable and

623
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,880
wonderful in this world.

624
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,110
Lee Soon Jung mom.

625
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,910
So don't say stuff like this again.

626
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,200
If you say this again, I'll get mad.

627
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,800
Aigoo.

628
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,510
My mom...

629
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,550
Because of Lee Hae Deun
 and Lee Man Jung,

630
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,170
you got hurt a lot today.

631
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,510
You're afraid that they
 put a huge load on me.

632
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,130
I'm okay, Mom.

633
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,220
This isn't the first time.

634
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,880
Your oldest daughter is totally fine.

635
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,290
Do you understand?

636
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,150
 I should tell her. 

637
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,360
 Tell her, Lee Soon Jung. 

638
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,050
 Tell her. 

639
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,760
I love you, Mom.

640
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
I love you the most in this world.

641
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,400
Me, too.

642
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,600
I love you so much, my Chae Woon.

643
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,840
I love you the most in this world.

644
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,130
 I'm sorry. 

645
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,350
 I'm really sorry. 

646
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,620
Bit Chae Woon isn't 
her birth daughter?

647
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
Wait a minute.

648
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,270
Seo Ah isn't her birth 
daughter, either.

649
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,810
 

650
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,470
Geez...

651
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,520
Why are they so expensive?

652
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,820
 
 - Auntie, where are you?
- Auntie, where are you? 

653
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,100
Why are they texting
 me simultaneously?

654
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,000
 

655
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,370
 I'll be sleeping in a hotel. 
Don't call me. 

656
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,120
 
 - Okay.
- Okay. 

657
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,510
They reply so quickly.

658
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,940
 

659
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,980
There are no more texts.

660
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,430
Right. I wouldn't, either.

661
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,690
So don't worry about me.

662
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,710
Everyone relax...

663
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,870
and have a good life.

664
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,240
Kim Hwak Se...

665
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,150
What do you mean you 
didn't say anything?

666
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,400
I know you told on me.

667
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,150
That traitor.

668
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,310
I'll take revenge.

669
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,730
Wow!

670
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:57,170
I'll get to sleep like
 I should be starting tonight.

671
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,070
I'm so happy.

672
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,910
Very, very happy.

673
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,500
Wow, it's so weird.

674
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,080
Why can't I fall asleep?

675
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,990
Is it because it's too quiet?

676
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,300
Why? What's up?

677
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,290
You snore too loud! 
I can't sleep at all!

678
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,060
Ahjumma, we'll gather 
some money for you.

679
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,730
Can you sleep elsewhere?

680
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,060
Yes, please. Go somewhere else.

681
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,200
I can't sleep at all!

682
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,420
You're too much.

683
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,890
Wait a minute.

684
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,550
Did you get kicked out from 
home over snoring?

685
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,050
Seriously. Gosh, this is so annoying!

686
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,620
What kind of situation is this?

687
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,330
I paid to stay here!

688
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,830
- Just go to a motel.
- I'm sleeping! Are you guys thugs?

689
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,800
 Gosh, unbelievable. 

690
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,010
 - This is terrible. 
- Owner!

691
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,810
Seriously.

692
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,840
They sent me to a scary room.

693
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
Where should I sleep?

694
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,490
I'm scared of the dark.

695
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,660
I'll leave this on.

696
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,400
My gosh.

697
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,000
Gosh, that Man Jung...

698
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,200
Gosh, I'm so upset.

699
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,970
 You're really a terrible person. 

700
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,060
 You don't reflect 
on your wrongdoing. 

701
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,130
 You don't have a conscience. 

702
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,990
 If you feel it's so unfair, 
bring your proof. 

703
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,190
 Don't act like a victim. 

704
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,100
 Yup. I'll bring you a proof. 

705
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,240
 Oppa, I told you, right? 

706
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,930
 The girl who used to bully 
me in middle school 

707
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,470
 started working at our company. 

708
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,200
As expected, Headbutt has
 some incredible power.

709
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,000
Kapow!

710
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,870
Good morning.

711
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,540
Good morning.

712
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,400
Go ahead. I'm finished.

713
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,020
No, it's okay. I'm here to
 get some morning air.

714
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,200
Nice.

715
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,450
- Kapow!
- Geez. Scare me.

716
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,290
I guess you have so much energy 
surging out of you this morning?

717
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,050
Well, it's not really surging.

718
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,010
But I must try even if 
I have to force it.

719
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,720
I have to settle a score.

720
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,100
Who? Someone at work?

721
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,090
Well, there is one person at work.

722
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,890
Is something the matter 
with your coworker?

723
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,920
Kapow!

724
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,610
- Hook!
- Geez, scare me.

725
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,290
Geez, go over there.

726
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,760
Okay, I have to straighten 
some things out.

727
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,620
I'll go inside first.

728
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,940
Use these.

729
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,500
Shoot, shoot! Kapow!

730
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,100
Geez.

731
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,600
Seo Ah is in trouble.

732
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,150
Hey.

733
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,620
What?

734
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,670
Well, I think violence is not a 
good way to resolve issues.

735
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,420
Even though you may hold
 a grudge from the past,

736
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,760
first, talk it out calmly
 and resolve it smoothly.

737
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,440
What are you talking about?

738
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,280
Today...

739
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,560
you said you have to settle a score?

740
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,180
Do you think I'll hit her 
or something?

741
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,160
A headbutt?

742
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,750
That's right. I should
 resolve things smoothly.

743
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,060
I'll take your advice.

744
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,340
I don't know if it will 
work out that way.

745
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,880
Lee Hae Deun, wake up. 
Gather around.

746
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,070
Wait. Wait...

747
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,140
Geez, this is bad.

748
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,870
- Park So Mi?
- Park So Mi?

749
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,170
Yeah.

750
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,040
How would we find your
 middle school classmate?

751
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,070
Well, technically, 
she's not my classmate.

752
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,240
Since I dropped out.

753
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,630
But still, you guys went 
to the same school I did.

754
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,900
Some friends you may know.

755
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,200
You can find her if you look through
 your friends' girlfriends and whatnot.

756
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,300
My deadline is 
by the end of the day.

757
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,630
How can we find her today?
 It's not like we do nothing.

758
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,010
Mainly, you traitor, Lee Hae Deun.

759
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,080
Find her as you reflect on 
your wrongdoing. Got that?

760
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,620
- I got it.
 - Have some breakfast! 

761
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,880
Yes, Mom!

762
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,010
Let's go eat.

763
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,230
Noona.

764
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,570
Why are you looking
 for that Park So Mi?

765
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,110
I have to clear up something.

766
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,710
 I'll find Park So Mi who was close
 to Jang Seo Ah back in school, 

767
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,480
 and I'll prove it. 

768
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,330
 That I didn't bully Seo Ah. 

769
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,010
Unni!

770
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,400
Something's up, huh?

771
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,950
Why?

772
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,640
Park So Mi.

773
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,740
She framed you in middle school 
saying you hit someone.

774
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:51,010
With that Jang something girl.

775
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,070
Did you know about that?

776
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,280
You couldn't hide that 
even if you tried.

777
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,800
It was a huge incident in our family.

778
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,250
Why? Are they
 bothering you again?

779
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,000
No. Just find her.

780
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,120
Shut the mouth in front of Mom.

781
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,900
I'm off.

782
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,410
Then can I continue
 with my skincare?

783
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,710
Geez.

784
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,050
Do whatever you want.

785
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,490
Gosh, seriously.

786
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,240
Thanks, Unni!

787
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,410
Gosh, she never tells me anything.

788
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,550
She carries all the heavy load.

789
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,740
Park So Mi. I'll find you for sure.

790
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,560
 Someone named Park So Mi. 

791
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,400
 27th class of Jaeil Middle School. 

792
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,010
 Whoa, your first love? 

793
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,130
 No, she's not. I just
 have to find her. 

794
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,160
You knew about that, too?

795
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,460
When Unni was framed 
unfairly in middle school?

796
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,420
Of course, I knew.

797
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,320
But since Noona and Mom 
were so hush-hush about it,

798
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,480
I just pretended not to know.

799
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,110
Geez, you know-it-all.

800
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,730
Geez, my gosh.

801
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,460
In any case, I should help
 out Chae Woon noona.

802
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,200
So weird.

803
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,920
This strange feeling like 
someone is following me.

804
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,190
Yes, yes, yes.

805
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,010
I'll be right there. Okay.

806
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,280
♫  It's not just once or twice  ♫

807
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,710
♫  Whenever I see you  ♫

808
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:53,880
♫  I keep becoming speechless  ♫

809
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,600
Did you follow me?

810
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,590
Why?

811
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,290
You know why.

812
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,420
I don't know.

813
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,620
I clearly told you not to 
disappear from me.

814
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,420
- Because...
- No, whatever! I didn't hear anything.

815
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,430
♫  I'll give it to you wrapped
 in my two hands  ♫

816
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,070
♫  I love you as much as a red rose  ♫

817
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,410
What do you mean 
you didn't hear me?

818
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,870
You heard me saying I like you.

819
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,260
No, I didn't hear that at all...

820
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,750
- And speak casually. We're classmates.
- No!

821
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,080
We're not classmates.

822
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,710
So...

823
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,970
actually...

824
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,920
 I'm a high school graduate. 

825
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,340
Actually, I'm not 
a Seohan University student.

826
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,240
I mean, I'm not a university student.

827
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,550
I just work for a delivery company.

828
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,750
But I wasn't trying to
 scam you or anything.

829
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,140
Due to my circumstances...

830
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,580
I don't want to tell you 
all that. Anyway...

831
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,670
Why are you talking so much?

832
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,880
So what I'm saying is...

833
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,200
I know.

834
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,660
Know what?

835
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,560
I know you're a fake 
university student.

836
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,620
So, let's...

837
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,510
Oh, my gosh!

838
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,380
 I found out at that moment. 

839
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,730
Hey! What's wrong?

840
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,300
 When you're extremely embarrassed, 

841
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,150
Are you okay?

842
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,830
 you can faint. 

843
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,180
Oh, my gosh!

844
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,400
My gosh!

845
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,450
What should I do? Put him down?

846
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,610
In this style,

847
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,610
there are five color concepts.

848
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:40,900
 

849
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,280
Thank you.

850
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,080
Please submit a report.

851
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,890
Then...

852
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:59,400
you saying it's not easy to 
find out who made that call?

853
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,350
I understand.

854
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:07,820
Still, please continue to look into it.

855
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,420
  Your biological daughter,
 Park Seo Yeon.  

856
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,160
  She's not dead.  

857
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,380
  She's alive.  

858
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,790
Seo Yeon's picture.

859
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,370
Where did it go?

860
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,550
CEO, for the lay apparel...

861
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,440
Oh, yeah.

862
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,600
Are you looking for something?

863
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,900
Shouldn't you knock before
 you come in, Director Jang?

864
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,200
I'm sorry. I was in a rush.

865
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,240
What about lay apparel?

866
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,870
Well, that is...

867
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,070
I think she was looking for this.

868
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,270
Who is this kid?

869
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,100
Come in.

870
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,400
Did you look into it?

871
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,970
There is no other 
assignment that the

872
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,900
CEO instructed to a different staff 
without my knowledge.

873
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,050
Really?

874
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,680
CEO just left.

875
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,260
I know. She has a meeting outside.

876
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,350
But...

877
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,200
Mr. Kim didn't drive her. 
She drove herself.

878
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,600
Personally?

879
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,060
 I'm sure of it. 

880
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,270
 It's his doing. 

881
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,890
 He did something. 

882
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,910
 Park Pil Hong. 

883
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:28,720
 Mr. Park Pil Hong refused to see you. 

884
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,580
 He doesn't want to see you, 
Ms. Kim Jung Won. 

885
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,800
Jung Won came to see me?

886
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:49,590
Jung Won, who has never 
shown her face around here.

887
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:54,070
What is that a**hole 
doing on that job?

888
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,440
 Yes, Hyungnim! 

889
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,900
Welcome.

890
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,910
Is that from here?

891
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,680
Yes.

892
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,380
Where is that?

893
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,700
It's over there. Come follow me.

894
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,540
Here. It's this one.

895
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,250
Including this. Try it on.

896
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,560
 Unni, I looked into it. 

897
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,100
 My classmates don't 
know Park So Mi. 

898
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,140
 I asked friends of friends 
from middle school. 

899
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,310
 Got it. 

900
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,900
"Got it." That's it.

901
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,790
Someone clean that up.

902
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,390
Yes, I'll do it.

903
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,580
Jae Hee.

904
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,400
This is hard.

905
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,300
Geez, I'm sore since I haven't
 worked out in a while.

906
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,840
Gosh, you're so young,
 yet so stiff. You're no good.

907
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,860
Mom, when did you do this?

908
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,440
You're pretty good.

909
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,930
Every now and then.

910
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,190
You heard from Jung Won
 about my divorce, right?

911
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,610
You haven't heard?

912
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,890
By chance...

913
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,010
Nah, right?

914
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,480
It's true.

915
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,310
I'll divorce your father.

916
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,780
Mom.

917
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,970
You always said so.

918
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,910
Not to live under your father's control

919
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,720
and live my own life.

920
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,990
But still, that's not right. 
How can you get a divorce?

921
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,500
I guess you can't help it, huh? 
Since you're your father's son?

922
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,910
Well, I guess it's possible.

923
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,340
But still, accept it.

924
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,500
I won't change my mind.

925
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,360
 

926
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:46,120
Jung Min Jae.

927
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,550
You weren't playing around?

928
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,590
You really meant it?

929
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,230
 Did you not understand what
 I said? Let's get divorced.  

930
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,760
 A divorce! 

931
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,290
S***!

932
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,320
President.

933
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,700
What is it?

934
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,960
Your son is in the lobby.

935
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,110
You weren't answering his call, so
he called the secretary's office.

936
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,530
Is that so?

937
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,920
I blocked his number.
 Of course, I wouldn't answer.

938
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Pardon?

939
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,140
It's nothing.

940
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,960
I'm busy. Send him home.

941
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,610
He said it's urgent...

942
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,710
Now, she's using her son?

943
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,820
Give me a freaking break!

944
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,590
I can't meet him?

945
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,090
President is in his office, right?

946
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,390
Jae Hee.

947
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,950
Uncle.

948
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:56,790
A divorce?

949
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,300
Noona?

950
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,680
Yes.

951
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,570
I guess their situation is 
more serious than I thought.

952
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,410
If I could,

953
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,870
I'd let her get divorced.

954
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,500
But at this stage of life...

955
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,280
She was always home.

956
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,850
I'm worried as to how
 she'll live alone.

957
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,620
I'll try hard, too...

958
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,560
but please do something, Uncle.

959
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,340
Meet Mom and persuade 
Father, too. Please?

960
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,810
Uncle!

961
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,300
Huh?

962
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,530
Okay. Yeah.

963
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,840
I should.

964
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,590
What was that?

965
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,250
I think Uncle has something
 else up his sleeve.

966
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,640
Wait.

967
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,250
Noona is getting a divorce?

968
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,040
Then...

969
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,740
as for this company...

970
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,320
This is a big chance for me?

971
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,930
Oh, yeah!

972
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,000
Oh, yeah!

973
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,190
Oh, yeah!

974
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,730
Yay!

975
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,620
Yay, yay!

976
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,300
 

977
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,500
 

978
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,350
 

979
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,530
 Ms. Jung Min Jae, 
you have a delivery. 

980
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,080
I knew it.

981
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,880
Attorney.

982
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,090
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

983
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:07,270
About the international
 patent rights.

984
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,690
I'm a different attorney.

985
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:10,930
Excuse me?

986
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:13,960
I'm Jung Min Jae's attorney.

987
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,450
What about my wife?

988
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,970
Is something the matter?

989
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:20,850
Jung Min Jae filed a divorce case.

990
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:23,020
What?

991
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,260
Whoa...

992
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,740
I went there, too. I'm exhausted.

993
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,610
- Me, too.
- I hear you.

994
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,100
Go ahead.

995
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,220
Yeah.

996
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,150
 Unni, breaking news. 

997
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,640
A photo with Park So Mi

998
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,670
posted on my friend's sister's SNS.

999
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,030
I guess she's in a cafe
 in Hannamdong.

1000
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,400
Really?

1001
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,100
Unni, can you go right now?

1002
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,360
Should I go?

1003
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,650
Hello? Unni.

1004
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,080
Geez.

1005
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,320
My gosh. She must catch her.

1006
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,300
Wait, catch who?

1007
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,900
Mom.

1008
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,650
Mom. Mom!

1009
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,400
I mean...

1010
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,900
You should've told me 
about this sooner.

1011
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,770
Mom, it's nothing.
 It's really nothing.

1012
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:16,610
Hurry up and grab a taxi.

1013
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,200
Are you going 
somewhere, Ms. Lee?

1014
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,320
Mr. Woo!

1015
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,820
Taxi!

1016
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,010
Wait! Taxi!

1017
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,610
Oh, my.

1018
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,330
Is something wrong?

1019
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,230
- Bit Chae Woon.
- CEO.

1020
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:06,240
Are you in a rush? 
Do you want a ride?

1021
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,200
No, it's okay.

1022
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,250
Get in. Hurry.

1023
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,790
You should be careful.

1024
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,100
Where are you headed?

1025
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,050
To Hannamdong.

1026
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,730
- Mr. Kim, you heard, right?
- Yes.

1027
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,170
Are you always so clumsy?

1028
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,790
Yes, a bit.

1029
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,000
How is your leg? You bumped it.

1030
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,870
I'm fine. I have strong bones.

1031
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,800
Mr. Woo, I'm sorry.

1032
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,290
We're in a rush.

1033
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,710
It's okay.

1034
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,400
- Mom.
- Huh?

1035
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:10,290
Oh, my.

1036
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,450
My gosh...

1037
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,380
We're here.

1038
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,140
Okay. Thank you.

1039
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,890
See you tomorrow.

1040
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,900
I'll get going. Thank you, CEO.

1041
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,450
Who are you?

1042
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,160
You know me, right, Park So Mi?

1043
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,660
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

1044
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,260
I dropped out of Jaeil Middle School.

1045
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,990
I don't know.

1046
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,950
You know me.

1047
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,410
Being framed?

1048
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,350
What do you mean I framed you?

1049
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,510
You guys framed me 
saying I bullied Seo Ah.

1050
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,630
So Mi.

1051
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,800
I'm not trying to blame you.

1052
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,200
You just have to testify
 to what happened then.

1053
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,610
Say that I didn't bully Seo Ah.

1054
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,680
You just have to say that.

1055
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,890
I don't remember such an incident.

1056
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,890
You felt bad about it, too.

1057
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:37,280
That's why you sent me an email
 saying you were sorry at one point.

1058
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,240
Please, So Mi.

1059
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,600
Your debt of regrets.

1060
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,700
You can repay me now.

1061
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,020
I... I must reveal the truth
 about the incident.

1062
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:49,990
What are you doing?

1063
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:52,020
What are you talking about 
coming to me out of the blue?

1064
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,520
Aren't you...

1065
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,880
Hello.

1066
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,970
You're Seo Ah's friend, right?

1067
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,250
I'm busy.

1068
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,900
Hey, Park So Mi.

1069
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,670
- Park So Mi!
- Bit Chae Woon!

1070
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:19,240
Bit Chae Woon, you're so tenacious.

1071
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,690
When we said we'd forgive you, 
you should let it go.

1072
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:25,120
Why are you trying to dig into this?

1073
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,640
And why did you come 
looking for Seo Ah's friend?

1074
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,090
Don't you know that 
your actions like these

1075
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,560
are hurting my Seo Ah?

1076
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:40,810
It's not something 
I should keep quiet about.

1077
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,670
It's not something
 I should be forgiven for.

1078
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:51,270
When you dropped out of school,

1079
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:55,270
you said you regretted it because
 it felt like you ran away.

1080
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,140
I understand.

1081
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,070
But what can you do about it now?

1082
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,720
You should overcome it by yourself.

1083
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,540
Yes.

1084
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,180
I'm extremely regretful.

1085
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,070
But what bothers me 
more than that

1086
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,900
is that you misunderstood me.

1087
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,780
Why?

1088
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,260
It's your problem.

1089
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,940
Why should I matter?

1090
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,610
I know.

1091
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,300
But that's how it is.

1092
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,330
I don't know why, either.

1093
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,870
Hae Deun, you know 
what they look like, right?

1094
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,230
Where?

1095
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,980
They're not here.

1096
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,580
Look carefully.

1097
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,720
I think they already met.

1098
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,040
My gosh.

1099
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,720
These girls...

1100
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,280
Just a moment. 
Stay here for a moment.

1101
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,100
What?

1102
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,100
Even my mom?

1103
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,600
What's going on here?

1104
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,290
I don't know what's going on, either.

1105
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,980
What's with Bit Chae Woon?

1106
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:35,940
Why is she trying to dig
 into us for framing her?

1107
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,490
Who are you?

1108
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,550
Excuse me.

1109
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,370
Who is it now?

1110
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,560
- Who is it?
- Please talk to me for a moment.

1111
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,040
 Who are you? 

1112
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,950
 Are you Bit Chae Woon's
 older brother? 

1113
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,800
Bit Chae Woon's older brother?

1114
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:58,250
Did she have an older brother?

1115
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,390
- Come with me for a moment...
- Whatever! Leave me alone!

1116
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,740
- It will just be a moment.
- What the heck?

1117
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,400
Please talk to me for a moment.
 

1118
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,500
Please talk to me for a moment...

1119
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,280
Myeongseong Middle School.

1120
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:20,170
 Is there something unfair 
about what happened? 

1121
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,080
Bye now.

1122
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,440
Hi, Ms. Goo.

1123
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,200
Yeah, as for that...

1124
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:45,070
at tomorrow's meeting...

1125
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,430
Unni!

1126
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:52,980
Chae Woon? Where?

1127
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,990
- Over there! Unni!
- Chae...

1128
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,190
Hey.

1129
01:06:58,190 --> 01:06:59,750
Why are you here?

1130
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,190
I was worried about you. 
So, what happened?

1131
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:03,790
You wouldn't answer the phone.

1132
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,200
Mom.

1133
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,150
- Why bring Mom?
- Let's go.

1134
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,900
Mom.

1135
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,700
Hold on.

1136
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,430
 Is it Bit Chae Woon's mom? 

1137
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,170
- You're hurting me.
- Mom.

1138
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,590
Let's hurry.

1139
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,950
- Mom, you're hurting me.
- Mom, what's wrong?

1140
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:44,010
 I know I shouldn't do this. 

1141
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,700
 But not yet... 

1142
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,660
 But I can't let you go yet, Chae Woon. 

1143
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,070
 Not yet. 

1144
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,240
- Let's go!
- Mom!

1145
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:59,000
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1146
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:07,130
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1147
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:13,450
♫  You're drawn to each 
other like the magnets  ♫

1148
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:19,960
♫  You part ways leaving
 a hole in your heart  ♫

1149
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,680
 

1150
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,540
 A secret. 

1151
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,730
 Jinx! 

1152
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,670
 Could we be real siblings? 

1153
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:30,390
 Did I tell you that we
 were adopted, too? 

1154
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,670
 I don't think you did. 

1155
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,670
 Why did you marry Mom if 
you were going to do this? 

1156
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:37,130
 Do you think I married her 
because I wanted to? 

1157
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,440
 I'll make sure I never 
come back to this house. 

1158
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,990
 Be healthy. 

1159
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:42,790
 Abandonment of inheritance rights. 

1160
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,970
 - So Mi.
- Bit Chae Woon. 

1161
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:47,290
 How can you think of

 Did you come to tell 
everything to my kids? 

1163
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,910
 I want to clear everything
 and be blameless. 

1164
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,580
 Will you help me?
