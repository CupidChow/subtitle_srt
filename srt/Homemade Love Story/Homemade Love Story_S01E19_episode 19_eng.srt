1
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,730
Go home with me.

2
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,660
My baby...

3
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,240
Let's go home.

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,380
Go home with me.

5
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,350
- CEO!
- Young Lady!

6
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,540
CEO...

7
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,820
Oh, my!

8
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,860
Aigoo, come.

9
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,800
Unni! The umbrella.

10
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,680
 Gosh, it's pouring. 

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,180
Why are you getting wet?

12
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,470
Let's go inside.

13
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,730
You're all wet...

14
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,900
No, I should go.

15
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,780
I'm sorry for showing up
 all of a sudden.

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,990
Bit Chae Woon...

17
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,340
I just thought of you out of the blue.

18
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,680
Young Lady.

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,530
Chae Woon...

20
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,210
Wait, I'll drive you home.

21
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,590
I have my car over there.

22
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,310
Oh, okay...

23
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,050
Here.

24
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,350
Thanks.

25
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,760
Don't get wet, Mom.

26
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,770
Unni, the umbrella.

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,970
- Mom, you'll catch a cold. Come.
- Yeah, go in.

28
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,870
- Go in, Mom.
- Let's go inside.

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,790
- Mom.
- Mom, let's go in.

30
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,350
Where is your car?

31
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,980
I'll call a taxi.

32
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,100
 

33
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,380
- Mom.
- Hae Deun!

34
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,450
Let her be.

35
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,940
Come here.

36
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,520
Leave your mom alone.

37
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,880
CEO was a bit strange, huh?

38
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,160
Did she have a drink?

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,080
I guess she missed her daughter.

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,110
Even though she knows 
she shouldn't...

41
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,080
her feet automatically...

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,900
lead her this way.

43
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,430
Whoa, psychological analysis.

44
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,250
Gosh, it got cold.

45
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,750
CEO...

46
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,090
must want to take 
Chae Woon noona home.

47
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,070
Right, Auntie? Right, Noona?

48
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,840
Is that something she can do
 just because she wants to?

49
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,690
Unni told us she'd never go.

50
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,310
What do you think you 
would've done?

51
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,030
She'd go right away.

52
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,290
Auntie!

53
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,920
That's not true.

54
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,360
Hae Deun wouldn't leave
 because of me.

55
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,950
 Let's go... 

56
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,750
 Go home with me. 

57
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,610
 My baby... 

58
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,650
Yes...

59
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,980
I should let her go.

60
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,390
I should let her go.

61
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,560
No matter Chae Woon
 says she won't go...

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,920
I should let her go even
 if she says no.

63
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,530
I should let my Chae Woon go...

64
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,390
I should let Chae Woon go...

65
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,730
Do you have any illnesses?

66
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,870
No, I don't.

67
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,790
I'm sorry about last time.

68
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,780
I was too rude.

69
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,270
No.

70
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,820
No.

71
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,340
I'll hold it.

72
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,370
I'm sorry...

73
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,860
for showing up suddenly.

74
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,910
♫  I wish it'd be like that now  ♫

75

Dummy!

Didn't you know how stupid I am?

98
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,800
Geez, anyway...

99
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,430
James and Jae Hee are late.

100
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,290
What did they say earlier 
when they called?

101
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,900
He said that James ahjussi 
would go to his therapy

102
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,760
and take a drive.

103
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
I'll call him again.

104
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,280
Anyway, Jae Hee is...

105
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,670
so good to S-jussi. 
It doesn't suit him.

106
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,320
What's "S-jussi"?

107
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,410
Jame ahjussi. I'll just call him 
S-jussi from now on.

108
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,140
Then for Hwak Se ahjussi, 
you're Se-jussi.

109
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,530
No, I'm not.

110
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm Hwak-ppa.

111
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,000
Hwak Se oppa!

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,350
- Yeah, I'm an oppa.
 - The customer is not... 

113
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,150
 answering the phone. 

114
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,320
Jae Hee hyung isn't answering.

115
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,390
Really?

116
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,100
How come Na Ro oppa
 isn't home yet?

117
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,350
He said he was closeby.

118
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,340
I know.

119
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,370
He said he was closeby, 
so put some cheese on his.

120
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,950
The cheese must be 
hardened by now.

121
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,420
Geez.

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,110
A**hole.

123
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,510
You're pretty gutsy. 
Going deep into the fish tank.

124
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,940
That's my charm. You know that.

125
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,430
Right.

126
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,140
It's your charm.

127
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,650
But this is wrong.

128
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,430
How dare you barge into my territory

129
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,770
and coiled up like a snake?

130
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,180
That's not it, Hyungnim.

131
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,880
I happened to find a room to rent...

132
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,220
and it turned out that way.

133
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,850
This is your plan.

134
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,700
Move into Samgwang Villa 
and my daughter Seo Yeon...

135
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,360
No, it's Bit Chae Woon now.

136
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,140
You want to entice her 
since you look all right.

137
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,130
And you'll become Kim Jung Won's
 son-in-law, ta-da.

138
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,270
You want to make that entrance 
and live a good life. Right?

139
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,620
Geez, all he has left is
 his quick wit.

140
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,190
Punk, how dare you want
 to be my son-in-law?

141
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,450
Son-in-law?

142
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,130
Ouch...

143
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,220
Did anyone say they'd acknowledge 
you as Bit Chae Woon's father?

144
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,500
Do you think CEO Kim Jung Won 
will sit back, Hyungnim?

145
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,520
I guess you don't get it since 
you've been put away for so long.

146
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,950
The situation isn't
 like that right now.

147
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,670
In any case.

148
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,420
Get lost within the next 24 hours.

149
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,350
If you don't pack up and move out
 of Samgwang Villa tomorrow,

150
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,040
I'll just...

151
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,650
Today, I just tickled you a little bit.

152
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,010
Just know that.

153
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,440
Mom.

154
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,100
Did she go home okay?

155
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,670
Yeah.

156
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,350
I grabbed a taxi for her.

157
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,860
You did well.

158
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,770
CEO...

159
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,720
must've missed you a lot.

160
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,780
Mom.

161
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,790
I'm sorry for throwing a fit earlier.

162
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,130
Are you sorry?

163
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,210
Aigoo, you're all wet.

164
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,080
But...

165
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,910
don't iron all those things again.

166
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,460
I get so scared that 
you might tell me to go.

167
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,720
I won't.

168
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,830
Go wash up and go to bed.

169
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,340
Okay. Rest.

170
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,680
Mom...

171
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,950
do you know an ahjumma 
named Byun Mi Ja?

172
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,350
Byun Mi Ja?

173
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,840
Who is that?

174
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,350
Yeah...

175
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,180
She's the sister of one of the
 engineers I work with at the site.

176
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,370
She said she used to 
be your neighbor.

177
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,890
So I was wondering if you knew her.

178
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,100
Get some rest.

179
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,830
Okay. Go rest.

180
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,400
Byun Mi Ja?

181
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,030
She said they were close.

182
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,850
Mom doesn't know her?

183
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,820
Hey, you're driving me crazy. 
Sit down.

184
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,850
I can't sit still.

185
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,300
- Unni!
- Noona.

186
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,360
Why?

187
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,080
Is something wrong?

188
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,880
No.

189
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,050
I thought you'd just
 leave with the CEO.

190
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,150
Hey. Like this?

191
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,310
In my slippers?

192
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,340
No, when I saw you follow the CEO...

193
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,810
I felt like you were leaving 
for good like that.

194
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,930
Hey.

195
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,430
Idiots.

196
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,220
I told you that I'd never leave.

197
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,230
But still...

198
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,350
since she's your birth mom...

199
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,340
We don't know how that feels.

200
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,740
If she's your birth mom, 
wouldn't it feel like

201
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,370
being pulled by a magnet, 
and shouldn't you leave?

202
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,120
Aigoo, aigoo!

203
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,340
Hey. What do you mean
 you don't know?

204
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,580
My mom is right over there.

205
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,930
When Mom goes somewhere,

206
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,000
do you guys feel like
 going like magnets?

207
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,790
Why overreact?

208
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,620
Ra Hoon, go upstairs.

209
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,790
Goodnight.

210
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,150
Clean up your things.

211
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,530
Okay.

212
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,750
What's with you, Lee Ra Hoon?

213
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,350
Don't disappear, Chae Woon noona.

214
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,350
Go.

215
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,950
I'm going.

216
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,950
- Wash your feet!
- Okay.

217
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,610
Let's clean up.

218
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,190
Unni, don't go anywhere.

219
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,050
Hey, just finished up cleaning.

220
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,460
These clothes are all yours.

221
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,790
Thanks.

222
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,100
Mom.

223
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,640
Where did you go?

224
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,120
Mr. Kim said he dropped 
you off somewhere.

225
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,760
I couldn't reach you.

226
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,710
Where did you get
 rained on like this?

227
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,740
What happened?

228
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,210
You'll catch a cold.

229
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,040
Start a bath for me.

230
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,420
Yes, CEO.

231
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,830
Mom.

232
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,710
Did you go and meet 
Bit Chae Woon?

233
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,120
Did you?

234
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,090
Seo Ah.

235
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,450
Yes?

236
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,020
 Who is Lee Bit Chae Woon? 

237
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,060
 Who is it? 

238
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,250
 It's her. 

239
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,670
 Lee Bit Chae Woon... 

240
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,150
 It's her, Mom. 

241
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,330
 The girl who bullied me in middle
 school and quit school. 

242
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,760
 It's her. 

243
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,410
 I thought you'd leave. 

244
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,200
 I thought you'd leave since
 you're not my real mom. 

245
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,480
No.

246
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,700
Mom.

247
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,470
Should I ask Dr. Lee to come over?

248
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,900
I think you have a fever.

249
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,200
What do I do...

250
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,810
No, I'm okay.

251
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,680
I want to be alone.

252
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,150
Mom...

253
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,370
 - I'll do it.
- Over here. 

254
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,650
 Gosh. 

255
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,840
Bit Chae Woon...

256
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,830
She's taking everyone from me.

257
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,950
She's...

258
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,400
taking everyone from me.

259
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,570
Red...

260
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,540
All right. Let me see...

261
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,060
 
 Oppa, when are you 
coming back to Korea? 

262
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,710
 I miss you so much. 

263
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,670
Gosh, Seo Ah. Why does
 she keep doing this?

264
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,260
Are things not working
 out with Woo Jae Hee?

265
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,220
Then she should just give up. 
Aigoo, seriously.

266
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,190
Whatever.

267
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,970
 

268
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,890
Hello?

269
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,990
What, hello?

270
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,050
You were waiting for my call, huh?

271
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,330
I wasn't.

272
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,980
Geez.

273
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,390
You were staring at my number,

274
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,030
 and you were wondering
 if you should call or not. 

275
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,910
Where are you right now?

276
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,500
I'm out with James to 
get some fresh air.

277
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,520
 It was cold and rainy today. 

278
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,210
 Get fresh air? 

279
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,800
Well, so...

280
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,620
The oldest daughter?

281
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,590
I'll talk to you at home.

282
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,630
Bye.

283
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,450
Wait...

284
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,040
What the heck?

285
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,490
So...

286
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,310
are you feeling better?

287
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,060
Yeah.

288
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,470
Maybe it's the good IV.

289
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,300
I feel better now.

290
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,580
Do you know how scared I was?

291
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,750
I'm sorry, Yoo Jae Hee.

292
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,920
It's okay.

293
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,080
 Actually, it was my fault. 

294
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,550
 - Hang tight.
 - What?

295
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,680
 Sorry, Mom! 

296
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,670
That ahjussi I saw when
 I went there with Seo Ah...

297
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,770
That was Jae Hee's dad.

298
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,000
 Our competitors are developing
 many products these days. 

299
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,420
 Mom, what? It's raining. 

300
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,250
Woo Jae Hee, this guy...

301
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,160
Just because I'm 
seeing a therapist,

302
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,270
he's hiding something
 from me. I'm sure.

303
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,550
If I pester him,

304
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,600
he'll be busy trying to 
sneak out of it.

305
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,250
That slippery Woo Jae Hee.

306
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,860
But you're still my son, man.

307
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,630
You got that, punk?

308
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,430
What could it be?

309
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,220
This uneasy feeling.

310
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,150
Me, too.

311
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,330
I feel very uneasy about something.

312
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,270
It's cold. Button up.

313
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,780
♫  It's a slap, slap, slap  ♫

314
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,850
♫  No, you're the one  ♫

315
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,050
Geez...

316
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,400
Why aren't Jae Hee and 
James home yet?

317
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,040
Geez...

318
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,440
Hey!

319
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,750
I'm not scared.

320
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,890
Koala...

321
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,590
Why isn't he home yet?

322
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,700
Gosh.

323
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,060
This makes me look bad.

324
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,660
Na Ro.

325
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,190
What happened?

326
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,840
I ran into a friend on my way home,

327
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
and we went to ride bikes.

328
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,100
I fell.

329
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,660
You should go to the hospital.

330
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,210
It's okay.

331
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,900
Goodnight, Bit Chae Woon.

332
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,750
Gosh.

333
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,650
Ow...

334
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,930
Yes.

335
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,080
I brought some medicine.

336
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,150
Thanks.

337
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,730
I'll get it.

338
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,080
I'll get it.

339
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,080
Sit down over here.

340
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,940
Ow...

341
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,220
This isn't from falling.

342
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,070
You got beat up.

343
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,100
Did you get into a fight?

344
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,640
No.

345
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,800
Give me your hand.

346
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,410
I'll do it.

347
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,390
You can't move that hand.

348
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,680
I'll just do this hand.

349
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,880
Let me see.

350
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,720
I didn't touch yet.

351
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,480
I see...

352
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,110
Sorry.

353
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,700
Yoo Jae Hee.

354
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,800
You went through a lot
 today because of me.

355
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,410
Yes, I sure did.

356
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,090
 Come on. 

357
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,190
Ouch, be gentle. Be gentle.

358
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,240
- I'm being gentle.
- What are you doing?

359
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,180
What are you two doing? 
So close together!

360
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,730
Cunning Penguin.

361
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,470
Aigoo.

362
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,090
He got hurt. See, there's 
the emergency kit.

363
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,770
I'm treating him.

364
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,290
Cunning Penguin, 
how did this happen?

365
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,290
I fell. I'm okay.

366
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,490
Fall? Right...

367
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,420
You got beat up somewhere.

368
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,280
Right?

369
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,600
It looks that way, huh?

370
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,550
Did you take medicine?

371
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,580
No. I'll be fine if I put this on.

372
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,780
I got some medicine today.

373
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,070
- I'll share it with you.
- Geez.

374
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,450
You can't share medicine like that.
 You have different symptoms.

375
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,370
I see.

376
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,230
What medicine?

377
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,580
Were you at a hospital?

378
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,430
Are you very ill?

379
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,660
Well...

380
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,230
 He's such a party-pooper. 

381
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,080
You're really okay, right?

382
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,290
Yes.

383
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,560
I feel better thanks to
 expensive medicine.

384
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,620
Thanks, Yoo Jae Hee.

385
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,760
What's wrong?

386
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,440
 You'll be fine. 

387
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,300
 You should be fine since you took 
expensive medicine at the ER. 

388
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,750
Geez, I feel like...

389
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,540
someone said I got 
expensive medicine.

390
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,720
Go to sleep.

391
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,460
Are you going out?

392
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,650
I'm going to work out.

393
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,750
Nah.

394
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,090
For real. I exercise at night.

395
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,260
Goodnight.

396
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,640
Nah...

397
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,950
It's true.

398
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,430
No way...

399
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,460
♫  Now we are going to 
like each other  ♫

400
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,520
Moong!

401
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,660
♫  Now we are going 
to like each other  ♫

402
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,750
My goodness...

403
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,980
Gosh, you should be careful.

404
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,400
Do you like me that much?

405
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,520
What are you saying?

406
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,400
I can't see well in the dark.

407
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,290
You should've just dropped 
off the medicine.

408
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,660
Why were you with him
 for so long in there?

409
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,160
Anyway, you're so nosy.

410
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,980
Are you jealous?

411
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,770
What jealousy?

412
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,700
You are.

413
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,110
I think so.

414
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,150
You're mine.

415
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,540
♫  Even those precious 
days might pass  ♫

416
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,170
Finally, it's our alone time.

417
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,680
I had quite a day today.

418
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,580
Me, too.

419
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,540
Did something happen?

420
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,650
How about you, Koala?

421
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,870
Is James doing okay?

422
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,330
He got scared a bit.

423
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,620
I hope James gets 
his memory back.

424
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,550
I feel sorry for him.

425
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,870
Well, actually...

426
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,260
- James is...
- Oh.

427
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,380
When I skipped out on work that day,

428
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,890
I ran into your mother.

429
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,470
At a batting cage.

430
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,030
 Your feet apart, stick out
 your butt like this. 

431
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,340
 Hold the bat like this. 

432
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,170
 Put 1,000 won in there. 

433
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,150
 Ah, okay. 

434
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,660
- Really?
- Yeah.

435
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,810
How did you know she was my mom?

436
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,570
Oh, at the work event last time...

437
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,140
Seo Ah told me.

438
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,710
Oh, I see.

439
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,680
But your mom is so cool.

440
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,720
It was like this back then.

441
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,970
She was teaching me 
standing like this.

442
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,480
She had such a cool pose.

443
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,160
She swung like this.

444
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
She was powerful, too.

445
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,230
Bang! Her swing was awesome.

446
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,840
Her strength was... bang!

447
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,610
She's so strong.

448
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,360
When I see you,

449
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,700
your actions are so grand. 
So over the top.

450
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,150
Now that I see you, 
you look like my mom.

451
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,760
How so?

452
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,370
I see.

453
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,730
My beauty?

454
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,960
Your strength.

455
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,010
She is strong.

456
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,970
♫  We will make a beautiful love  ♫

457
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,140
Did you have fun?

458
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,280
Yeah.

459
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,570
Isn't my mom pretty?

460
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,370
Yeah, she's really pretty.

461
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,430
But she couldn't hit the ball.

462
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,730
Really?

463
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,630
 Get lost within the next 24 hours. 

464
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,390
 If you don't pack up and move out
 of Samgwang Villa tomorrow, 

465
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,130
 I'll just... 

466
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,750
 Today, I just tickled you a little bit. 

467
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,060
 Just know that. 

468
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,770
That's not enough?

469
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,730
- Ttak Bae.
- Yes.

470
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,320
Don't do this, Hyungnim.

471
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,670
I don't like to get beat up.

472
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,150
It hurts.

473
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,060
Hyungnim, if you keep doing this,

474
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,720
I'll spill everything.

475
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,050
What?

476
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,150
That you...

477
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,320
abandoned your daughter
 a long time ago.

478
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,770
To get your hands on some fortune.

479
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,570
S***.

480
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,770
Do you think Seo Yeon 
will believe that?

481
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,530
Do you think she'd believe you?

482
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,540
Why wouldn't she believe...

483
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,020
what her beloved boyfriend says?

484
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,410
Hyungnim.

485
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,900
You know, I...

486
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,930
like Bit Chae Woon
 with pure intentions.

487
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,720
I'm different from you from ages ago.

488
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,180
Please bless our love.

489
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,030
I'll be good.

490
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,760
Bit Chae Woon.

491
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,640
Can't you just like me?

492
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,110
If you liked me,

493
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,540
even if you're not worth 
a bundle of money,

494
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,210
I would've let it go.

495
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,750
Had I known this would happen,

496
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,190
maybe I should've been her friend.

497
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,410
Don't come close!

498
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,630
This is real! My cross!

499
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,950
My cross!

500
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,050
What do I do?

501
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,980
He always wakes up when 
I need to go to the bathroom.

502
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,180
 

503
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,750
What's this?

504
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,780
What's this?

505
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,940
A ghost! Here is my cross!

506
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,810
- With my cross...
- What are you doing?

507
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,770
- What?
- What, what the heck?

508
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,720
Oh, my! Oh, my gosh!

509
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,060
- You're crazy.
- The ghost...

510
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,530
- You're crazy.
- The ghost...

511
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,080
- You're crazy!
- It's because of the ghost.

512
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,670
- Hey, how dare you!
- No!

513
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,500
You!

514
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,280
Manager, let me apply for 
this trainee position in France.

515
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,020
Please give me one last chance.

516
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,150
Please?

517
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,930
It's not as easy as you think.

518
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,700
You have to go to France

519
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,880
and get trained for
 two years. It's tough.

520
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,400
It doesn't mean you'll
 make it in the end.

521
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,700
It's okay even if I don't make it.
 Just one last chance, please.

522
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,000
I really worked hard all this time.

523
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,550
Let me discuss it with the CEO.

524
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,670
Thank you!

525
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,300
Thank you!

526
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,950
Live or die, Lee Hae Deun.

527
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,730
This is your last challenge.

528
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,400
50,000 won!

529
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,590
You said you'd send me 50,000 won.

530
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,640
I still haven't received it.

531
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,370
Did I say that?

532
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,790
I forgot.

533
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,410
Give it to me now.

534
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,290
Sure, okay.

535
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,150
Let me see.

536
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,670
I don't have any cash.

537
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,520
I said to send it to me here.

538
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,350
I don't do any phone banking
 or internet banking.

539
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,640
Whoa, then did you mean
 you'd send it from the bank?

540
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,970
Yes. That's right.

541
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,880
Let me make a suggestion.

542
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,180
If you sit for 50 minutes again today,

543
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,770
I'll add 50,000 won. I'll give you
 a total of 100,000 won. Okay?

544
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,900
You look like you're very angry.

545
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,190
All right. 130,000.

546
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,840
120,000 won.

547
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,240
Deal.

548
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,770
Let's go.

549
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,720
Mr. Makjang... no...

550
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,940
Mr. Mark Jang.

551
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,810
Your contract happens to 
be up with our academy.

552
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,070
Let's part ways now.

553
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,980
The end. Okay?

554
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,210
Bye.

555
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,650
Wait...

556
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,330
How about my 50,000 won?

557
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,290
- Let's go to the bank together.
- Wait!

558
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,720
Wait. Ouch.

559
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,070
Ow, my elbow. My arm broke.

560
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,190
- My arm...
- You don't have money.

561
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,430
Thank you. I'll be back again.

562
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,750
I'll stay in touch.

563
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,670
I didn't suggest that 
you sell your shoes.

564
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,700
Don't blame me.

565
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,290
Why would I blame you?

566
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,630
I was getting tired of 
that design anyway.

567
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,260
But still, I know this place well. 
She gave you a good price.

568
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,140
- Really? I'm so grateful.
- Gosh.

569
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,200
Give me my money.

570
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,430
My money.

571
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,850
What? Money?

572
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,090
I should pay you.

573
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,010
One, two, three...

574
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,720
Five. Here.

575
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,810
Four.

576
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:42,910
Four. Yup.

577
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,330
You don't fall for it.

578
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,440
All done. Have a good day.

579
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,800
What good day? Hey.

580
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,970
What's your name?

581
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,890
Gosh, they all do this.

582
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,110
Why?

583
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,990
I'm afraid you'd sign up 
for my class in the future.

584
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,530
They can't seem to forget me,

585
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,830
so they google me and 
come looking for me.

586
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,220
No worries. I know your name.

587
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,670
I'll be sure to avoid you.

588
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,730
- Mr. Makjang.
- What?

589
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,620
Not makjang.

590
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,790
- It's Mark Jang.
- I know.

591
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,920
It's not daenjang, 
gochujang, ssamjang...

592
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,810
it's Mr. Makjang. Bye.

593
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,660
Daenjang, gochujang, ssamjang?
 Is she trying to be funny?

594
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,780
She's so funny. So funny.

595
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,110
Gosh, seriously.

596
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,590
 Mom... 

597
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,980
 do you know an ahjumma 
named Byun Mi Ja? 

598
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,630
 They must've grown up so nicely... 

599
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,780
 despite the fact that one 
of them was stolen. 

600
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,780
Mother.

601
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,960
Hi, Mr. Woo.

602
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,840
Gosh, for the construction
 in Hwak Se's room?

603
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,210
Yes.

604
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,920
My gosh. You're working so hard
 when you're busy already.

605
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,840
Let's have some snacks.

606
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,190
All right.

607
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,570
Give me one.

608
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,970
Thanks.

609
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,250
 Byun Mi Ja? 

610
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,700
 Who's that? 

611
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,830
 

612
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,730
  The customer is not 
answering the phone.  

613
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,020
You won't answer, huh?

614
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,340
 Ahjumma, I can't reach you. 

615
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,840
 I'd like to discuss something
 important with you. 

616
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,960
 Please give me a call. 

617
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,030
Look at her.

618
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,450
It's true. She is
 Park Pil Hong's daughter.

619
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,170
 

620
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,170
Let's see how long you avoid me.

621
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,440
All right. Let's get back to work.

622
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,290
 - Okay.
- Yes! 

623
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,480
Let's go.

624
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,230
You didn't get one.

625
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,600
Thank you.

626
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,440
Let's do it.

627
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,940
 I'm still working on
 Hwak Se's room ceiling. 

628
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,640
 You miss me, huh? 

629
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,030
 Nope. 

630
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,790
Mr. Woo.

631
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,890
- Aigoo.
- You worked hard.

632
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,460
- Aigoo...
- Drink it.

633
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,420
Thank you, Mother.

634
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,960
My gosh, Mr. Woo.

635
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,540
Did you just call me "mother"?

636
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,430
Yes.

637
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,380
 Because you're my Moong-i's mother. 

638
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,950
It makes me so happy to 
hear you call me "mother."

639
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,100
In any case,

640
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,570
Na Ro refuses to eat lunch.

641
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,540
I wonder if he has bad flu.

642
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,910
Cunning Penguin didn't go to work?

643
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,280
Oh, Na Ro didn't go to work?

644
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,760
Yeah, I guess...

645
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,460
He won't open the door for me, either.

646
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,550
S***...

647
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,060
Geez!

648
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,090
How did you get in here?

649
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,390
How else? I got the key
 from Mother and opened it.

650
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,640
So what? We're both men.

651
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,860
I heard you didn't eat breakfast.

652
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,880
I'm not interested.

653
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,500
What's going on?

654
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,690
You should tell us, 
so we can help you or not.

655
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,820
Geez, mind your business.

656
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,680
Oh-ho?

657
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,010
Did you come into my room before?

658
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:35,450
It's my first time. 
This is all my first time.

659
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,590
I came in worried, 
yet you're suspicious of me.

660
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,990
Here.

661
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,690
Eat.

662
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,080
So, are you two dating?

663
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,620
Are you dating Bit Chae Woon?

664
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,380
Can't you feel it already?

665
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,090
Why pretend not to know 
when you're so quick?

666
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,720
How about Jang Seo Ah?

667
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,740
Nothing is going on 
with Jang Seo Ah?

668
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,650
You're testing me, too?

669
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:01,620
No.

670
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,860
Nothing is going on with Seo Ah.

671
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,260
I'm sure you feel it, too.

672
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,960
Accept it, Cunning Penguin.

673
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,440
Accept it and...

674
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,510
let's be friends. Okay?

675
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,590
I don't want to.

676
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,660
Geez, Hwang Na Ro...

677
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,090
Hey.

678
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,660
You don't have any friends, right?

679
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,720
Even if you did,

680
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,950
you only know people who ignore you
 when you're down and out, right?

681
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,050
What good is your bed?

682
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,660
You sleep like this
 on the floor so pathetically.

683
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,360
Aigoo, poor penguin.

684
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,030
Eat a lot. Don't be picky.

685
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,030
And...

686
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,270
here is your dessert.

687
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,560
I have to go on a diet.

688
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,040
You have it.

689
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,280
Geez.

690
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,850
Geez.

691
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,790
- Hae Deun, you're home early.
- Hello.

692
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,560
I'm leaving again. I got some money, 
so I bought clothes. I wanted to try it on.

693
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,900
Oh, really?

694
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,280
Didn't Na Ro oppa go to work?

695
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,000
He has the flu.

696
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,400
I see.

697
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,630
You know...

698
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,600
I saw something strange.

699
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,580
- Something strange?
- Yeah.

700
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,840
Was it you, Lee Hae Deun?

701
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,700
You were in my room?

702
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,010
 

703
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,030
What, Noonim?

704
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,730
Bit Chae Woon?

705
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,600
Yeah.

706
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,810
She keeps calling me...

707
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,430
and texted me to meet her.

708
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,760
You told me to give her 
my phone number, so I did.

709
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,800
Maybe I shouldn't have.

710
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,460
You did fine.

711
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,230
Ignore her calls and 
drag it out for now.

712
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,530
Your job is to delay Bit Chae Woon

713
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,990
from moving into her
 birth mom's house.

714
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,160
Got that?

715
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,730
I got it.

716
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,970
Hwang Na Ro is struggling big time.

717
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,880
Please shake up Bit Chae Woon.

718
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,400
What?

719
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,450
Am I making it sound too difficult?

720
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,500
Seduce Bit Chae Woon.

721
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,450
From what I see,

722
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,280
I think you're interested in her.

723
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,190
Be more aggressive and pursue her.

724
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,000
Well?

725
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,220
Longer Bit Chae Woon can delay
 her move into her birth mom's house,

726
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,280
it'd benefit Jang Seo Ah.

727
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,610
 Hwang Na Ro. 

728
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,780
 I just got this information. 

729
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,020
 Chairwoman Lee Choon Seok
 is in Korea. 

730
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,980
 Kim Jung Won and 
Jang Seo Ah don't know yet. 

731
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,640
 Grandma Lee Choon Seok... 

732
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,860
 I heard she adores Jang Seo Ah. 

733
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,120
Of course.

734
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,810
Okay.

735
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,590
Nice.

736
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,860
  The customer is not
 answering the phone. 

737
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,820
  You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

738
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,610
Why don't you answer 
my calls, Mom?

739
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,190
I think you're avoiding 
my calls on purpose.

740
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,780
Please call me.

741
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,470
Back then...

742
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,930
why did you lie to me?

743
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,420
Saying that my Seo Yeon died.

744
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,250
If you keep avoiding my calls, 
I'll come to you.

745
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,270
I know you're in Korea.

746
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,000
Please call me.

747
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,780
Hi, Min Jae.

748
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,180
Jung Won.

749
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,750
I said you didn't have to come. 
Why did you come?

750
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,600
You never answered my calls.

751
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,930
No matter how busy you are, 
you always call me back.

752
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:55,850
Yet I heard nothing from you.

753
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,600
How can I not worry?

754
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,500
Why do you look so bad?

755
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,040
Are you sick? Is something wrong?

756
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,010
No, I'm just busy with work.

757
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,590
By chance...

758
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,100
did Seo Yeon's dad come out?

759
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,730
Who cares whether he's out or not?
 It has nothing to do with me.

760
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,360
Then what is it?

761
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,790
Gosh, why is everyone 
doing this to me?

762
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,650
You're all busy hiding things.

763
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,700
 To be honest... 

764
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,830
 I want to open up 
everything to you, Min Jae. 

765
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,910
What is it?

766
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,770
What's wrong with your mom?

767
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,840
I can't tell you just yet...

768
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,550
There really is something.

769
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,730
If you say it's still a secret...

770
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,160
I can't help it.

771
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,480
Mother.

772
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,130
- Jae Hee has a girlfriend?
- Yes.

773
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,650
How can he do that to me?

774
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:07,950
But you know...

775
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,450
you two...

776
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:14,670
weren't really together officially.

777
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,180
Isn't it up to Jae Hee to
 decide whom he'll like?

778
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,110
Seo Ah.

779
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,710
When it comes to these things,

780
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:30,590
you need someone to set things
 straight for you even though it hurts.

781
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,910
When it comes to a man and a woman
 relationship, no means no.

782
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,910
You may be sad if you think
 of me as Jae Hee's mom.

783
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,070
But think of me as 
a sunbae in life.

784
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,780
Then I'm right.

785
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,080
But...

786
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,940
who's Jae Hee's girlfriend?

787
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,810
Mother.

788
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,690
You know Soon Jung ahjumma?

789
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,570
Yeah, of course, I do.

790
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,170
It's her daughter.

791
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,390
He's dating that ahjumma's daughter.

792
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,040
What?

793
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,290
 Jae Hee oppa lives in 
Soon Jung ahjumma's villa. 

794
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,320
 I think they got close while living there. 

795
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,990
 Is that the case? 

796
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,100
Jae Hee, this punk...

797
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,330
He didn't tell me anything even though 
he was living in Soon Jung's house.

798
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,650
On top of that, 
Soon Jung's daughter...

799
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,020
This neighborhood is weird.

800
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,470
There's something here.

801
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,940
Mom said not to tell her.

802
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,160
I couldn't help it.

803
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,510
Jae Hee oppa does 
whatever his mom says.

804
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,780
It's better that Mother knows.

805
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,530
Young lady.

806
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,390
You didn't eat lunch yet, right?

807
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,740
Eat some jokbal.

808
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,590
Isn't Uncle Hwak Se here?

809
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,760
He went to an interview for his gig.

810
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,040
Hwak Se is a singer.

811
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,760
I see.

812
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,390
Sit here and wait.

813
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,130
I'll bring it out real quick.

814
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,820
Excuse me.

815
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,600
Yes?

816
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,610
You're a girl.

817
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:39,780
Do you know where 
Samgwang Villa is around here?

818
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,530
Well...

819
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,150
Why?

820
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,750
I'm looking for someone.

821
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,850
 Looking for someone? 

822
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,420
 By chance... 

823
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,000
 James ahjussi's debt collector? 

824
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,770
But...

825
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,640
why do you ask why when 
I'm asking for directions?

826
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,950
Go over that way.

827
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,050
Thanks.

828
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,450
Did you wait long?

829
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,260
- Aigoo.
- Why?

830
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,580
Why, why?

831
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,180
Why, why, why?

832
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,910
Why? What's going on?

833
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:20,270
An ahjumma was looking
 for Samgwang Villa just now.

834
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,900
She said she's looking
 for someone.

835
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,860
But you said you're running 
away from debt collectors.

836
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,240
For now, I told her 
the wrong direction.

837
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,750
Hide in here.

838
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,110
Thanks.

839
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,970
Where is Samgwang Villa?

840
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,750
Oh, my!

841
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,330
- Hello.
- Hi!

842
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,510
I'm so glad to run into you here.

843
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,260
Yes, me, too.

844
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,000
What brings you here?

845
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,420
I'm here to meet my son.

846
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,200
You're... well...

847
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,170
your name is?

848
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,000
I'm Lee Bit Chae Woon.

849
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,520
Lee Bit Chae Woon?

850
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,650
Oh, my. What a pretty name.

851
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,320
I'm Jung Min Jae.

852
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,720
Yes.

853
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,070
What are you doing here, 
Lee Bit Chae Woon?

854
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,180
Oh, I live around here.

855
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,210
 I have to tell her Koala
 lives in my house. 

856
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:31,040
Then by chance, do you know
 where Samgwang Villa is?

857
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,600
I asked a student over there,

858
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,510
but I think she told me wrong.

859
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,290
Oh, well...

860
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,540
actually, I also...

861
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,250
- Woo Jae Hee.
- Mom!

862
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,330
Mom, what are you doing here?

863
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,320
Hey.

864
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,280
I heard you're dating the daughter
 of the villa you live in.

865
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,510
Did Seo Ah tell you?

866
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,880
Let me see her face.

867
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,370
- Let's go.
- Mom.

868
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,660
Hold on. So...

869
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,930
Let's go.

870
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,900
It was nice to see you.

871
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,800
Mom.

872
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,910
To tell you what's going on...

873
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:12,240
I'll introduce myself.

874
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,770
What?

875
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,390
Mom, I'll introduce you
 to my girlfriend.

876
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,350
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

877
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,900
What?

878
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,860
 Then you're Soon Jung's daughter? 

879
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,240
Hwak Se.

880
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,330
Hi, Noonim.

881
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,820
How did your interview go?

882
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,150
Hwak Se.

883
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,550
It's okay.

884
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,450
For now...

885
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,550
heal your throat first.

886
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,050
And take your time. Okay?

887
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,690
Yes, Noonim.

888
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,490
- Noonim.
- Yeah?

889
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,410
I'm not down.

890
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,090
Aigoo.

891
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,710
Of course not.

892
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:15,210
- Hwak Se.
- Are you going to work?

893
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,180
- Yeah.
- Okay, go ahead.

894
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,470
- Okay.
- Yes.

895
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,500
Bye.

896
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,380
Long time no see, Lee Soon Jung.

897
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,550
Could we talk for a moment?

898
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,920
Well...

899
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,960
this is the house.

900
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,090
Gosh, I came empty-handed.

901
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,510
- I should buy something.
- Gosh, no.

902
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,830
Next time.

903
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:30,150
Let's go inside.

904
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,930
- Shall we?
- Yes.

905
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:40,920
Geez...

906
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,960
Yoo Jae Hee.

907
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,680
Go! Go!

908
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,510
Go back inside! Hurry!

909
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,430
Why?

910
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,800
Yoo Jae Hee.

911
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Someone came looking
 for me earlier...

912
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,610
Let's talk later. Go back inside.

913
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,090
- Why?
- My mom is here.

914
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,230
I'm afraid...

915
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,290
she'll find out about us acting
 during the executives' meeting.

916
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,950
Then I'll go.

917
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,070
Go. Hurry up and go.

918
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,850
Geez, my heart.

919
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,170
Gosh, Noonim just left.

920
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,650
It would've been nice 
for her to say hello.

921
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:22,240
I'll call my mom.

922
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,520
No, no.

923
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,340
You said she went to work.

924
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,260
I'll see her next time.

925
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,480
Okay.

926
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,910
Have some tea.

927
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,770
I want to see Jae Hee's room first.

928
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,250
Wait, what about my room?

929
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,430
You don't have to see my room. 
It's really messy.

930
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:39,630
Don't you think I know
 how messy you are?

931
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:40,820
Koa...

932
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,200
I'll take you up to Mr. Woo's room.

933
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,310
- Thanks.
- Wait...

934
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,680
Jae Hee, where is James hyung?

935
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,510
At the store...

936
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,860
James?

937
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,080
Yes.

938
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,200
James hyung...

939
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,260
He lives with us here.

940
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,420
He's very close to Jae Hee.

941
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,860
They share the room.

942
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,750
Why are they sharing a room?

943
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,190
Oh, he used to share my room...

944
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,110
but there's construction going on 
in my room. So he's with Jae Hee.

945
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,000
They'll share only until
 the construction is finished.

946
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,420
I see.

947
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,360
Geez, it's almost time for 
Eems hyung to stop by here.

948
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,360
That hyung is so...

949
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:24,070
Yes, look around.

950
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,310
What?

951
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:29,600
I don't like you.

952
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,410
That stings.

953
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,100
Why?

954
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:40,460
Wait, wait, wait!

955
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,170
Wait a minute.

956
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,740
Let me clean up a little bit.

957
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,720
Why is he freaking out so much?

958
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,450
Okay. Yes.

959
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,530
Come in.

960
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:15,990
Oh, my.

961
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,180
Oh, my.

962
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,170
Look at you sweating.

963
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,830
Aigoo, you're still so scatterbrained.

964
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:29,070
- Geez.
- You scared me.

965
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:30,700
My underwear.

966
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,700
Look at me.

967
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,320
It took me long enough to
 visit my son's place.

968
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,060
Gosh, well...

969
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,750
It's all the same. Nothing to see here.

970
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,220
Let's go downstairs
 and have some tea.

971
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,950
Hold on!

972
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,470
 This smell... 

973
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:55,180
 is Woo Jung Hoo's odor. 

974
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,750
What are you doing?

975
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,330
 Prisoner Park Pil Hong was released. 

976
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,420
 Your request for a visit 
has been canceled. 

977
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,290
Park Pil Hong...

978
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,730
was released?

979
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,160
I don't know how to 
express my gratitude.

980
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,180
Thank you, Soon Jung, 
for raising Seo Yeon...

981
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:39,630
Oh, it's Bit Chae Woon now.

982
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,800
Bit Chae Woon is all grown up now.

983
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,950
Did you meet my Chae Woon?

984
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:52,050
Gosh, I'd be too ashamed.
 I saw her from afar.

985
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,330
From afar.

986
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,900
♫  Riding on it...  ♫

987
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,240
By chance, you're not going to...

988
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,970
appear as Chae Woon's
 father now, are you?

989
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,100
Why can't I?

990
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,960
Bit Chae Woon is my child. 
How can you cut off blood ties?

991
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,580
Blood ties?

992
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,950
After doing that, how can you now...

993
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:23,770
say you're Chae Woon's father?

994
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:26,360
Do you think Young Lady 
Jung Won will do nothing?

995
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,850
What...

996
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,300
did I do?

997
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,910
What?

998
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,770
Geez, I guess I got dumber these days.

999
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,130
I can't remember.

1000
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:45,160
Don't ever come around
 this neighborhood.

1001
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,620
Don't come around Chae Woon, either.

1002
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,260
If you...

1003
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:52,480
hang around this neighborhood, I'll...

1004
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,700
You'll...

1005
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,880
What?

1006
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,270
I'll kill you.

1007
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,450
Lee Soon Jung, you got gutsy.

1008
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,700
Soon Jung.

1009
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,090
Do you think I'd sit back
 until you do that?

1010
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,550
Anyway, thanks.

1011
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:18,560
For keeping Chae Woon close.

1012
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,970
Right.

1013
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,530
It's right for me to get 
close to my daughter

1014
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,800
and send her to Jung Won.

1015
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:32,250
Aigoo.

1016
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,990
It hurts, Ms. Soon Jung.

1017
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,450
Do whatever you want.

1018
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,850
I'm not scared of you at all now.

1019
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:47,650
I'll never sit back, either.

1020
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,510
 Soon Jung. 

1021
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:58,760
 Do you think I'd sit back
 until you do that? 

1022
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:03,110
I have to protect my Chae Woon.

1023
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:05,390
I have to protect Chae Woon.

1024
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:08,440
I'll protect my Chae Woon.

1025
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,760
I'll protect her.

1026
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,830
Mom!

1027
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,230
Chae Woon.

1028
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,910
I thought you went to work.

1029
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,150
- Go in.
- Huh?

1030
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,210
Oh, yeah.

1031
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,850
- Mom, earlier...
- Chae Woon.

1032
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,070
Yeah?

1033
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,310
You...

1034
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,730
You, go.

1035
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,420
What?

1036
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,030
You...

1037
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:52,130
go to your birth mom.

1038
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,330
Mom, again?

1039
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:58,310
If you don't go,

1040
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,650
I'll turn myself in.

1041
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,460
Turn yourself in?

1042
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,700
What do you mean?

1043
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,320
And say I was...

1044
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,850
the kidnapper.

1045
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,320
What did you say?

1046
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,560
I...

1047
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:25,810
I... I stoled you.

1048
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,190
I...

1049
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:31,150
I stoled you.

1050
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,120
Mom.

1051
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:05,740
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1052
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:14,350
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1053
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,820
 

1054
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,040
 Woo Jung Hoo was there. 

1055
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,960
 
 Then, my job is... 

1056
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:22,410
 Mom! 

1057
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:24,560
 Your dad has amnesia? 

1058
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,630
 Mom, Mom, Mom! 

1059
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,750
 To me, Bit Chae Woon and 
you're both same daughters. 

1060
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,160
 We're the same? 
Do you really think so? 

1061
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,790
 Chairwoman is here. 

1062
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:35,320
 Did you really confirm 
Seo Yeon's body? 

1063
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,710
 Let's take a risk. 

1064
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:37,710
 Hello. 

1065
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,210
 What did you want to 
discuss with me? 

1066
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,650
 Ms. Byun Mi Ja? 
Why are you so stunned? 

1067
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,400
 Hwang Na Ro revealed everything. 

1068
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,130
 She says she left her cellphone. 

1069
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,240
 
 Chairwoman? 

1070
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,990
 - Yes?
- Don't you get it? 

1071
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:50,320
 What's the point of trying to 
send Seo Yeon to our house now? 

1072
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,420
 Park Pil Hong. 
She's that scumbag's seed. 

1073
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,900
♫  The rain called you is 
making me wet  ♫
