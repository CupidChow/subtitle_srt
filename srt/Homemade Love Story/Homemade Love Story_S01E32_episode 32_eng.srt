1
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,230
- Mr. Park Pil Hong! 
 - Yes!

2
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,130
Am I right?

3
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,950
You are Park Pil Hong.

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,800
  Mr. Lee!  

5
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,290
- Hello. I guess you're here to see Mr. Woo. 
 - Yes.

6
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,230
You're out for lunch, right?

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,250
We're about to go for lunch right now, do you want to join us?

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,600
I would like to, but my coworkers are waiting for me at the restaurant.

9
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,220
Ah, that's a bummer.

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,050
Then, let's have lunch together next time!

11
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,370
Yes, I'll get you something delicious for you next time.

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,000
- I have a great memory! 
 - Yes, please remember this.

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,100
Then, I'll see you later.

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,120
- Have a nice lunch! 
 - Yes!

15
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,300
How can I made that dumb mistake!

16
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,900
     

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,790
     

18
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,300
Yes, Min Chul. Did you see the photo that I sent you?

19
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,750
Is that the right photo that you sent to me?

20
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,080
  This is not the one that I sent you. What's going on?  

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,120
  Did someone switch the photo?  

22
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,000
Is there something going on?

23
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,270
Ah, oh, it's about my work.

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,300
About the building that you're going to build? I guess you're busy with that right now.

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,800
Yes, about that.

26
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,930
Why?

27
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,280
Oh, nothing. I felt really down when I was coming here,

28
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,830
but I saw you and saw Mr. Lee. Somehow that made me feel better.

29
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,430
It's really strange. Whenever I see him, he makes me feel happy.

30
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
You said he's popular at the site as well, right?

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,800
Yes. Everyone likes him.

32
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,870
It would have been great if we could have lunch together with him.

33
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,770
By the way, something happened to you today?

34
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,460
Ah, there's someone called Executive director Jang at our office.

35
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,550
- Do you mean Seo Ah's uncle? 
 - Yes.

36
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,320
He said he got a call from Park Pil Hong this morning.

37
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,700
From your biological father? What did he say to him?

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He said there is a daughter between him and the CEO.

39
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,150
So please admit her.

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,500
Why did he say that to him?

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,310
He can tell the CEO directly.

42
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,320
I know.

43
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,670
Since he called the Executive director like that, I think the email incident was done by him, too.

44
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,900
  I wonder if he's trying to get some money by using me.  

45
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,420
What is it?

46
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,200
Oh, this is the mother's room.

47
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,230
Oh, my goodness!

48
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Oh, Ra Hoon! I thought your mother was in this room, so that's why I came in here...

49
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,700
Who are you!

50
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,260
Mother, I'm--! Mother, I'm--!

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,280
- Mr. Makjang! 
 - Let me go.

52
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,730
- How did you... 
 - Mother, oh, I got hit constantly. It's me, Joon Ah. Jae Hee's friend!

53
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,300
- Hae Deun, isn't he your company's CEO? 
 - Yes...

54
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,800
Joon Ah, why are you here?

55
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm so sorry about the other day. That time I drank too much.

56
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,730
- Hello. 
 - It hurts...

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,100
I'm so sorry. I thought it was the bathroom and went in there.

58
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,160
You should've asked me!

59
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,300
I went in there because I heard some sound...

60
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,100
You must have been shocked.

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,700
- Joon Ah, when did you come back from London-- 
 - Mother, mother!

62
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,600
Is your coat made by someone from London? It's very pretty.

63
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,740
Have some tea.

64
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,600
Oh, it's the ginger tea.

65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,200
- Yes, because you liked it last time. 
 - No, probably Woo Jung Hoo liked it.

66
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,500
- CEO, have some tea as well. 
 - Thank you for the tea.

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
- What are you doing? 
 - It's too hot, it's too hot.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,010
  - Are you okay? 
 - It's great! It's delicious.  

69
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,520
Why did Jae Hee's mom have that dictionary?

70
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,750
She would've not stolen that.

71
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,660
Did she throw a tantrum like the old-time?

72
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,260
Did she take it away from Soon Jung?

73
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,510
This dictionary, I'm going to take it now.

74
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,000
- No, you can't take it. 
 - I'm going to take it! Give it to me!

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,180
- No, you can't. 
 - Give it to me!

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,810
- Boo! 
 - Young lady Min Jae!

77
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,860
I doubt that.

78
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,980
Probably, kind Soon Jung must have given that to her.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,900
She knew that Jae Hee's mom wanted to have that for a long time.

80
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,970
But, how can Soon Jung just give that to her that easily?

81
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,900
That makes me sad.

82
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
Yes, Mr. Jung.

83
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Brother-in-law! You always came out to the office even though it's a company holiday, but where are you today?

84
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,920
I already went to the office early in the morning.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,940
Ah, I knew you would've.

86
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,400
Why did you call me?

87
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,260
You asked me before about when is my sister's next doctor's appointment is.

88
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,100
Yes, I did. When is it?

89
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,760
  It's today.  

90
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,900
What?

91
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,390
- Call the police! Call the police! 
 - You bastard!

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,100
How can you not tell your mother that you came back from London!

93
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,300
I was going to go see my mom right after this, but I happen to run into you first. Trust me!

94
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,450
So, people in Samgwang villa only knows you as Jae Hee's friend, but doesn't know that you're Jung Won's son?

95
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,130
That's right.

96
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,130
I get it. Go now!

97
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,700
You have to confess to your mom! I'm going to check that later!

98
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,170
- Yes, I understood. I'll see you later-- 
 - Stop grinning like that!

99
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,030
Go!

100
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,000
- I'll see you later! 
 - Hurry up and go!

101
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,370
- You have to turn yourself in! 
 - Yes, ma'am!

102
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,780
Joon Ah is such a problem. It's totally Jung Won's one-way love to him.

103
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,960
My son is the best.

104
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,090
What should I do with this? My goodness...

105
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,600
My goodness!

106
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,700
Did your part-time work end already?

107
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,500
Yes. I'm not working today originally, but I came here, so it ended early.

108
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,330
Ah...

109
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,810
You can keep going the way you were.

110
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,490
I heard that you're going to the doctor's appointment today.

111
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,130
Yes.

112
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,670
How did you know about that?

113
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,220
I do have an appointment. I'll get going first.

114
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,590
Wait.

115
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,500
What is it? Is the food all gone?

116
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,400
No, it's not about that.

117
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,430
I want to come with you to the hospital.

118
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,970
Do you even know what kind of doctor's appointment I have?

119
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,400
I know.

120
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,080
It's the manic-depression treatment.

121
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,750
How did you know that?

122
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,580
When I was hospitalized, I heard what you and Jae Hee were saying.

123
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,420
I heard about today's doctor's appointment through your brother.

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,500
- That's surprising. 
 - I don't have any other meaning to this.

125
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,680
But when I lost my memory, you helped me with a friendship,

126
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,600
so I thought it would be right for me to help you with my friendship...

127
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,100
- Are you sure you're not sick or anything? 
 - I'm sorry?

128
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,300
I mean, you are very different from before. It makes me concerned.

129
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,190
What if you lose your memory again?

130
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,990
- I said that in the thought of you, but if you don't like it, then forget about it! 
 - No, wait!

131
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,400
Let's go together! There's no reason for me not to like it.

132
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,330
Let's go.

133
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,720
Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Na Ro.

134
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,820
Have a seat.

135
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,150
Seo Ah asked me for support.

136
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,100
You have a criminal record of fraud.

137
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:15,320
I bet you would've thought that I would look up about that.

138
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,220
Seo Ah said there was an unavoidable reason.

139
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,840
- I had been living abroad for a long time-- 
   - I already heard about that from Seo Ah.  

140
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,790
Why are you helping my Seo Ah?

141
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,570
I have feelings for her.

142
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,810
Are you sure that feeling is not for Seo Ah's money?

143
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,190
I sincerely like her.

144
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,490
If you see me from now on, you'll be able to trust me.

145
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,130
If I support you,

146
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,900
how would you repay me?

147
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,900
I'll do anything you ask me to do. And,

148
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,200
I can protect you from Park Pil Hong.

149
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,700
Did you have a good lunch?

150
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,400
Yes. How about you?

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,400
Can I talk with you for a second?

152
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,700
I'm sorry that I deceived you.

153
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,080
I was right.

154
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,960
I hoped I got it wrong.

155
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,900
Then, you're not Lee Dong Chool in the first place.

156
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,420
Right.

157
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,300
Then, the photo from my friend was also by you, Mr. Lee...

158
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,470
I mean, you switched it, sir.

159
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,940
- I didn't do that with a bad intention. I just-- 
 - You came close to me with a fake name,

160
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:20,080
and you changed the photo that was sent to me. How can you say that has no evil intention?

161
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,570
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,370
I guess it is a bad intention.

163
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:33,450
I did that because I wanted to stay close to my daughter, Seo Yeon.

164
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I am a bad person.

165
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,430
I've wronged Seo Yeon and her mom.

166
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,320
I committed a lot of crimes when I was young.

167
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,360
I never killed anybody, but I went into prison multiple times for fraud.

168
00:13:52,380 --> 00:14:00,810
But I didn't come close to you with a bad intention.

169
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,650
I believe you know Hwang Na Ro.

170
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,640
We were in prison together.

171
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,900
Then, I bet you know he got close to Chae Woon with a bad intention.

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,610
That's why I was staying around Seo Yeon more. What if that bastard do something terrible to her--

173
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:28,300
That bastard, he already did enough harm to Chae Woon. He's doing it right now, too! He's pushing her to the edge of the cliff.

174
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,200
Honestly, isn't this all started because of you?

175
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I think you are also staying around Chae Woon with a bad intention.

176
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,640
You sent photos to Chae Woon's company's board of directors, and you called the Executive director Jang today.

177
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,420
- Isn't this all about you trying to get money by using her? 
 - Who said I did that?

178
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,470
I didn't do any of those!

179
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,320
- You didn't do that? 
 - Of course not! Why would I do that?

180
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,700
Then, is it by Hwang Na Ro?

181
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,200
  Hwang Na Ro, that bastard.  

182
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,580
     

183
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,870
Yes, Chae Woon.

184
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,560
You said I should call you when I get to the office. I did good, right?

185
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,340
Yes, thank you.

186
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,000
Do you feel better now?

187
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,210
Yes, I feel better because I saw you.

188
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,130
But something feels off.

189
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,930
What is it?

190
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,370
You sound a bit awkward.

191
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,670
What are you talking about it?

192
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
Are you at the site?

193
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,600
- Yes. 
   - Oh, then Mr. Lee would make coffee for you.  

194
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,700
Mr. Lee's coffee?

195
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm drinking right now.

196
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,610
Ah, I want to drink the coffee made by Mr. Lee.

197
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,430
  Then, tell him that I'll visit there soon to have some coffee!  

198
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,170
Sure.

199
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,430
I'll tell him that you'll visit soon to have some coffee.

200
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,400
  Okay. Koala, good luck with your work!  

201
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,220
I love you!

202
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,440
  Why did an emergency board meeting happen?  

203
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,220
I overheard it from the secretary's room, and it's about the re-confidence of the CEO.

204
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,830
  Why? Did the CEO do something wrong?  

205
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,390
  I don't know. I heard it was some issue about morality.  

206
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,770
  - They were talking about something like that. 
 - An issue of morality?  

207
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,280
What are you going to do from now on?

208
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,430
I'm not sure.

209
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,860
I guess I should leave since you caught me.

210
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:29,970
I know it's shameless to ask, but it's my small wish that

211
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,460
I want you to leave me as Lee Dong Chool to Seo Yeon for now.

212
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,040
Are you asking me to lie to Chae Woon?

213
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm not forcing you.

214
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,610
That's why I said, "it's my small wish."

215
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,420
Until when?

216
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,500
Please leave it like that until I can do one good thing as a father to her.

217
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,300
So I'm asking when would that be?

218
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,000
I think it'll be soon.

219
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,420
- Instead, I'll leave your construction site. 
 - No.

220
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,210
Don't do that.

221
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,120
- What? 
 - Don't leave the site.

222
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,230
I want you to stay in front of my sight, at the site, the whole time.

223
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,460
You have to stay within the range that I can check on you.

224
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,370
Also, whatever you're going to do from now, you should talk with me first.

225
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,900
You said you want to be a good father to Chae Woon.

226
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,100
Right.

227
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,710
I'm the one that Chae Woon loves the most in this world.

228
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,490
So, I want you to listen to me, please.

229
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,440
If you disappear, I'm going to tell Chae Woon that Mr. Lee, who she liked so much,

230
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
who makes good coffee and good at sewing,

231
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,900
was actually the Park Pil Hong. I'm going to tell her about that.

232
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,870
If she figures out that her biological father deceived his identity and was around her to take fortune out of her--

233
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,390
I wasn't trying to get any fortune.

234
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,220
Anyway, how would Chae Woon feel about that?

235
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,999
She wouldn't want to see you forever.

236
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,070
Do you want that to happen?

237
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
Are you threatening me?

238
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,840
Why would I threaten you when you're Chae Woon's father?

239
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,400
Will you do what I said?

240
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,230
I'll think about it.

241
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,210
Okay.

242
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,510
Yes, Chief Yoo.

243
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,300
I'll be there soon.

244
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,020
Why don't we go back to work? Let's start the afternoon work.

245
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,480
Why don't you go first? I'll follow you after I finish drinking this. This place makes this the best.

246
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,490
Then come right after drinking that.

247
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,960
You're not going anywhere, are you?

248
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,390
I'll trust you.

249
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,440
Trust? Me?

250
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,490
He shouldn't trust me.

251
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,970
By the way, he thinks I'm such a softy.

252
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,540
I treated him nice since he's Seo Yeon's boyfriend, and now he's crawling up.

253
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,990
But he's a nice kid.

254
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,070
Maybe he resembles Min Jae?

255
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,550
This is good.

256
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,300
This place is the best.

257
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,190
- You came together finally. 
 - I'm sorry?

258
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,990
I kept asked her it'll be great if she can come with her partner.

259
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,510
I told you before, doctor. We got a divorce.

260
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,140
Just because you got divorced doesn't mean everything is over.

261
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,190
Putting your feelings together after breaking up is important, too.

262
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,320
  - I'm glad you're here today.   
 - Yes.

263
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:21,440
It seemed like Ms. Jung Min Jae's manic-depression was getting better, but it came back a bit these days...

264
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,450
Did it get worse?

265
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,580
Did something happen these days?

266
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,100
There's nothing special.

267
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,800
  Do you really don't recognize me? Can't you really remember me?  

268
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,700
  But you just lost your memory all by yourself and made me shocked!  

269
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,970
  Did that all happen because of me? Did he become like that because I abandoned him?  

270
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:57,560
I think the person who still influences most of her psychological state is the husband.

271
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,120
Me?

272
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,060
That's not true, doctor! I don't think about him anymore.

273
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,930
He's here today in favor of friendship. Guest-starred as my friend!

274
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,860
I told you that you don't have to come!

275
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,150
  I want to suggest something.  

276
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,590
  Why don't you have a therapy session together?  

277
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,770
Do you want to do therapy with me?

278
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,900
Well, I'm a very busy person.

279
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Right. We're already separated, so there's no reason for us to go somewhere together.

280
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,260
When we were living together, we didn't go anywhere together beside your family's event.

281
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,850
I don't know why I asked you about it this time.

282
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,800
What are you looking at?

283
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:00,200
I think you became like this because of piled up anger and resentment towards me.

284
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,090
You probably still hate me so much.

285
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,160
That's true.

286
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,300
Sometimes even when I was fine, I start shaking at the thought of what you've done to upset me.

287
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,300
I think this is the Hwa-byung that the older generation mothers used to say. 
      

288
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,990
Actually, there's something that works immediately to cure the Hwa-byung.

289
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,820
What's that?

290
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,830
- Do you want to know? 
 - Yes.

291
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:35,290
I think I'd feel better if I beat the hell out of the person who made me like this.

292
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
What?

293
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,100
Beat them up, pinch them really hard,

294
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,780
bite them off, and grab by their hair and throw them away!

295
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,220
Jae Hee's father! I'm not going to do that to you!

296
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,390
My goodness, really! Jae Hee's father! Jae Hee's father!

297
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,300
He gets scared easily.

298
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,180
I thought I'm going to have a cramp underneath my armpit.

299
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,500
  How can it makes sense for us to get a disgraceful phone call because of your private life, CEO?  

300
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,800
  Since this kind of rumor continues, we can't help but have to push the re-confidence vote about you.  

301
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,200
CEO, Chairwoman is here.

302
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,130
I heard about the board meeting.

303
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,700
I heard you weren't feeling great.

304
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,900
I had to make that excuse, at least. Why would I go to the board meeting to get into any trouble?

305
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,100
What did you get yourself into!

306
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,340
You should kick Bit Chae Woon out first.

307
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,790
If the world knows about Bit Chae Woon is your biological daughter,

308
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,460
and then you'll be completely over!

309
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,700
Did you come all the way here to say that to me?

310
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,300
Come in!

311
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,200
Why are you here, Hwang Na Ro?

312
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,950
I called him.

313
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,900
I hired Hwang Na Ro as my direct secretary.

314
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,570
Chairwoman!

315
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:37,680
Hwang Na Ro. When I'm coming out to the company, assist me, and other than that, help director Jang's work.

316
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,060
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,010
Hwang Na Ro.

318
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,980
Can you give us some space?

319
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,290
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:56,860
Chairwoman. I definitely disapproved of appointing Hwang Na Ro as secretary.

321
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:02,140
You might have refused him because you don't need him, but I need him.

322
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,670
So don't talk back to me.

323
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:19,240
How can you move the Chairwoman like this?

324
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,600
It's because you didn't approve.

325
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,940
- I disapproved because it's not an appropriate appointment! 
 - It's not because of that,

326
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,910
but you rejected it because you don't like Hwang Na Ro.

327
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,310
That's right. I don't like him.

328
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,360
He gives a bad vibe.

329
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:41,090
- That you keep getting close with Hwang Na Ro-- 
 - Mom!

330
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,340
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

331
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,400
You didn't care about me this much!

332
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,450
You only cared about Bit Chae Woon these days.

333
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,850
Why are you suddenly stepping into my life?

334
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:01,240
Are you in an intimate relationship with Hwang Na Ro?

335
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,020
I'm getting closer to him.

336
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,530
- Why are you keep being like this? 
 - Then what should I do!

337
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,740
Jae Hee oppa rejected me, and you're not on my side as well.

338
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,730
There's no one besides me, so I have to have at least Hwang Na Ro on my side!

339
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,300
Having Hwang Na Ro close with us will be a good thing for you for now, too, CEO.

340
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:41,700
Because of the last Spain project's achievement, uncle also trusts him.

341
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,220
What?

342
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,710
Executive director Jang?

343
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,510
Also, director Hong likes him, too.

344
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,800
Did you already introduce Hwang Na Ro to the board of directors?

345
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm going to appoint Hwang Na Ro as the secretary.

346
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,750
It wouldn't be as much as Bit Chae Woon,

347
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,330
but if you still think about me,

348
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,130
then let me do this.

349
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,590
Seo Ah!

350
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,100
I bet the CEO Kim Jung Won will oppose this, but what can she do about it?

351
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,650
Now I took the line of the Chairwoman.

352
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,260
How did it go?

353
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,710
Hwang Na Ro.

354
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,300
Let's do great work together.

355
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,900
Is it decided?

356
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,600
Official notice will come out tomorrow, so don't tell any other coworkers about this.

357
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,000
You better do it well.

358
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,700
Don't put me in trouble.

359
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,730
Congratulations.

360
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,460
A permanent position.

361
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,600
Did I get it?

362
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,820
It's my first permanent position.

363
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,700
I got a permanent position!

364
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Wow, I got a permanent position!

365
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,900
     

366
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,160
Yes, Na Ro!

367
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,830
Yes, mother. Are you busy?

368
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,470
No, I'm not busy. What made you give me a call?

369
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,230
Ah...

370
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,350
I got converted to a permanent position!

371
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,330
Oh, is that so?

372
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,630
Na Ro, you must have worked well!

373
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,300
  It's really hard to get a permanent position these days.  

374
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,680
Yes.

375
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,000
Na Ro, you did great!

376
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,700
  Congratulations!  

377
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,970
Thank you, mother! I just heard the news, and I thought about you first.

378
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,850
  Did you?  

379
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,940
Thank you for thinking about me, Na Ro.

380
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,590
Na Ro.

381
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,260
  You'll be better and better in the future!  

382
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,010
  Our Na Ro is a good person.  

383
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,650
  Na Ro, you really did great!  

384
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,600
  I'm happy for you! It's great news!  

385
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,500
Yes, mother. Thank you!

386
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
Yes, I'll talk to you later.

387
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,560
Bigger! Bigger!

388
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,010
You said you're a singer.

389
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,630
Yes.

390
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,370
Your throat is damaged a lot.

391
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,590
I think you should get treatment more regularly.

392
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,360
Ah, okay.

393
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,170
Would it make me sing better?

394
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,040
I don't know. Your throat got damage a lot.

395
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,140
- Hello, doctor Kang. 
 - Hey!

396
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,530
How is our Hwak Se's throat?

397
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,600
It's not in good condition, but we have to see after getting treatment.

398
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,750
You should do better treatment!

399
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,170
Hwak Se, this is the one who went to medical school with me.

400
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,350
Oh, yes. Nice to meet you.

401
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,800
I heard that you're Man Jung's boyfriend.

402
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,710
Yes.

403
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,150
You look a bit young.

404
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,460
I'm six years younger than her.

405
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,700
So you should do a better treatment for him.

406
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,420
He will be a great singer in the future.

407
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,580
I get it.

408
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,020
So how's your paper going these days?

409
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,430
It's just going.

410
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,270
  Hey, from the last conference, the case that doctor Hong published was a bit unique, wasn't it?  

411
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:44,400
- Oh, yes. That was very amazing. I never saw anything like that before. 
    - I know, me neither.  

412
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,320
Jjung-a, thank you so much for making a doctor's appointment.

413
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:56,480
So you have to get treated well and recover your throat.

414
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,600
By the way, is it okay for you to introduce me around as a boyfriend?

415
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,630
Then, should I call you my girlfriend?

416
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,810
I mean, but still.

417
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,260
What is it? Are you embarrassed by me because you're six years younger than me?

418
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,860
- I guess you're power-playing to me because you're handsome. 
 - No, it's not like that.

419
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,650
Babe, look at this. I was searching a little bit.

420
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,190
And then, I found a Trot competition. 
      

421
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,180
If you win by singing through the phone,

422
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,900
then they let you go on TV. Should we try this?

423
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,880
I tried this in the summer and failed it big time.

424
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,800
No! That time your throat wasn't in good condition. After you get treated well and practice hard, I think you'll totally get it.

425
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,230
Let's try it.

426
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,070
You should give it a try! My wish is for you to get your dreams to come true.

427
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,610
- Jjung-a. 
 - Yes?

428
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,230
- My wish right now is... 
  - Yes.

429
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
- Follow me. 
 - Where are we going?

430
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,200
- Chief Yoo. 
 - Yes?

431
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,810
Where did Mr. Lee Dong Chool go?

432
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,500
- He said he's not feeling well and got off from work early. 
 - Oh, really?

433
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,900
Did this guy run away?

434
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,740
Ah, I should've not left him there.

435
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,120
Hey, kid.

436
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,030
Do you live in that apartment?

437
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,300
Hello, we just moved in here today.

438
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,200
Oh, this apartment had been empty for a while, and you moved in today.

439
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,030
But why are you sitting out here? It's cold.

440
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,740
The lock is broken. My father will come home soon.

441
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,550
Ah, is that so?

442
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,100
Then, do you want to stay in my place until your father comes home?

443
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,950
It's cold out here.

444
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm okay.

445
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,210
I'm not okay. Why don't you come in?

446
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,780
Then, thank you for letting me stay in your place.

447
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,690
You're very cute.

448
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,760
Have a seat there.

449
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,060
Do you want some hot cocoa?

450
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,100
- Thank you. 
 - You have good manners!

451
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,990
     

452
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,390
Is your name is Ms. Min Jae?

453
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,480
Yes, it's Jung Min Jae.

454
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,100
I'm Son Ba Wi.

455
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,300
Ba Wi? Wow!

456
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,300
That's a strong name! It's awesome! 
      

457
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,400
I think this phrase is impressive. "Min Jae, enjoy!"

458
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,070
My father always emphasizes 'enjoy' to me.

459
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,590
He said life is something you enjoy.

460
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,000
Wow, your father is awesome, too!

461
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,600
Here.

462
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Drink this.

463
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,000
It's hot, so be careful.

464
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,170
- Thank you for the drink! 
 - Sure!

465
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,330
Is it good?

466
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,830
Hey, Jang Joon Ah. I heard you ran into my mother as well.

467
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,000
  Did you already hear about that?  

468
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,820
  I think I'm going to bump into everybody that I know except my mom.  

469
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,570
What are you talking about it?

470
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,840
Mom said you should turn yourself in now.

471
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,560
Turn me in?

472
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,500
- Turn me in. 
 - "Turn me in?"

473
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:11,130
You have to turn yourself in as soon as possible. If you run into your mom before telling her, she would be very sad.

474
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,170
I got it. Bye!

475
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:25,050
  I have eyes on the back of my head as well, so I know that you're looking at me right now, Hae Deun. Do I look cool?  

476
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,030
  Is he being chased as well?  

477
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,420
  Maybe like James, he's also scared of a debt collector?  

478
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,730
  Is this company insecure?  

479
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:43,040
  Ah, maybe that's why he didn't have money to pay for my part-time job.  

480
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,980
Just tell me. Talk to me.

481
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,360
What about it?

482
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,620
The thing that you're thinking inside.

483
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,400
What do you think I'm thinking about it?

484
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,600
I bet it's something like, "You're so cool, CEO!"

485
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,380
I guess you're shy.

486
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,160
I'll be back from outside.

487
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,420
- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going to turn myself in.

488
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,200
For what?

489
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,100
If I don't come back, then just think I went to a good place.

490
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,020
What?

491
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,400
  Your surprised face is very cute! You look like a bunny rabbit.  

492
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:36,470
Ah, I might get locked in if I went to the house,

493
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,060
so it's better to come to the office. Yes, it's better here.

494
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,810
It's a better choice.

495
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,590
Oh? Excuse me, sir! Aren't you the one at Jae Hee's company?

496
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,000
  This bastard again!  

497
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,400
Right? Is it not?

498
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,370
I heard that your nickname is 'the tiger of Jiri mountain,' from Jae Hee.

499
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,020
- Don't you remember me? 
 - Ah, yes.

500
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,090
- Hello. 
 - Oh, hello.

501
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,020
You pretended you didn't remember me the other time, but I guess you remember me today.

502
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,700
- When did I do that? 
 - I'm sorry?

503
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,410
I guess then that was really a different person. What brings you to be here?

504
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,110
My daughter works here.

505
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,120
Ah, your daughter works here! What department does she work in?

506
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,840
My younger sibling works here, as well.

507
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,850
- Your younger sibling? 
 - Yes.

508
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,000
You look great in suits, so I almost didn't recognize you.

509
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,080
Sir, why don't we go somewhere else?

510
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,050
Why are you here?

511
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,510
I'm here for a business.

512
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,710
Do you know my mom?

513
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,850
  Jung Won, you should keep your cool.  

514
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,750
Then, I'll get going.

515
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,660
Sir, sir!

516
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,480
Mom, I'm really sorry.

517
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,300
I'm really sorry.

518
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,100
Hello.

519
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,100
I was really going to tell you before.

520
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,820
But I just couldn't because I felt sorry.

521
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,400
I should turn myself in. I was keep thinking I should tell you, and six months passed by.

522
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,000
But I came here multiple times to see you.

523
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,730
But somehow, whenever I came here, you weren't in your office.

524
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,090
I'm sorry.

525
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:49,400
Mom, are you c-crying? Please, don't cry. I'm really sorry.

526
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm really sorry.

527
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,360
Is that dude my Jung Won's step-son?

528
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,450
- Joon Ah. 
 - Yes?

529
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,520
Did you think I didn't know about anything?

530
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,520
I knew that you came back six months ago.

531
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,180
Did you know about it?

532
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,410
I was waiting for you to contact me first.

533
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,050
But you only called Seo Ah, so I was very sad.

534
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,020
Mom, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

535
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,510
It's all my fault.

536
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,580
- If I were a comfortable mom, you would've not done this. 
 - No, don't say that.

537
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,520
And how's your online shop going?

538
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,640
Is it going well?

539
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,760
Did you know about that, too?

540
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,270
You always said you don't want to work for this company and don't want to do business,

541
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:05,130
but I think you have good business skills.

542
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,690
I'm watching your work.

543
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,940
I have to go out now for an external meeting.

544
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,400
Then you should hurry up!

545
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,780
Joon Ah, whenever you want to, come home.

546
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,650
- Come home whenever. 
 - Yes, I will.

547
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,520
- I'll get going. 
 - Yes, have a good meeting.

548
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,790
Goodbye!

549
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,200
Goodbye!

550
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,310
Wow, really...

551
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,270
This is why I can't be close to my mom.

552
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,570
How did she know about everything?

553
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,600
It's very scary. Seo Ah's scary, and mom's also scary.

554
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,980
All of my family is scary!

555
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,940
  Jung Won, let's meet at the cafe in front of the company in an hour.  

556
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,150
  I couldn't call you because I had something to deal with first.  

557
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,780
Why is she not leaving when she said there's an external meeting?

558
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,690
By the way, who is that guy?

559
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,730
I thought he was just a construction worker, but he doesn't seem like that today.

560
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,090
Maybe he had to hide his identity like me.

561
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,300
That doesn't make sense.

562
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,550
The helmet suited him so well.

563
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,660
Hello, Chairwoman.

564
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,320
- You should go outside. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

565
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,190
You're the one who sent the email to the board of directors, aren't you?

566
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,600
You bastard, how can you revenge me like this!

567
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,000
Chairwoman. I also want Jung Won to be well.

568
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,750
So, why would I do something like that?

569
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,210
It would've done by someone else.

570
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,460
What?

571
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,040
I have a couple of business items that I'm working on right now.

572
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,470
     

573
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I'll start the briefing.

574
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,580
Park Pil Hong.

575
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,060
You think your daughter is a way to get money, don't you?

576
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,930
I don't think of her as my granddaughter.

577
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:53,580
But how can you come over here because you're her father, and try to get my money?

578
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,190
- What kind of bullshit is this! 
 - Chairwoman.

579
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,870
You can't be like this.

580
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,960
How can you not accept Seo Yeon, who is a legitimate granddaughter of yours?

581
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,770
- You loved her so much before! 
 - What?

582
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,600
How can you blab anything!

583
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,230
Chairwoman. I don't know if you remember this.

584
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:20,400
You gave me some money to shut up, saying that you want to make Seo Yeon as someone who doesn't exist in this world.

585
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,160
That time, I changed my mind later on

586
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,000
and looked for Soon Jung so much to get Seo Yeon back.

587
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,980
Because I didn't know you took her away.

588
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,050
That story is all done.

589
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,190
Jung Won and Seo Yeon both know about that!

590
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,000
There is a difference between only My Jung Won and my daughter Seo Yeon knowing about that,

591
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,350
and everybody in the world knowing about it.

592
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:49,340
The world got more advanced

593
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,750
so that an old-fashioned tape can be converted to a smooth voice file.

594
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,000
This has a conversation between you and me talking about that incident.

595
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,400
What?

596
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:07,570
You didn't think it can be covered up that easily when you did that wrong, did you?

597
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,800
Please accept my Seo Yeon as your granddaughter.

598
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,380
Also, please make some investment in my business. Will you?

599
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,800
Ah, I knew you're going to throw that out,

600
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,800
so I made more copies. 
      

601
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,550
What?

602
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,500
Bit Chae Woon's biological father is having a meeting with Chairwoman?

603
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,260
How did he come here already...

604
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,050
He's not an ordinary person.

605
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,600
It's better for us.

606
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:49,580
He came here all by himself, so we should use him well.

607
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,700
Trust me.

608
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:03,310
  Go to Um cafe. The CEO is meeting up with your biological father.  

609
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,030
Seo Yeon, how did you come here?

610
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,200
The person you were meeting up with,

611
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,540
where did he go?

612
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,860
He just left.

613
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,300
Is that so.

614
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,300
Seo Yeon.

615
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,310
Park Pil Hong.

616
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,030
You just met him, right?

617
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,400
Seo Yeon!

618
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,900
I can't believe even Park Pil Hong was around her.

619
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,460
  The CEO and my mom, all of them, are hurt because of me.  

620
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:37,940
  I wonder where is the place that I should be.  

621
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,640
I want to meet him, too.

622
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,790
Please let me meet him.

623
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,560
I don't want you to meet him.

624
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,080
Please, I'm asking you, Seo Yeon.

625
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,880
Please don't meet him.

626
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:31,800
I gave you an unforgettable pain,

627
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,130
Park Pil Hong came back,

628
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,970
and also, Seo Ah is not listening to me more and more.

629
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,800
I'm really exhausted these days.

630
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,000
Is it because Seo Ah

631
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,960
getting close with Hwang Na Ro?

632
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:58,940
She managed to make him appointed as the secretary.

633
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,300
By using the Chairwoman.

634
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,520
Seo Ah,

635
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:09,850
she reminds me of when I was young.

636
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,520
It makes me feel bad.

637
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:22,320
I can't tell if she really likes Hwang Na Ro or she's just like that on purpose to throw a tantrum.

638
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,910
I don't know what to do.

639
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,800
Mom.

640
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,440
Yes?

641
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,400
What if I go back to the Samgwang villa?

642
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,790
What?

643
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,050
Are you saying that because of what happened yesterday?

644
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,750
Why are you like this on top of everything?

645
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,430
Can't you just take my side?

646
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,710
Can't you just understand me one time? I said I couldn't help it!

647
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:05,940
I want to be in front of other people as your mother proudly. But...

648
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,460
Seo Yeon.

649
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,800
I'm sorry.

650
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,140
I'm sorry for everything.

651
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,670
I think I should go just for a while.

652
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,130
You're suffering this much,

653
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,730
and also for Seo Ah.

654
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,700
It's freezing!

655
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:52,280
Thank you so much! Have a good night! Thank you!

656
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,800
     

657
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,050
I want to do it well this time

658
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,200
and make my Jjung-a happy.

659
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:25,650
♫   It's good! It's very, very good.    ♫

660
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,930
  Excuse me!  

661
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,830
Yes!

662
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:48,430
  I think the person who still influences most of her psychological state is the husband.  

663
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:05,660
Should I bring these over to her myself?

664
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,800
Ba Wi, you're good at writing, too!

665
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,660
Thank you!

666
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,910
My hand-writing is messy.

667
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:23,400
Aren't you getting hungry?

668
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,300
I'll make you something for dinner. Let's eat together.

669
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,820
It's okay. My dad will come home soon.

670
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,800
Let's eat first!

671
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,100
What should I make for you? Oh?

672
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,310
It's my dad!

673
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:46,410
- Dad! 
 - Yes, Ba Wi. I'm home!

674
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,400
Hello! I'm sorry. I had an urgent thing to deal with.

675
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,420
Noonim!

676
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,270
Professor!

677
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:01,140
Professor! You were Ba Wi's dad?

678
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,540
Yes.

679
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,740
Do you live here?

680
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,140
Yes. So you are the one who moved to the next door?

681
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,500
Yes. We moved in today.

682
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,180
It's good to see you.

683
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,540
Now we're neighbors.

684
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,370
That's true!

685
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,000
- I'm very excited to be your neighbor. I'll see you around more. 
 - Me, too.

686
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,590
I felt so sorry, so I bought something to eat.

687
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,600
No, it's okay. You should have it with Ba Wi. He must be hungry.

688
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,700
I wonder if your mom will be home late.

689
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,810
I don't have a mom.

690
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,330
What?

691
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,330
I was passing nearby, and I--

692
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,310
Huh?

693
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,920
- Who are you? 
 - Who are you, grandfather?

694
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,900
G-Grandfather?

695
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,700
Oh, oh!

696
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,500
W-Who are you?

697
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,700
Hello. We met the other time at her store.

698
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:48,820
Ah! I guess you are Min Jae's father!

699
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:51,590
What? F-Father..?

700
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,500
- Oh, it's-- 
 - I'll introduce myself formally.

701
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,600
I'm Son Jung Hoo.

702
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,520
Hello, grandfather! I'm Son Ba Wi.

703
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,800
She's beautiful because she resembles you.

704
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,770
You and Min Jae looks exactly the same!

705
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:14,260
That's true! Grandfather and Ms. Min Jae looks exactly the same!

706
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,900
Why am I a grandfather!

707
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,600
- Oh, no, Ba Wi!  
 - Ba Wi.

708
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,890
Ba Wi, don't cry!

709
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,340
  - It's okay. 
 - Ba Wi, it's okay.  

710
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:45,710
  I didn't want to be a burden to the CEO.  

711
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,770
  What if I go back to the Samgwang villa?  

712
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,040
  I'm relieved that you said it's not true,  

713
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,300
  but rumors can spread easily.  

714
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,250
  Other people and shareholders can be disturbed quickly.  

715
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,950
     

716
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,910
Soon Jung!

717
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,010
Yes. I have something to talk about with you.

718
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,790
Do you have time this evening?

719
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:50,250
I talked with Chae Woon earlier.

720
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:58,340
She wants to go back to the Samgwang villa.

721
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,300
I think it's because, in her perspective,

722
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:11,660
she's concerned about you worrying, so she must have said that.

723
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:15,510
I thought so, too.

724
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:25,270
Also, the thing that you said before,

725
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,090
about making Chae Woon my legal daughter.

726
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:42,600
I think you should take your time to think about that.

727
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,780
Yesterday, I talked too forcefully.

728
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,710
But I thought about it,

729
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:57,870
and I feel like I didn't think about your situation and said that.

730
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,730
I'm sorry about that.

731
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:06,050
No, I can totally understand where you're coming from. You can think that way!

732
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:17,260
I'll just say it right now.

733
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:30,360
I thought about this a lot.

734
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:37,200
But for now,

735
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:46,680
I think it's hard for me to make Chae Woon my legal daughter.

736
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,400
CEO!

737
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,410
I'm sorry.

738
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,400
So,

739
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,030
you should take her with you.

740
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:19,490
  I want to be in front of other people as your mother proudly. But...  

741
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:29,900
     

742
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,200
  Moong-i, are you almost here?  

743
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,140
  Come soon. I miss you.  

744
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,640
Oh! Ms. Lee!

745
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,280
Ah, are you leaving now?

746
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,980
Of course, I shouldn't be there when the busy couple is finally reuniting.

747
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,150
No! You can hang out with us.

748
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:56,440
No, no! I'm busy with my own relationship.

749
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,570
The blind date that I told you about before.

750
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,070
- That went well! 
 - Oh! Congratulations!

751
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,800
Congratulations to you, too--

752
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,080
I'll get going. I'll see you around! Bye!

753
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,500
- Yes. Have a nice date night! 
 - Yes!

754
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,750
It's so cold...

755
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,560
You should be happy, my friend.

756
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,500
It's freezing!

757
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,300
- Oh! Wait, wait a bit more! 
 - Oh! Not now?

758
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,920
  Not yet! Not yet!  

759
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,590
  You can come in now.  

760
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:29,600
♫   After I met you,   ♫

761
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:36,100
♫   I'm happy with small changes   ♫

762
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:42,950
♫   In the bright shining morning,   ♫

763
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:49,510
♫   I start the day thinking about you   ♫

764
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:56,170
♫   Sitting across from the dinner table,    ♫

765
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:02,960
♫   Asking how was your day   ♫

766
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:09,700
♫   And saying my day was pretty okay   ♫

767
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:17,100
♫   I want to answer you with a smile   ♫

768
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:23,900
♫   When we feel the same way about little things,   ♫

769
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:30,490
♫   I got surprised at how familiar we got. I love you   ♫

770

♫   I just want to be as peaceful as we are now forever   ♫

771
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:43,030

772
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:49,430
♫   I'm so happy that I met you   ♫

 ♫   The reason why I could love you this much   ♫

774
01:04:56,050 --> 01:05:02,780
♫   is because you embraced my immature and lacking heart   ♫

775
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:09,650
♫   with your warm understanding   ♫

776
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,410
♫   Thank you for everything   ♫

777
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,850
Bit Chae Woon.

778
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,850
I love you.

779
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,340
Do you love me, too?

780
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,510
I said that a lot before.

781
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,540
But please answer me now.

782
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,920
I love you.

783
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,770
Then,

784
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,350
in the near future,

785
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,280
let's live together.

786
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,910
Let's get married, Chae Woon.

787
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,000
Yes! Jae Hee oppa.

788
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:39,290
♫   I'm in love, I'm in love   ♫

789
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:49,500
♫   I guess love changes everything   ♫

790
01:06:49,500 --> 01:07:02,840
♫   You make me fill up my whole day with the thoughts of you   ♫

791
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:08,000
♫   With you   ♫

792
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:26,000
♫   Meeting like a fate, and stopped time   ♫

793
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:32,390
♫   I knew it was all   ♫

794
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,320
♫   I'm in love, I'm in love    ♫

795
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:46,810
♫   I guess love changes everything   ♫

796
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:53,590
♫   You make me fill up my whole day with the thoughts of you   ♫ 
      

797
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,620
  The guy who you talked with in the lobby,  

798
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:59,790
  I met him at Jae Hee's site. He was working there.  

799
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,300
  I heard Cha Ba Reun is looking for another place to live.  

800
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,800
  Are you really going to leave this place?  

801
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:04,700
  Thank you for everything until now, Lee Ra Hoon.  

802
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,100
  Please don't leave, Cha Ba Reun. Don't go.  

803
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,960
  Min Jae. Thank you for making food for this father.  

804
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,290
  Then, have a good night, father!  

805
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,210
  Bit Chae Woon, good morning!  

806
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,660
  - You look great. 
 - You look great as well, director.  

807
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,900
  I'm great! There was someone in the house that I hate to see, and they left yesterday.  

808
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,500
  Bit Chae Woon! I'm with your father right now.  

809
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,230
  I'll put him on the phone.  

810
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,400
  Why are you not picking up the phone? It's Mr. Lee.  

811
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,900
  Oh, it's...
