1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,040
 
You guys can't get married!

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,920
Why not?

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,220
You can't!

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,710
Not yet.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,410
Not yet?

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,060
Mom.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,950
I thought...

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,070
among Chae Woon's mother, 
CEO, Mom and Dad,

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,600
I thought you'd be the 
happiest. Right, Moong-i?

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,840
Yes.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,770
- Moong-i?
- Ah, no...

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,350
Chae Woon.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,310
Moong-i is your terms of endearment?

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,750
Moong-i? Moong-i? Wow...

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,590
It's so cute.

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,870
I'm Kamjiki.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,590
His name is Kajiki.
 My favorite stuffed animal.

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,330
Hi, Kamjiki.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,650
That's yours?

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,080
I saw that at Dad's place.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,480
It's clean now. You washed it, huh?

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,570
Why is the sofa so messy?

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,700
Have some tea. It will get 
cold, Chae Woon.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,820
Okay.

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,370
My goodness...

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,140
You scared me.

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,690
- Gosh, my mom...
- Why?

28
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,050
Mom, you're joking, right?

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,710
To scare us?

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,240
- Joking?
- Well, you know...

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,030
"I'm against this marriage."

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,380
That's a typical line said by Korea's 
mothers-in-law to be.

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,500
You wanted to try that, huh, Mom?

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,650
Me?

35
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,620
You loved to watch dramas, Mom...

36
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,190
This is how funny 
my mom is, Chae Woon.

37
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,050
My sense of humor comes 
from my mom 99% of the time.

38
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,960
I see. I think you did.

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,620
That is true.

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,200
If he took after his dad, he'd be so dull.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,540
Oh, James... no...

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,450
Father is very funny, too.

43
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,590
Funny? Woo Jung Hoo?

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,910
Fine. I heard that 
Samgwang Villa people

45
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,920
like Woo Jung Hoo and
 think he's funny.

46
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,370
But not him and me.

47
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,060
We won't ever in the future.

48
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,210
Right, right.

49
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,160
This is...

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,280
so good!

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,700
Gosh, you scared us.

52
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,510
See? My mom is totally on our side.

53
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,880
So I was thinking, Mom...

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,050
I want to get married soon.

55
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,630
So let's skip all the formalities...

56
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,560
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,900
I just said I'm against your marriage!

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,420
You were kidding.

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,050
We laughed about it and 
got past it. Stop it now.

60
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,270
Of course, we'd laugh about it. 
Would I argue with you guys?

61
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,360
You know how much
 I like Bit Chae Woon.

62
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,130
You like...

63
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,760
Why are you opposed 
to it if you like her?

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,800
Mom, by chance...

65
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,300
Well, Chae Woon knows everything.

66
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,000
Since you and Dad split,

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,030
are you saying that because you 
have negative thoughts on marriage?

68
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,780
Hey, that's my personal life.

69
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,360
Why would I put that on 
you guys? So tacky.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,440
Then what?

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,900
By chance, could it be 
because my situation

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,400
hasn't been settled since I've been
 revealed as the CEO's daughter?

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,700
Gosh, no, no.

74
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,570
Jung Won is my close friend, and

75
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,190
I know her very well. 
Who cares about that?

76
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,740
I like it even more because
 you're Jung Won's daughter.

77
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,890
Oh, since we're on the topic,

78
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,280
how did you take care 
of the family registry?

79
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,610
Are you registered as 
Jung Won's daughter?

80
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,020
Well, as for that, not yet...

81
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,490
Due to situations Mom
 is facing at work,

82
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,820
we decided to put that off for now.

83
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,600
What?

84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,040
The situation at work? What...

85
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,760
That Jung Won girl is ridiculous. 
Even if the situation at work...

86
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,930
I shouldn't talk like that. Sorry.

87
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,310
We've been friends ever 
since we were little.

88
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,550
Then what's your reason for
 opposing our marriage?

89
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,060
Are you curious?

90
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,650
Yeah!

91
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,490
You, too?

92
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,920
Yes.

93
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,650
I mean...

94
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,390
I'm not really opposing it.

95
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,470
I just need to check something.

96
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,760
Just wait a little bit.

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,580
What?

98
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,320
What do you need to check?

99
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,060
So I'm saying...

100
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,330
Just wait a little while, Bit Chae Woon.

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
Eat.

102
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,800
- Macaron.
- Okay.

103
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,350
It's delicious.

104
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,930
 

105
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,890
I never dreamed that my mom 
would be against it.

106
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,370
Chae Woon, are you disappointed?

107
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,000
A little bit.

108
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,610
But she didn't say she 
was totally against it.

109
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,810
I know.

110
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,320
What does she need to check?

111
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,320
Is it because of my birth father?

112
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,520
Mother knows what kind of 
man Park Pil Hong is.

113
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,680
I'm sure she does, but...

114
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,610
Geez, my mom doesn't judge 
you with that kind of stuff.

115
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,760
Oh, could this be it?

116
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
 You said you knew Chae Woon's
 mother before, right? 

117
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,080
 How do you know her? By chance... 

118
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,850
 your first love? 

119
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,090
 What? That's nonsense! 

120
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,090
 - It is!
- No, it's not! 

121
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,120
 - It is!
- I said, no! 

122
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,150
What?

123
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,660
I think...

124
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,740
my father and your mother were

125
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,700
first loves in the past.

126
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,430
What?

127
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,680
Did they date then?

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,300
I'm not sure about that.

129
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,150
I'll have to ask my dad about it.

130
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,350
Let's go.

131
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,450
Okay.

132
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,930
Okay.

133
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,940
Jung Hoo!

134
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,890
What's going on?

135
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,570
Did you color your hair?

136
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,770
How do I look? Do I look
 like James Dean?

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,100
Not sure...

138
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,200
Jung Hoo, are you dating someone?

139
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,580
Look at you.

140
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,780
That terrible kid.

141
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,270
He'll be shocked when 
he sees me again.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,220
All right.

143
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,300
♫  My love, let's live a good life together  ♫

144
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,760
 Those expensive cookies. 

145
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,490
 What's the point of buying
 them for me now? 

146
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,540
 So what if you buy me tons of them? 

147
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,180
 We're finished now. 

148
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,320
♫  I love you, I like you  ♫

149
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,860
♫  I only trust you  ♫

150
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,780
Min Jae...

151
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,220
must be enjoying those cookies

152
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,220
while badmouthing me.

153
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,630
♫  In my eyes, to me  ♫

154
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,200
I wonder if they were disappointed.

155
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,450
Would they dislike me?

156
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,660
No.

157
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,740
I should still confirm.

158
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,170
♫  I love you  ♫

159
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,600
Woo Jung Hoo's...

160
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,720
old love.

161
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,410
♫  On a sunny day, on a rainy day  ♫

162
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,500
♫  You were always with me  ♫

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,360
 If you hold this and blow into 
the air as you make a wish, 

164
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,630
 it will come true. 

165
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,980
 Of course, it doesn't always come true. 

166
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,830
 I see... 

167
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,230
 Would you like one? 

168
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,700
 Oh, no. 

169
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,100
 Just try it. 

170
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,660
But...

171
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,210
why does Min Jae have
 that red dictionary?

172
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,930
♫  I only trust you  ♫

173
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:58,870
♫  As we change as the time passes  ♫

174
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,160
No matter how much I think about it,

175
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,140
I think Young Lady Min Jae 
took that dictionary.

176
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,210
♫  You only sparkle to me  ♫

177
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,580
My gosh.

178
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,980
Did she want to have it that much?

179
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,500
Aigoo...

180
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,760
Oh, yeah!

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,270
My Chae Woon.

182
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,080
I wonder how she did today.

183
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,810
Should I order more of this?

184
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,810
Yeah.

185
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,050
All right.

186
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,640
What's the most popular item
 for women these days?

187
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,720
This is popular these days.

188
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,430
This one?

189
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,070
I see.

190
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,350
Okay.

191
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,060
Excuse me.

192
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,770
Hi, Mom.

193
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,220
 Hi, Chae Woon. 

194
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,860
Did you visit Mr. Woo's mother?

195
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,580
Yeah, a little bit ago. 
We had a pleasant visit.

196
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,670
Oh, really?

197
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,390
What did she say?

198
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,590
She's happy to hear about
 your wedding, huh?

199
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,180
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,630
Why?

201
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,370
She wasn't happy?

202
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,660
That doesn't sound right.

203
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,480
Mom, I'll talk to you when I get home.

204
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,160
Oh, okay.

205
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,660
You must be busy. Have a good day.

206
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,430
Yeah. Okay.

207
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,000
There's no reason why 
Young Lady Min Jae would be against it.

208
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,370
My gosh.

209
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,530
I wonder why.

210
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,930
Geez...

211
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,090
Aigoo.

212
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,440
Oh, my.

213
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,530
What's this?

214
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,110
What this?

215
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,380
 Dear Mother. 

216
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,280
 I'm sorry to leave without saying goodbye. 

217
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,620
What's this?

218
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,170
Wait a minute.

219
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,500
Oh, my goodness...

220
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,910
 Ever since I was born,  

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,800
 I have never experienced the 
warmth that I felt from you, Mother. 

222
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,180
 Thank you so much for everything. 

223
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,160
 Be healthy. 

224
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,890
 From Hwang Na Ro. 

225
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,140
Gosh...

226
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,770
Na Ro...

227
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,230
 

228
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,500
  The customer is not 
answering the phone. 

229
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,330
  The customer is not 
answering the phone. 

230
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,640
Boy, the heater is turned
 up to the max...

231
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,870
Hwak Se.

232
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,120
Noonim.

233
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,050
Did Na Ro leave?

234
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,020
I think so.

235
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,590
He left me this.

236
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,740
My goodness.

237
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,710
 

238
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,240
So another word,

239
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,090
you want me to intercept this contract?

240
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,980
Yes, Chairwoman.

241
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,800
I could do it myself, but

242
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,740
I think it will be quicker with your help.

243
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,230
By chance...

244
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,860
isn't this Min Jae's son 
Woo Jae Hee's project?

245
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,800
You're right.

246
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,410
But why?

247
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,490
Jae Hee oppa is...

248
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,640
marrying Bit Chae Woon.

249
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,350
What?

250
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,980
Their relationship progressed that far?

251
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,410
Seo Ah...

252
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,040
are you trying to get back 
at Woo Jae Hee this way?

253
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,950
Don't ask any more questions.

254
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,010
Please help me, Grandma.

255
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Woo Jae Hee's company must be tiny.

256
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,180
If things go wrong,

257
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,470
you'll destroy his company.

258
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,200
It won't go down that easily.

259
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,290
I just want to scare him.

260
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,340
Since he made me cry bloody tears.

261
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,500
Aigoo, Seo Ah.

262
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,120
- But still...
- I've been...

263
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,670
hiding my feelings from
 you out of embarrassment.

264
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,790
I barely managed to open up to you.

265
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,880
I feel so wronged that 
I'm coming to you, Grandma.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,300
I know how upset you've
 been, my princess.

267
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,790
But still, this isn't right.

268
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,970
Do you think your mom will let it 
go if she ever found out?

269
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,980
What if she doesn't? What?

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,900
You know that Mom is
 always coddling Bit Chae Woon.

271
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,380
Please take my side, Grandma.

272
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,780
Please?

273
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,550
Grandma...

274
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,530
No.

275
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,290
I'll sit here.

276
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,620
You're going back to the office, right?

277
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,680
No. I have to stop by somewhere.

278
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,230
I heard you moved out 
of Samgwang Villa.

279
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,770
Stay here from now on.

280
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,300
It's okay. I have a place to stay.

281
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,090
Don't feel bad.

282
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,050
We used to use this place.

283
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,850
It's empty for now.

284
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,460
If the CEO finds out about this,

285
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,770
I don't want to be on her bad side.

286
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,420
You don't have to care about 
what my mom thinks.

287
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,700
I want to be careful about things
 I don't need to care about.

288
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,230
I want the CEO to like me
 in every way. Because...

289
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,100
she's the mother of the woman I like.

290
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,770
How is it going with 
Woo Jae Hee's contract?

291
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,310
Woo Jae Hee believes
 it's pretty much his project.

292
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,270
We just have to stab him in the back.

293
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,880
But will you really be okay?

294
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,810
If Woo Jae Hee loses this contract,

295
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,890
he can lose everything.

296
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,500
He should.

297
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,790
I'll trample on him.

298
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,030
I'll make sure he knows...

299
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,310
what he gets for 
choosing Bit Chae Woon.

300
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,780
 Jang Seo Ah, you're
 pretending to be vicious. 

301
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,570
 You'll regret this. 

302
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
What?

303
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,640
Then promise me one thing.

304
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,910
Promise?

305
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,780
After you trample on 
Woo Jae Hee this time,

306
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,000
you'll forget about him 
completely. After that,

307
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
please let me in.

308
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,800
Properly.

309
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,900
Stop rambling and do your job.

310
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,610
I'm not rambling.

311
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,790
You know...

312
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,230
that I like you, Director.

313
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,970
Is it just me?

314
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,570
 

315
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,800
First...

316
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,380
I want to test you to see if 
you still have what it takes.

317
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,820
If you pull this off,

318
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,070
I'll invest in your business.

319
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,210
Officetel contruction?

320
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,890
They're about to sign the contract.

321
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,060
Why would you be interested in this?

322
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,800
You don't need to know why.

323
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,980
Ruin that deal, and you take it over.

324
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,210
If you call these people on this card,

325
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,230
they'll be interested.

326
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,040
Of course, it's up to how well you do.

327
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,970
This isn't anything shady, is it?

328
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,030
I don't want to do it if it 
will embarrass Seo Yeon.

329
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,720
Your sheer existence is 
a nuisance to her.

330
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,230
Don't you know that yet?

331
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,050
How about the retainer?

332
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,090
It'll be deposited.

333
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,960
You think you can do it?

334
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,490
This is just a warm-up exercise.

335
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,280
Don't change your mind later.

336
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,830
Ordering materials already?

337
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,080
Yeah, we have to start construction
 as soon as we sign the contract.

338
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,040
But still. How can we 
buy the supplies already?

339
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,720
The deal isn't final yet.

340
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,160
 It's better than struggling 
to get materials later. 

341
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,560
We had such a hard time
 last time because of that.

342
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,790
Hey, don't worry.

343
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,280
Is that right?

344
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,140
Okay. Good day.

345
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,210
- What are you ordering already?
- Geez, scared me!

346
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,810
Dad, your hair.

347
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,100
- Do I look younger?
- Whoa, yes.

348
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,580
Strangers might think 
you're my older brother.

349
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,020
Come on.

350
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,130
What were you saying about 
ordering supplies already?

351
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,260
Our supplier.

352
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,900
It looks like I'll sign 
a big contract soon.

353
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,100
When it's signed, we have to 
start construction right away.

354
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,200
So you're going to jump the gun?

355
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,000
You should always look before you leap.

356
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,690
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

357
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,050
So what brings you here?

358
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,830
Your mom is against your marriage?

359
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,220
Yes.

360
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,670
She won't tell us the reason.

361
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,420
But I suspect that...

362
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,080
it might be Chae Woon's mother 
and your past relationship.

363
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,200
Our past relationship?

364
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,470
Because you and Chae Woon's 
mother dated in the past.

365
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,040
Hey, what do you mean we dated?

366
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,260
Soon Jung and I are like
 the white and clean snow

367
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,060
in the mountains of Gangwondo. 
We're pure and innocent.

368
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,170
Did your mom tell you that?

369
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,200
That I dated Soon Jung?

370
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,160
No, not exactly.

371
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,020
How about now?

372
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,250
Tell me, honestly.

373
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,880
Do you have slight feelings for her?

374
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,780
Hey, man! What slight feelings?

375
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,230
Geez, you scared me.

376
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,750
No one is in my heart.

377
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,080
In my heart, the cold wind 
of Siberia is blowing hard.

378
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,850
Cold wind?

379
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,060
Dad, are you lonely?

380
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,720
Anyway, tell your mom to stop
 with her ridiculous imagination.

381
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,350
Tell her to help you prepare
 for your wedding.

382
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,710
So why don't you meet 
Mom and talk it over?

383
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,910
Okay?

384
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm busy, so I'll get going.

385
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,980
- Hey, Woo Jae Hee.
- Yes?

386
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,160
Is there anything I should look into?

387
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,700
It looks like you have a big contract.

388
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,660
Don't worry. My preparation
 is going well.

389
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
You and I work in different fields.

390
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,940
Come on, man.

391
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,650
When it comes to stumbling and 
falling, it's all the same in all fields.

392
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,120
"It will work out. Good luck, son." 
Can't you say stuff like that?

393
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,130
You always put a damper on.

394
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,840
I'm just saying, 
be careful in everything.

395
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,850
I'm sure other people tell 
you all the good things.

396
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,980
Okay. I'm leaving, Dad.

397
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,940
Hey, you should take 
my advice to heart!

398
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,380
Geez. Geez, my mouth.

399
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,880
I could've just said, "Good luck."

400
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,380
Geez...

401
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,870
He'll do well, right?

402
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,050
Seriously, Dad.

403
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,570
Mom is totally right.

404
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,100
He's his old self with 
only Mom and me.

405
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,850
 

406
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,950
Taking over a food truck?

407
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,210
Yeah. It's pre-owned.

408
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,380
A friend of mine told me about it.

409
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,970
Call him if you're interested.

410
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,810
The owner is selling it in a rush. 
So it's priced at 40% lower.

411
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,550
40%?

412
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,410
Whoa, that's really low.

413
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,680
- It's a really good deal, isn't it?
- I know.

414
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,800
He needs a decision by tomorrow.

415
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,210
It's a good price, so there 
are lots of competitors.

416
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,810
By tomorrow?

417
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,630
Okay...

418
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,900
Bigger.

419
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,170
More, more, more.

420
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,170
So, are you going to...

421
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,230
- marry Man Jung?
- Excuse me?

422
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,810
I said, open up.

423
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,060
Okay.

424
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,230
Okay, you're done.

425
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,690
But Doctor.

426
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,550
Why did you ask if I'm going
 to marry Man Jung?

427
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,680
Well, it's just unexpected.

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,500
On the outside, Man Jung
 seems easy-going.

429
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,520
But she's very ambitious.

430
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,420
Some guys are still hitting on her.

431
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,300
Some younger hoobaes, too.

432
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,450
Oh, I see.

433
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,570
I was taken by surprise, too.

434
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,310
Despite all those rivals,

435
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,460
she likes me.

436
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,970
Yes.

437
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,160
Please go to the voice clinic.

438
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,700
- Good job.
- I know. Pretty impressive.

439
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,720
As for this, it's pretty popular.

440
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,600
Hwak Se, did you finish
 your treatment?

441
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,670
Yes.

442
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,320
How is Hwak Se's throat?

443
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,080
It's improving.

444
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,060
Oh, really? Thank you, Doctor.

445
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,540
The treatment was tough, huh?

446
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,960
No, not at all. It was quick.

447
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,380
Oh, no.

448
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,990
Jjung-a should grab 
some tea with you, but

449
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,480
I have patients to see.

450
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,470
Gosh, it's okay.

451
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,180
Hwak Se has to get back soon, too.

452
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,550
And we can drink the tea 
at home by a bucketful.

453
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,820
That's right.

454
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,300
Oh, wait.

455
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,970
You'd look pretty if you do this.

456
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,580
Jjung-a got prettier.

457
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,570
- Take your prescription.
- Okay.

458
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,100
I'll go. Bye-bye.

459
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,400
I'm off.

460
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,330
I'd like my prescription.

461
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,920
It's Kim Hwak Se.

462
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,480
Excuse me, Doctor.

463
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,330
I've felt this last time, too.

464
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,930
Do you have anything against me?

465
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,260
Yes.

466
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,750
Pardon?

467
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,570
I've been close friends with

468
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,410
Man Jung ever since our
 international high school days.

469
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,430
Of course, our Man Jung tends to be

470
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,020
blinded when she falls in love.

471
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,500
But this is too much even for her.

472
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,980
"This"?

473
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,230
What do you mean by "too much"?

474
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,560
I saw you two at our reunion, too.

475
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,610
None of us could believe 
what we saw then.

476
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,820
Geez, no matter how 
desperate she is,

477
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,030
- how could she...
- Doctor.

478
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,700
What do you know about me
 to say stuff like that?

479
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,200
What?

480
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,670
Well, I mean, I'm sure you
 know a lot about my throat.

481
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,110
But what kind of person I am

482
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,110
or what part of me did 
Man Jung fall for...

483
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,840
You have no idea.

484
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,960
Man Jung introduced you to me, 
saying what a great doctor you are.

485
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,110
But to look down on me when 
Man Jung isn't around is...

486
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,120
This is wrong.

487
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,990
I thought you were 
Man Jung's good friend.

488
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,370
What did I say?

489
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,110
I just find it ridiculous...

490
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,100
What's so ridiculous?

491
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,830
Because I'm not a doctor like you?

492
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,960
Or because I don't have 
a successful career?

493
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,970
Or because I'm a third-rate singer?

494
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,820
Doctor.

495
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,800
You're a successful doctor.

496
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,310
But you've never been
 loved by Man Jung.

497
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,200
You have no idea how
 blissful that is.

498
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,350
I feel like I'm flying the sky every day.

499
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,280
Even though I'm a third-rate singer,

500
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,470
I receive abundant love
 from Man Jung. So...

501
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,230
don't look down on me again.

502
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,870
If I'm offended every time
 I come in for treatment,

503
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,190
I don't think my throat will heal well.

504
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,720
I'll fly away now...

505
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,980
Man Jung.

506
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,680
Did you really do that?

507
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,930
No, I didn't say much...

508
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,330
Wait, what are you doing?

509
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,560
Wait. Let's just go.

510
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,690
Wait.

511
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,670
I came to get a book over there.

512
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,280
Hey, Lee Man Jung.

513
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,300
Take that. How dare you.

514
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,230
Hwak Se, I'm sorry.

515
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,770
I didn't know that moron 
was treating you like that.

516
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,030
I beat that doctor.

517
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,190
Did you see?

518
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,680
Did you see him look down like this?

519
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,900
Yeah, I did. You won.

520
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,850
You won. You won.

521
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,090
Don't worry about me anymore.

522
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,700
I won't be intimidated anymore.

523
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,510
I won. You saw that, right?

524
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,050
- You saw, right?
- I did. I saw.

525
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,860
You did great! Kim Hwak Se, 
I'm proud of you.

526
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,580
You did great!

527
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,690
I love you, Jjung-a.

528
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,800
Me, too. I love you so much.

529
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,820
So proud of you.

530
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,280
When I was talking to him,

531
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,680
he was like this. Right?

532
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,970
Yeah, yeah. He was scared
 and looked down.

533
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,300
I almost butt his head.

534
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,540
 Chae Woon, Na Ro moved 
out of Samgwang Villa. 

535
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,800
 Soon Jung noonim is so disappointed. 

536
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,260
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

537
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,050
Bit Chae Woon.

538
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,430
How is your wedding preparation going?

539
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,180
I haven't started yet.

540
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,560
Is it still on?

541
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,810
Yes.

542
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,500
Hwang Na Ro.

543
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,650
I heard you moved out 
of Samgwang Villa.

544
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,210
Since you wanted me to.

545
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,910
Aren't you happy?

546
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,840
Now that I'm out of there?

547
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,150
I heard my mom is very sad.

548
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,980
Don't be too happy that I moved out.

549
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,780
Whenever I get too happy,

550
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,240
something bad always follows after.

551
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,630
Yes, sir.

552
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,390
We'll begin construction as soon
 as we sign the contract.

553
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,150
Don't worry, sir.

554
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,390
Yes. Don't worry.

555
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,990
Oh, Mr. Lee. Just a moment.

556
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,900
Yes, sir. I'll call you again.

557
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,230
Yes. Okay.

558
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,710
I guess Mr. Woo isn't in?

559
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,880
He's at the site.

560
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,310
Oh, I see.

561
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,230
He's a busy man.

562
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,770
I left some of my things, 
so I came to pick them up.

563
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,180
- I put them here.
- Oh, really?

564
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,500
This is my favorite thing.

565
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,480
Whoa. Mr. Lee. You look great today.

566
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,140
Really?

567
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,590
Mr. Woo and his girlfriend 
are doing well, right?

568
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,990
Yes, of course.

569
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,900
I think they'll get married soon.

570
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,490
- Is that right?
- Yes.

571
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,240
Of course, director.

572
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,500
It's a great item.

573
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,170
I have a big investor, too.

574
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,220
I'll see you one of these days.

575
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,700
Bit Chae Woon.

576
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,370
Look at you.

577
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,960
Give it to me.

578
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,660
I told you not to cut off contact.

579
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,130
Why didn't you keep the promise?

580
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,730
Did you start a business?

581
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,170
Who is the big investor?

582
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,530
Mr. Woo.

583
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,960
Give me my phone.

584
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,290
Then don't cut off contact.

585
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,780
Give me the phone.

586
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,450
Do you know how upset Chae Woon is?

587
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,780
You said you want to be 
a good father to Chae Woon.

588
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,990
Don't cut off contact.

589
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,760
Discuss everything with me
 if something comes up.

590
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,910
All right.

591
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,750
Let's meet up with Chae Woon together.

592
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,090
Give her some confidence
 so that she won't be anxious.

593
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,250
Not yet.

594
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,010
After I get back on my feet again.

595
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,080
How will you do that?

596
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,500
I said, discuss everything with me.

597
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,410
You take care of your own stuff.

598
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,310
I hope your contract comes through.

599
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,800
From what I found out, you accumulated 
quite a debt doing business.

600
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,040
I don't like Seo Yeon marrying 
someone with lots of debt.

601
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,910
I heard you're going to 
marry Seo Yeon soon.

602
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,900
Did Mr. Yoo tell you?

603
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,140
Yeah.

604
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,000
Geez, that Mr. Yoo...

605
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Don't worry about me. 
Worry about yourself, sir.

606
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,100
Rather than "sir," how about
 you call me "father"?

607
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,370
I can't.

608
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,390
Not until Chae Woon approves.

609
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,940
Then...

610
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,240
bye-bye.

611
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,040
Don't change your number. Okay?

612
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,050
Or I'll get furious.

613
00:34:13,446 --> 00:34:16,296
Pil Hong hyung sure is 
getting involved on his own.

614
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:23,106
Your daughter might not be able
 to get married because of you.

615
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:24,796
What are you going to do?

616
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:35,846
 What if I run into Mom or Seo Ah at LX? 

617
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:38,186
 I always bump into 
someone when I go there. 

618
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:42,256
Mr. Makjang! Don't just 
sit there. Help me out.

619
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:43,616
The chief there said

620
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:46,536
to bring our styling portfolio.

621
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:48,696
 If she finds out I'm 
CEO Kim Jung Won's son, 

622
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:51,486
 she won't want to work with me. 

623
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:53,296
Mr. Makjang!

624
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:58,576
- Hey!
- Scared me.

625
00:34:58,576 --> 00:34:59,836
What are you thinking about?

626
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:02,566
You know about our 
meeting at LX today?

627
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:04,286
I think you should go there alone.

628
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:05,556
Why?

629
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:09,576
I... I have something to
 take care of here.

630
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:12,646
What's there to take care of? 
We have no orders.

631
00:35:12,646 --> 00:35:15,806
Come on, get up. I'm not confident 
enough to go there alone.

632
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:18,746
Hey. Why are you not 
confident as a young person?

633
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:21,456
Be confident. Got that?

634
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:24,666
Mr. Makjang, if you keep doing this, 
I won't work with you anymore.

635
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,916
Now that I know I'm talented in styling,

636
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,066
I'll look for another job.

637
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,086
- Are you okay with that?
- No.

638
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,526
Then get up.

639
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:34,366
If we decided to get on the same boat,

640
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,276
we should work together to the end.

641
00:35:39,186 --> 00:35:40,736
Are you mad?

642
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,056
Yes.

643
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,836
Hold this.

644
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:46,736
I should hold it. Should I carry all this?

645
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:48,196
Of course. Would I?

646
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:49,676
I should carry them.

647
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:57,126
Yes. Fine. Let's go head-on.

648
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:01,146
How does she expect me to
 carry all this? Hae Deun...

649
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:02,716
 

650
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:05,326
I came while you're busy, huh?

651
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:06,976
No.

652
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:09,876
Jung Min Jae is welcome any time.

653
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,876
You heard about
 Chae Woon and Jae Hee...

654
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:15,276
I heard.

655
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:19,656
Actually, I wanted to meet you 
and discuss that with you.

656
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:22,526
- About their marriage...
- Actually...

657
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:27,656
I told them not to rush into marriage.

658
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,496
You did?

659
00:36:30,496 --> 00:36:33,676
I thought you'd be the
 happiest out of all of us.

660
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,086
Why?

661
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:38,446
You don't like my Chae Woon?

662
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:43,116
Actually, you can't find a girl like 
Chae Woon as a daughter-in-law.

663
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:45,356
Oh, hey.

664
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:48,966
You indeed are 
Chae Woon's birth mom.

665
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:51,296
You're in mother mode.

666
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,576
Hey, girl. You're in 
a total mother-in-law mode.

667
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:57,286
Oh, my. Jung Won, you're so sassy.

668
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:59,236
It's been a while. Good to see you.

669
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:04,006
I really like Chae Woon.

670
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:06,846
I'd want her as my daughter 
rather than a daughter-in-law.

671
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,736
But...

672
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:11,476
But?

673
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:16,546
There's something you must 
do before they get married.

674
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:17,956
What?

675
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:22,786
Filing Bit Chae Woon 
as your daughter on paper.

676
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,126
You bring that up, too.

677
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:28,216
Oh, my.

678
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:31,886
Did Soon Jung bring this up, too?

679
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,206
Of course...

680
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:37,566
 Soon Jung is considering her
 future with Woo Jung Hoo? 

681
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:40,306
I discussed it with Soon Jung, too.

682
00:37:40,306 --> 00:37:43,026
For now, considering
 the situation at work,

683
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,686
I can't put her down 
as my daughter yet.

684
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:47,606
Why? Why can't you?

685
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:49,146
She's your real daughter.

686
00:37:49,146 --> 00:37:50,506
Min Jae.

687
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:54,516
If you say this, too, I just can't...

688
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:59,436
Right. You must be 
struggling over this, too.

689
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:01,136
What can I do?

690
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:04,606
Let's postpone their wedding
 until the paperwork is taken care of.

691
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:08,786
What does the paperwork 
and their getting married

692
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,666
have to do with anything?

693
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:13,576
You also know that

694
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:17,626
Woo Jung Hoo and Soon Jung 
were their first loves, right?

695
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:18,936
Of course, I know.

696
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:22,976
And what? Are you upset 
about that now?

697
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,656
No.

698
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:27,596
I want those two to be together.

699
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:30,416
What are you talking about?

700
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,816
Hey.

701
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:34,446
Are they dating or something?

702
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:37,016
No, no. It's not like that.

703
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:38,636
It's just me.

704
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:42,076
I thought it'd be nice if 
they were good friends.

705
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:44,476
But if we were in-laws, 
that'd be difficult.

706
00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:46,216
Hey, Jung Min Jae.

707
00:38:46,216 --> 00:38:48,396
Aren't you getting way 
ahead of yourself?

708
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:51,156
Jung Hoo and Soon Jung
 wouldn't do that.

709
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:54,326
Are there specific types 
of people who do that?

710
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:56,536
They wouldn't be able to get
 together on their own.

711
00:38:56,536 --> 00:38:59,286
I'm just saying let's set
 the stage for them.

712
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:03,066
Jung Min Jae, you're way
 ahead of yourself.

713
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:04,586
I think you're overreacting.

714
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:07,416
No, I'm not overreacting. I'm serious.

715
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:11,566
Are you here to play? 
Are you filming a movie?

716
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:13,136
What's with your sunglasses?

717
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:15,076
Why did you stand up your collar?

718
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:16,926
It's there so that I can stand it up.

719
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:18,196
Do you even know the style?

720
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:20,136
Be quiet. Hush.

721
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:23,036
Hae Deun, when we work with them,

722
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:24,446
let's just put your name down.

723
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,176
I'll just support you in the background.

724
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:27,536
Why?

725
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:29,316
What do you mean, why?

726
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:32,486
I'm leading a business.

727
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:35,486
This is a freelance project.

728
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:36,976
Please.

729
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:38,436
Let's do that.

730
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,806
Joon Ah!

731
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:45,086
I knew this would happen.
 I knew I'd bump into someone.

732
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:46,576
It's Mr. Woo's mother.

733
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:47,766
Hello.

734
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,606
Hae Deun.

735
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:51,226
You two are here together.

736
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:52,596
What brings you here?

737
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:54,636
I'm here for work.

738
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:56,726
I see.

739
00:39:57,576 --> 00:40:00,926
Hey, do you have a sty in your eye? 
What's with your sunglasses?

740
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:02,946
Yes, yes...

741
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:05,656
Well, I'm friends with Jae Hee.

742
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,376
I'm close to his mother, too.

743
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:09,046
Oh, I know.

744
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:11,456
You heard, right?

745
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,916
Mr. Woo and my sister.

746
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,476
Yeah. I heard.

747
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:19,126
I guess the whole family knows 
about their plan to get married?

748
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,236
Yes.

749
00:40:20,236 --> 00:40:23,166
Please take good care of 
my sister in the future.

750
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,776
In-law.

751
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:26,896
- In-law...
- In-law?

752
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:27,946
Yeah.

753
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:30,056
Is Jae Hee getting married?

754
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:34,256
Hae Deun, it's a bit 
premature to call me in-law.

755
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,576
Oh, am I too old-fashioned?

756
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:38,376
Get to work.

757
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,746
Okay, be careful going home, ma'am.

758
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,706
Ma'am?

759
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,186
Ma'am, please go home.

760
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:45,226
- Let's go.
- Hey!

761
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:46,956
Sorry.

762
00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:47,956
- Joon Ah...
- Goodbye.

763
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:50,176
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

764
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,136
Is Jae Hee really getting married?

765
00:40:52,136 --> 00:40:54,266
Yeah. They already have rings.

766
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:56,326
Wow, what's my sister going to do?

767
00:40:56,326 --> 00:40:58,626
- Huh? What about your sister?
- What, what?

768
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,576
Why did you hear that?

769
00:41:00,576 --> 00:41:03,496
It's about time my sister
 gets married, too.

770
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:06,316
Let's not stand here in the center
 like this. Let's go over there.

771
00:41:06,316 --> 00:41:07,896
I like the center.

772
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:10,136
Are you an idol or something? 
Liking center...

773
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:13,046
Here are evaluations for design interns.

774
00:41:13,046 --> 00:41:16,396
I have to announce interns 
who will be hired full-time.

775
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:21,856
Kim Dae Won and Lee Bit Chae Woon...

776
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,226
are tied?

777
00:41:24,226 --> 00:41:25,776
Yes.

778
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,036
It was tough to figure out who's better.

779
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:32,206
I'd like you to decide personally.

780
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:36,616
Bit Chae Woon won the design contest.

781
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:40,786
I thought she was also ahead of 
Kim Dae Won for internship scoring.

782
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:42,886
She was until midterm.

783
00:41:42,886 --> 00:41:46,706
But Kim Dae Won started to stand 
out in various ways recently.

784
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:50,396
And the mistake that Bit Chae Woon
 made during the styling class

785
00:41:50,396 --> 00:41:53,136
is reflected in the review.

786
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:55,826
I got it. I'll review them.

787
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,486
You know that there are 
still rumors about

788
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:02,396
Bit Chae Won, right?

789
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:07,556
Director Jang keeps checking 
on the matter as well.

790
00:42:08,556 --> 00:42:09,976
All right then.

791
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:13,056
Director Jang.

792
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:16,326
Yes.

793
00:42:17,486 --> 00:42:21,946
What's the reason 
you're making me pick

794
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:25,316
one of these people?

795
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:28,566
You know already.

796
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:34,676
It would be nice if you were calm 
and collected as a boss to everyone.

797
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:50,256
The job for you is to stylize and 
take photos of our online content.

798
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,626
It won't be much different from 
what you've been doing.

799
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:54,626
Oh, okay. We'll do our best.

800
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:56,086
I look forward to it.

801
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:58,646
But who is this...

802
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:00,656
Oh, yes.

803
00:43:00,656 --> 00:43:03,246
He's extremely shy.

804
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,946
You should say hi.

805
00:43:04,946 --> 00:43:06,606
Hello.

806
00:43:06,606 --> 00:43:11,416
Oh, your name is stylist 
Lee Hae Deun and...

807
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:14,566
- he's...
- He's our CEO.

808
00:43:14,566 --> 00:43:17,016
- His name is Jang...
- Hey, you.

809
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:19,746
It's Jang Val Jean.

810
00:43:19,746 --> 00:43:20,786
What?

811
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:22,026
Jang Val Jean.

812
00:43:22,026 --> 00:43:23,796
He's joking.

813
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:25,906
He lived overseas for a long time.

814
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:27,486
His name is Mark Jang.

815
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:28,706
Mark Jang.

816
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,706
Chief, I brought the samples.

817
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:33,066
- Thank you.
- Unni!

818
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:35,036
Lee Hae Deun.

819
00:43:35,036 --> 00:43:37,356
 What? That's Lee Bit Chae Woon? 

820
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:39,616
Are you Bit Chae Woon's sister?

821
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:40,666
Yes.

822
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:42,476
Bit Chae Woon, you didn't know?

823
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:45,246
The person joining our online 
photography team is you?

824
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:47,256
The CEO and me.

825
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:51,646
I contacted her after seeing how
 stylish her online shopping mall was.

826
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:53,646
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

827
00:43:53,646 --> 00:43:56,036
I was shy and...

828
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:57,476
I thought I might put you on the spot.

829
00:43:57,476 --> 00:43:59,196
What are you saying? This is great.

830
00:44:01,586 --> 00:44:03,906
You two must be meeting 
for the first time.

831
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:06,746
He's my CEO and Mr. Woo's friend.

832
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:08,596
It's my sister. Say hi.

833
00:44:08,596 --> 00:44:10,676
 His friend, Joon Ah? 

834
00:44:10,676 --> 00:44:12,426
Hello.

835
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:15,486
Mr. Woo's friend.

836
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,786
Yeah.

837
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:20,326
Thank you.

838
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:23,016
Sit.

839
00:44:24,946 --> 00:44:26,696
I finally meet you now.

840
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:28,046
I know.

841
00:44:28,046 --> 00:44:30,066
Hello, it's nice to meet you. 
I'm Jang Joon Ah.

842
00:44:31,576 --> 00:44:34,746
I went home to say hi last time.

843
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,256
But you weren't there. You had 
gone back to where you lived before.

844
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:39,996
Yes.

845
00:44:39,996 --> 00:44:42,356
I had a situation.

846
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:47,296
You must've struggled 
a lot because of Seo Ah.

847
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:54,446
So no one knows that 
you're the CEO's son?

848
00:44:54,446 --> 00:44:56,506
Yes. Not yet.

849
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:58,016
Hae Deun doesn't know, either.

850
00:44:58,016 --> 00:45:00,076
I thought she'd feel 
uncomfortable if she found out.

851
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:01,586
And it seems like...

852
00:45:01,586 --> 00:45:04,826
Hae Deun doesn't really 
care for my mom.

853
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:13,866
I heard that you went to 
London to study.

854
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:15,406
London...

855
00:45:15,406 --> 00:45:18,486
London... Well, I...

856
00:45:18,486 --> 00:45:22,036
didn't really want to work 
at the company

857
00:45:22,036 --> 00:45:24,096
so I just took off.

858
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,886
And for some reason, I'm back here.

859
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,806
I always like styling.

860
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:32,856
I'll work with Hae Deun a bit,

861
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:36,106
and I'll get back to what I was 
doing before when the contract ends.

862
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:37,636
Oh,  yes.

863
00:45:37,636 --> 00:45:41,266
Then I won't tell the CEO for now.

864
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:44,656
- Also, to employees.
- Yes, thank you.

865
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,706
Later on...

866
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:51,086
just tell them... when you're 
comfortable, Joon Ah.

867
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:53,256
Yes, I should.

868
00:45:56,786 --> 00:45:58,216
Joon Ah...

869
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:04,176
Why are they talking so long? 
They just met.

870
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:05,856
I'm curious.

871
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:09,996
Yes?

872
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:15,706
Welcome.

873
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,006
Did you ask for me?

874
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:22,766
You must be busy.

875
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:24,966
Working on new product development.

876
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:26,426
You're working hard.

877
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:28,526
Sit down. Let's have some tea.

878
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:29,796
Okay.

879
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:34,376
The intern evaluation is finalized.

880
00:46:35,266 --> 00:46:36,756
Ah, yes.

881
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:41,316
Is it okay for you to tell me first?

882
00:46:41,316 --> 00:46:43,556
I need to...

883
00:46:43,556 --> 00:46:47,106
ask for your understanding.

884
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:50,836
Unfortunately, Kim Dae Won and you...

885
00:46:50,836 --> 00:46:53,136
have the same score.

886
00:46:53,136 --> 00:46:54,866
We're tied?

887
00:46:55,876 --> 00:47:00,156
I thought I'd have a higher score.

888
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:03,096
So...

889
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:08,796
as the CEO, I have to choose one of you.

890
00:47:12,216 --> 00:47:13,656
Then...

891
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:17,766
what you mean by asking for 
my understanding means...

892
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,926
Because I'm your daughter?

893
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,296
Because managing directors 
are watching suspiciously

894
00:47:28,296 --> 00:47:30,926
and your position is unstable?

895
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:33,676
Seo Yeon.

896
00:47:36,296 --> 00:47:40,116
Do I have to give up so much 
to be your daughter?

897
00:47:41,146 --> 00:47:44,046
But this isn't about that.

898
00:47:44,046 --> 00:47:46,766
I didn't come into this 
company with your help.

899
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:49,866
I entered the contest four
 times and finally made it.

900
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,636
Even that, Seo Ah canceled 
my grand prize

901
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,086
so I had to go through hurdles. But...

902
00:47:56,026 --> 00:48:00,836
must I accept another unfair treatment?

903
00:48:04,796 --> 00:48:07,166
Seo Yeon, instead...

904
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:10,766
how about you go study overseas?

905
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:13,656
I'll support you in
 whatever way you want.

906
00:48:13,656 --> 00:48:18,776
After you come back, I'll set it up, 
so you can work as my daughter.

907
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:24,056
In return, I'd like you to
 give me some time.

908
00:48:24,056 --> 00:48:25,486
No.

909
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,586
That's not what I want.

910
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:33,286
I just want to be acknowledged
 here for my abilities.

911
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:36,236
I'm not your daughter out in the open.

912
00:48:36,236 --> 00:48:39,856
I can't be acknowledged 
as your daughter for a while.

913
00:48:40,976 --> 00:48:43,446
I can't let this happen 
as far as work, either.

914
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:47,916
It's not something I give into. 
No, I don't want to. I can't.

915
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,276
Seo Yeon.

916
00:48:50,276 --> 00:48:53,616
But still, you're my daughter.

917
00:48:53,616 --> 00:48:56,946
You know how things are here.

918
00:48:56,946 --> 00:48:59,906
That's why I'm asking you shamelessly

919
00:48:59,906 --> 00:49:03,106
for your understanding.

920
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,906
Then what can I do as your daughter?

921
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,926
What are some possible things 
because I'm your daughter?

922
00:49:17,096 --> 00:49:20,646
I think it's better not to be acknowledged
 as your daughter at this rate.

923
00:49:21,686 --> 00:49:23,866
Although I can't be 
accepted as your daughter,

924
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:25,586
I'd rather go back to before

925
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:28,756
and be confident about my
 abilities as Lee Bit Chae Woon

926
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:30,616
and get what I deserve.

927
00:49:33,546 --> 00:49:36,476
I so looked forward to 
meeting my birth mom.

928
00:49:38,656 --> 00:49:41,236
But I think I had it better before.

929
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:46,796
I guess so.

930
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,736
I'm sorry.

931
00:49:51,736 --> 00:49:53,466
No.

932
00:49:54,396 --> 00:49:56,356
What you said is correct.

933
00:49:57,516 --> 00:49:59,756
I think I only considered

934
00:50:00,726 --> 00:50:03,176
my position and my situation.

935
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:06,706
I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

936
00:50:08,156 --> 00:50:09,836
No.

937
00:50:09,836 --> 00:50:11,996
What you said is right.

938
00:50:11,996 --> 00:50:14,056
Do what you need to do.

939
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:17,726
I'll quit my job.

940
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,236
Even if I have to work for 
a small company,

941
00:50:20,236 --> 00:50:23,786
I'll work for a place where 
my ability is appreciated.

942
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:26,036
No, Seo Yeon. Don't do that.

943
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:29,296
- Don't do that.
- I'm sorry.

944
00:50:34,756 --> 00:50:36,326
Seo Yeon.

945
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:37,056
♫  It's good  ♫

946
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:40,706
♫  It's very, very good  ♫

947
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,056
Hwak Se.

948
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:43,166
Aigoo, Eems hyung.

949
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:45,966
Your hair...

950
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:47,666
Wow!

951
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:48,786
What do you think?

952
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,476
Gosh, you look great, Eems hyung.

953
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:53,696
People would believe it 
if we said we're friends.

954
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:54,956
Gosh, Hwak Se.

955
00:51:54,956 --> 00:51:56,806
Wow, it's good to see you, my friend.

956
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:00,886
So, can you sing now?

957
00:52:00,886 --> 00:52:02,226
Your throat was feeling bad.

958
00:52:02,226 --> 00:52:04,366
My throat wasn't well, but

959
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:06,166
I got better after some treatment.

960
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,796
I see.

961
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:10,986
Eems hyung, this is a secret.

962
00:52:12,386 --> 00:52:15,666
 
I'm going to enter this radio singing contest.

963
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,006
Whoa!

964
00:52:17,006 --> 00:52:19,796
Hwak Se, good job.

965
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:23,456
It's better to run toward a clear goal.

966
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:25,566
You'll do great, Hwak Se.

967
00:52:25,566 --> 00:52:28,256
Gosh, thank you, Eems hyung.

968
00:52:28,256 --> 00:52:29,646
Thank you.

969
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:33,056
Aigoo, Noonim. Hello.

970
00:52:33,056 --> 00:52:34,926
Hello.

971
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:37,886
Honey, your hair...

972
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,356
What do you think?

973
00:52:43,136 --> 00:52:46,286
Who do you need to impress 
that you colored your hair?

974
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:47,656
What?

975
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:53,986
Eems hyung wants to be my friend, so

976
00:52:53,986 --> 00:52:56,866
he colored his hair.
 Isn't that right, Eems hyung?

977
00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:03,036
What brings you here, Noonim?

978
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:04,496
Did you come to meet Eems hyung?

979
00:53:04,496 --> 00:53:06,546
No, I'm here to see Soon Jung.

980
00:53:06,546 --> 00:53:08,436
I see. To meet my noonim...

981
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,816
Oh, I guess you'll be Bit Chae's...

982
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:14,786
mother-in-law.

983
00:53:14,786 --> 00:53:16,446
What?

984
00:53:18,216 --> 00:53:20,906
I guess that makes you father-in-law?

985
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:23,366
Is that so?

986
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,786
Yes, of course.

987
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,516
Please take good care of our Bit Chae.

988
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:29,646
Yes, Hwak Se.

989
00:53:30,776 --> 00:53:33,896
Nothing's been decided. 
Why is everyone...

990
00:53:35,886 --> 00:53:37,076
Excuse me?

991
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,536
Jung Min Jae.

992
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:46,506
See me for  a minute.

993
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:49,876
I have to take care of something.

994
00:53:49,876 --> 00:53:50,856
Later.

995
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:52,026
Good night.

996
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:53,776
Thank you. Good evening.

997
00:53:59,266 --> 00:54:00,726
Eems hyungnim.

998
00:54:01,876 --> 00:54:04,046
I feel like Noonim

999
00:54:04,046 --> 00:54:08,026
doesn't seem happy about Bit Chae 
and Mr. Woo's marriage.

1000
00:54:09,776 --> 00:54:11,556
I'm not sure.

1001
00:54:12,746 --> 00:54:15,836
Since you don't like ginger tea, 
I prepared sikhae.

1002
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,266
Thank you.

1003
00:54:23,036 --> 00:54:24,456
Well...

1004
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:29,066
you heard that Bit Chae Woon 
and Jae Hee visited me, right?

1005
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,556
Yes.

1006
00:54:31,316 --> 00:54:35,616
I got so curious that 
I asked Chae Woon earlier.

1007
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:38,676
Then...

1008
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:44,336
you must've heard that I didn't 
give them a full blessing.

1009
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,506
Excuse me?

1010
00:54:47,346 --> 00:54:49,526
You did?

1011
00:54:49,526 --> 00:54:52,976
I haven't heard all that yet...

1012
00:54:52,976 --> 00:54:56,046
Then are you against them?

1013
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:58,326
No, it's not like that.

1014
00:54:58,326 --> 00:55:00,046
Well...

1015
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,646
I want to postpone my decision.

1016
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:06,506
But why?

1017
00:55:07,796 --> 00:55:09,586
Actually...

1018
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:14,846
it's because of you and Woo Jung Hoo.

1019
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:16,366
What?

1020
00:55:17,456 --> 00:55:18,926
Well...

1021
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:23,846
even though it's late, I wish 
you and Woo Jung Hoo

1022
00:55:23,846 --> 00:55:27,446
can have a good relationship.

1023
00:55:28,376 --> 00:55:29,736
Gosh.

1024
00:55:29,736 --> 00:55:32,276
I mean, that's...

1025
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:34,386
That's not it.

1026
00:55:34,386 --> 00:55:39,176
I'm not saying you should
 remarry or something.

1027
00:55:39,176 --> 00:55:44,396
I just thought it'd be nice if
 you two were close friends.

1028
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:49,716
You two were your first
 loves a long time ago.

1029
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:51,296
My gosh.

1030
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:55,136
That's a huge misunderstanding.

1031
00:55:56,806 --> 00:55:58,776
Well, of course...

1032
00:55:58,776 --> 00:56:01,896
Mr. Woo is a really good man.

1033
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:06,546
He did comfort me a lot 
when I struggled.

1034
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:10,186
Gosh, because of that, I don't think...

1035
00:56:10,186 --> 00:56:14,746
we should oppose 
our children's marriage.

1036
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:19,376
For now, I want to open 
the door to its potential.

1037
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,296
Not as difficult in-laws, but

1038
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:25,506
as good friends. 
Someone you can depend on.

1039
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:29,896
I'd like to postpone my decision
 until Bit Chae Woon is

1040
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:33,906
registered as Jung Won's 
daughter on paper.

1041
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:35,766
My goodness.

1042
00:56:36,746 --> 00:56:40,556
I'm so stunned.

1043
00:56:40,556 --> 00:56:43,396
I don't know what to say.

1044
00:56:44,176 --> 00:56:45,746
Soon Jung.

1045
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:47,286
I know...

1046
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:50,786
how much you two...

1047
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:54,946
really loved each other 
a long time ago.

1048
00:56:56,316 --> 00:57:00,566
And I know I split you two
 up out of jealousy.

1049
00:57:01,716 --> 00:57:05,386
And I forced Woo Jung Hoo
 to marry me.

1050
00:57:05,386 --> 00:57:08,976
That's why our marriage 
wasn't a happy one

1051
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:11,656
and ended up getting a divorce.

1052
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:15,856
There were times when
 I blamed Woo Jung Hoo, but

1053
00:57:15,856 --> 00:57:20,036
actually, I pity him.

1054
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:23,886
If he had married 
a woman he truly loved,

1055
00:57:23,886 --> 00:57:26,376
he wouldn't have turned out so mean.

1056
00:57:29,056 --> 00:57:31,916
Gosh, this is so...

1057
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:33,946
This is wrong.

1058
00:57:33,946 --> 00:57:35,406
You misunderstood.

1059
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:39,996
Mr. Woo loved you, Young Lady.

1060
00:57:39,996 --> 00:57:42,196
I know that.

1061
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:48,866
And...

1062
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:52,326
I brought this back.

1063
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:58,536
You knew I took it, huh?

1064
00:58:02,066 --> 00:58:03,826
This is how I am.

1065
00:58:03,826 --> 00:58:08,376
I get so jealous at my age.

1066
00:58:11,996 --> 00:58:16,276
The fact that you're
 still jealous means

1067
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:19,606
you still have feelings

1068
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:21,946
for Mr. Woo.

1069
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:23,136
Oh, my.

1070
00:58:23,136 --> 00:58:25,966
No. No, no.

1071
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:28,066
Rather than jealousy,

1072
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:32,416
it's just that my old feelings remain.

1073
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:33,946
It's not that.

1074
00:58:33,946 --> 00:58:38,016
I'm so sorry I took this 
without saying a word.

1075
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:48,066
 

1076
00:58:58,526 --> 00:59:00,436
"Jealousy.

1077
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:05,616
When someone you like
 likes someone else,

1078
00:59:05,616 --> 00:59:07,826
it's the feeling of hatred
 toward that person."

1079
00:59:11,076 --> 00:59:13,346
Young Lady Min Jae?

1080
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:19,256
♫  Whether you're happy or sad  ♫

1081
00:59:19,276 --> 00:59:22,776
Jung Hoo oppa gave you 
that dictionary, huh?

1082
00:59:22,776 --> 00:59:24,906
Young Lady Min Jae.

1083
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:28,866
I'll buy you a better dictionary.

1084
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,456
Give me that one.

1085
00:59:31,726 --> 00:59:33,396
It's okay.

1086
00:59:33,396 --> 00:59:35,166
I'm fine with this one.

1087
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:37,336
Then I'll give you money.

1088
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:38,576
Twice the amount?

1089
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,046
Three times the amount?

1090
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:43,226
♫  I will handle it with care  ♫

1091
00:59:43,226 --> 00:59:45,426
Then give me that one.

1092
00:59:45,426 --> 00:59:47,246
I'll give it back to you.

1093
00:59:48,326 --> 00:59:51,016
 
I have to go grocery shopping.

1094
00:59:51,016 --> 00:59:52,396
Give it to me for a minute.

1095
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:53,816
I'll give it right back.

1096
00:59:53,816 --> 00:59:55,476
I'm sorry, Young Lady.

1097
00:59:56,646 --> 00:59:58,266
Hey, Lee Soon Jung!

1098
00:59:58,266 --> 01:00:00,246
I said, let me just take a look!

1099
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:01,366
Hey!

1100
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:02,756
Geez, seriously!

1101
01:00:04,256 --> 01:00:06,056
My goodness...

1102
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:08,476
Young Lady Min Jae...

1103
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:12,666
But this is bad.

1104
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:15,486
How could she think that?

1105
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:20,236
♫  You're the only one   ♫

1106
01:00:20,256 --> 01:00:26,556
♫  You're the only one I can 
give you my whole heart  ♫

1107
01:00:26,616 --> 01:00:29,096
Goodbye. Come again.

1108
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:32,186
Ms. Lee.

1109
01:00:32,186 --> 01:00:33,796
Mr. Woo.

1110
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,746
You look wonderful.

1111
01:00:35,746 --> 01:00:37,566
You look like a young man.

1112
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:39,616
Gosh, thank you.

1113
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,956
What brings you here?

1114
01:00:41,956 --> 01:00:43,556
Come in.

1115
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:50,446
That's nonsense.

1116
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,986
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

1117
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:57,746
Young Lady Min Jae is still so cute.

1118
01:00:57,756 --> 01:01:01,656
Cute? She's still childish.

1119
01:01:03,756 --> 01:01:05,356
But still...

1120
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:11,526
you're the only one who can clear up 
her misunderstanding.

1121
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:15,226
Well...

1122
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:18,116
I don't know how to bring it up with her.

1123
01:01:18,116 --> 01:01:22,426
Can't you just be honest with her?

1124
01:01:22,426 --> 01:01:26,626
Just tell her how much 
you still care for her.

1125
01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:29,356
Gosh, no.

1126
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:33,216
Min Jae and I already...

1127
01:01:33,216 --> 01:01:35,416
ended our relationship.

1128
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:41,336
Min Jae should look for 
her happiness now.

1129
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:47,516
I think you two can be happy together.

1130
01:01:47,516 --> 01:01:53,036
I felt that coming from both of you.

1131
01:01:53,036 --> 01:01:56,866
You both love each other.

1132
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:04,246
Mr. Woo, be courageous.

1133
01:02:04,256 --> 01:02:07,956
You said that to me last time. 
To be courageous.

1134
01:02:09,006 --> 01:02:11,916
It's your turn, Mr. Woo.

1135
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:18,986
Yes. I'll talk to Min Jae.

1136
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:21,506
Gosh. In any case...

1137
01:02:21,506 --> 01:02:24,176
I can't believe she paired us up.

1138
01:02:24,176 --> 01:02:26,476
Min Jae is so mean.

1139
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,436
I know.

1140
01:02:54,196 --> 01:02:55,766
Who's this?

1141
01:02:55,766 --> 01:02:58,766
Who displays affections like this?

1142
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:04,136
I'm sorry to display my affection.

1143
01:03:04,136 --> 01:03:06,906
How can you do this now 
that Mr. Yoo isn't around?

1144
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:09,066
Where is Mr. Yoo?

1145
01:03:09,066 --> 01:03:11,206
There must be so much to do since
 it's the last day before the bidding.

1146
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:13,076
Mr. Yoo went to the warehouse

1147
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:15,476
to check the supplies. He'll be back.

1148
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,416
I'll help you.

1149
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:27,516
Something's wrong, huh?

1150
01:03:28,556 --> 01:03:29,856
Huh?

1151
01:03:31,066 --> 01:03:33,246
Your eyebrow...

1152
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,646
signals, "Something is wrong."

1153
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,216
You're psychic.

1154
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:39,446
Because of my mom 
opposing our marriage?

1155
01:03:40,186 --> 01:03:43,476
I'm thinking of leaving
 the CEO's company.

1156
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:45,036
What?

1157
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:49,466
You won't get hired full-time?

1158
01:03:49,466 --> 01:03:53,436
I said all kinds of things to the CEO
 earlier because I got so upset.

1159
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:56,496
But it bothers me.

1160
01:03:56,496 --> 01:03:58,576
That's understandable.

1161
01:03:58,576 --> 01:04:01,026
Even I'm angry and feel it's unfair.

1162
01:04:02,656 --> 01:04:04,466
I'm regretting it.

1163
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:07,976
But...

1164
01:04:08,696 --> 01:04:11,986
do you really want to quit? 
It was tough to get in.

1165
01:04:12,806 --> 01:04:14,226
It was.

1166
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:17,246
I wanted to get in so badly.

1167
01:04:18,816 --> 01:04:21,506
If you leave the company,

1168
01:04:21,506 --> 01:04:23,366
what will you do then?

1169
01:04:24,846 --> 01:04:27,876
I'll work on construction
 sites temporarily

1170
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:30,526
and look into other design companies.

1171
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:32,386
Geez...

1172
01:04:32,386 --> 01:04:33,976
Well?

1173
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:39,276
I don't think you really want
 to leave the company.

1174
01:04:40,406 --> 01:04:43,806
Leaving like that is like running away.

1175
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:47,476
It's unfair to be mistreated because
 you're the CEO's daughter.

1176
01:04:47,476 --> 01:04:49,586
But how about you 
endure a little longer?

1177
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:51,776
"Let's see how far you go."

1178
01:04:51,776 --> 01:04:53,136
With that kind of mindset.

1179
01:04:53,886 --> 01:04:55,056
Endure?

1180
01:04:55,056 --> 01:04:56,546
Yeah.

1181
01:04:56,546 --> 01:04:58,996
If you're really talented,

1182
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:01,326
your talent will be 
acknowledged at some point.

1183
01:05:01,326 --> 01:05:03,386
No matter how others 
try to interfere.

1184
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:08,856
In my opinion, 
you're like that, Moong-i.

1185
01:05:08,856 --> 01:05:12,566
And all the work you put
 into it becomes a waste.

1186
01:05:15,826 --> 01:05:17,346
Endure.

1187
01:05:18,156 --> 01:05:19,656
You face it.

1188
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,546
I won't lose.

1189
01:05:21,546 --> 01:05:22,936
That's right.

1190
01:05:27,946 --> 01:05:31,106
So my Seo Yeon is getting married?

1191
01:05:31,106 --> 01:05:35,026
I'll show up at your 
wedding proudly, Seo Yeon.

1192
01:05:39,886 --> 01:05:41,266
 

1193
01:05:41,266 --> 01:05:43,746
 

1194
01:05:43,746 --> 01:05:45,936
Hwang Na Ro?

1195
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,636
 

1196
01:05:51,016 --> 01:05:52,406
Yes, Chairwoman.

1197
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,396
 The retainer has been deposited. 

1198
01:05:54,396 --> 01:05:58,076
 As for small things, 
deal with Mr. Hwang. 

1199
01:05:58,076 --> 01:05:59,646
Thank you, Chairwoman.

1200
01:05:59,646 --> 01:06:01,506
I'll do my best.

1201
01:06:05,146 --> 01:06:07,736
Granny, you'll stay out of it

1202
01:06:07,736 --> 01:06:10,156
and let Hwang Na Ro deal with me?

1203
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:12,756
Geez.

1204
01:06:12,826 --> 01:06:15,436
Hwang Na Ro, what a nuisance.

1205
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:18,116
Geez.

1206
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,756
Lee Soon Jung.

1207
01:06:35,456 --> 01:06:37,756
I'm sure you were stunned, but

1208
01:06:37,816 --> 01:06:40,536
I'm sure you'll understand 
where I'm coming from.

1209
01:06:46,676 --> 01:06:51,036
Jung Min Jae, who's going all out 
for her ex-husband's happiness.

1210
01:06:51,036 --> 01:06:52,566
You're so cool.

1211
01:06:56,996 --> 01:07:00,086
But why do I feel so empty?

1212
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:03,188
A cold wind from Siberia is blowing.

1213
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,110
Is it because I returned
 the red dictionary?

1214
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:20,000
Noonim, hello.

1215
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,530
Oh, dumplings?

1216
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:23,730
Ba Wi and I made some dumplings.

1217
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:25,010
I thought of you.

1218
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,580
Do you like dumplings?

1219
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,460
Yes, I love it.

1220
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,600
Gosh, you made them so nicely.

1221
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,810
You can do stuff like this?

1222
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,910
Yes, I enjoy cooking.

1223
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:36,200
Gosh, I see.

1224
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,600
 Oh, my. So sweet. 

1225
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,680
Why don't you come inside?

1226
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,430
Oh, it's okay.

1227
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,720
You should eat this while it's hot.

1228
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,280
Try one.

1229
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,970
Should I?

1230
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,360
It's so good.

1231
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,390
How could dumplings taste so savory?

1232
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,940
I'm happy to see you enjoy it.

1233
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,410
Oh, yeah. Are you craving
 anything particular?

1234
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,700
I'll make it for you.

1235
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,200
Well?

1236
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,060
Just tell me. I can make anything.

1237
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,540
Well...

1238
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,390
Ttekboki.

1239
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,080
Ttekboki.

1240
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,450
I'm the master at it.

1241
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,870
Another one.

1242
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:28,180
Well? Oyster salad.

1243
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,500
Oyster salad. That's my specialty.

1244
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,370
With water parsley.

1245
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,830
That's right.

1246
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,050
That sounds good.

1247
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,670
Noonim. Noonim!

1248

1249
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:49,930
Are you okay? Noonim.

1250
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,890

 Bring your real daughter
