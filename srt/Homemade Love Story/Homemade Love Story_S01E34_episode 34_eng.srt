1
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,400
  Are you here to see Mr. Lee?  

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
  Because you had been looking at him.  

3
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,500
  Why don't you think more about that guy?  

4
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,100
  Na Ro, you know something about Park Pil Hong, right?  

5
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,700
  Well.  

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,800
  I'm not going to comment on that.  

7
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,900
Yes, Jung Won.

8
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,250
Sure.

9
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,440
     

10
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,480
Seo Yeon's mom asked me to see her for a second.

11
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,300
Did Seo Yeon leave?

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,800
Yes.

13
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,610
Then, I'll be back soon.

14
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,100
After seeing the CEO, you'll be back here, right?

15
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,670
I don't know. I think Seo Yeon's mom wouldn't want me to come back here.

16
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,340
But please come back. We need to talk.

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,740
By the way, Mr. Woo.

18
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,550
After you figured who I am, don't you think you had been treating me a bit roughly, do you?

19
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,400
When you knew me as Lee Dong Chool, you had been very nice to me.

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,600
I want to be nice to you as well.

21
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,020
But if I think about Chae Woon, it's not easy.

22
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,200
Mr. Lee, no, Mr. Park...

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,800
Anyway, don't you think you would've done the same if you were me?

24
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,300
Well, that makes sense.

25
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,370
By the way, you are also,

26
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,620
after you got revealed that you're Park Pil Hong, you have an arrogant attitude to me. Did you know that?

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,360
What is it?

28
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,600
I think I can be like that since I'm Seo Yeon's father.

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry?

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,090
Then, I'll be back, Mr. Woo.

31
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,190
Wow. I guess the CEO had a lot of trouble back in the days.

32
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,540
Park Pil Hong.

33
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,790
This was what you meant as you're staying near Seo Yeon?

34
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,950
How dare you stay around Jae Hee as well?

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Did your son tell you about me? That tall and handsome dude.

36
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,650
I didn't know your son would be Jae Hee's friend.

37
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,470
- This is why I wanted to leave Woo Jae Hee's site. 
 - You should leave now.

38
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,970
Don't hang around my Seo Yeon and leave now!

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,300
Jung Won. Don't get upset. Your beautiful face might get wrinkled.

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,900
I didn't even pretend to know Seo Yeon!

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But somehow, Woo Jae Hee figured it out. That guy is smart.

42
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,100
So I wanted to quit that workplace, but he was like, I shouldn't leave the work.

43
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,400
He said I should be around where he can watch me. He's pretty cute.

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Park Pil Hong..!

45
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,630
I get it. I'll go somewhere else.

46
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,400
But the chairwoman said she's going to invest in my business. I'll just work on that as it is.

47
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

48
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,800
My mom is going to invest in you?

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,040
I showed her a good item.

50
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,140
She has a great intuition for business.

51
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,500
I'll make a great success with this project, and come to you and Seo Yeon!

52
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,680
Do you think I'll let you get that investment? I'm not going to let that happen.

53
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,560
Please! Get away from my Seo Yeon and Jae Hee!

54
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,020
That makes me sad.

55
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,200
Can't you think of me in a better way?

56
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,070
Please...

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,470
Ms. Lee, you came back. Mr. Woo went out right now.

58
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,600
I heard about it.

59
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,950
Do you want some coffee?

60
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,300
Why?

61
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,320
Right?

62
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes?

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,100
You are Park Pil Hong.

64
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

65
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,380
You're Park Pil Hong, right?

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,470
When my mom came here,

67
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,080
she wasn't here to see Jae Hee, was she?

68
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,830
I don't know what you're saying.

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,410
Does Jae Hee know about this?

70
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,730
- Ms. Lee. 
 - Does he know about this!

71
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,840
I was just...

73
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,500
Don't come closer to me!

74
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,350
Seo Yeon.

75
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,040
Moong-i.

76
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Moong-i! Chae Woon!

77
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,480
Why didn't you tell me?

78
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Why didn't you tell me about this?

79
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,000
Why didn't you tell me! Why!

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,100
Why didn't you tell me about this? Why!

81
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm sorry.

82
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,800
I wanted to tell you, but I just couldn't.

83
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,320
I also just figured this out.

84
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,460
I talked with him, but he didn't have any other intentions.

85
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,000
He just missed you and wanted to be near you.

86
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,670
Then what about this photo?

87
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:18,050
He switched the photo as well.

88
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,520
I didn't expect to meet him like this.

89
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,360
Both of my moms and chairwoman,

90
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,470
all of them, talked badly about Park Pil Hong.

91
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,430
But I thought he would have his reasons, so there must be a misunderstanding.

92
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,700
I wanted to believe like that.

93
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,330
I think he's not that terrible person.

94
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,200
I guess he had to live not a good life somehow because of some misfortunes.

95
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,060
You saw that earlier as well.

96
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,530
In front of my mom and me,

97
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,160
he was faking it without any shame.

98
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,520
My mom was frozen as if she lost her soul.

99
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,730
How can he be so shameless...

100
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,200
I can totally understand your feeling.

101
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,660
But I think he had no option at that moment.

102
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,030
- Because you and the CEO came in together-- 
 - Don't try to take his side for me.

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,300
If you do it more, it makes me more ashamed.

104
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Hwang Na Ro.

105
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,280
I think he knows Park Pil Hong.

106
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,190
When I asked him about it, he didn't agree nor disagree.

107
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,940
Those two, they were in the same prison together.

108
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,560
How was it, chairwoman?

109
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
- Hwang Na Ro is pretty good, right? 
 - Yes!

110
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,400
He's brilliant.

111
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,580
Sorry, we called you when you are busy.

112
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,780
No, it's okay.

113
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,400
I'll just say it simply.

114
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,850
You would've known Park Pil Hong from the prison,

115
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,250
and you would've heard about Bit Chae Woon from him,

116
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,600
so you came into Samgwang villa with intention. Am I right?

117
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,480
So you were trying to get involved with Bit Chae Woon, but that didn't work out,

118
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,950
and you got caught by Mr. Woo and Bit Chae Woon. Is that correct?

119
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,600
If that's the case,

120
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,230
are you looking for a different target because Chae Woon didn't work out?

121
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,650
I heard you start working as a chairwoman's secretary. Is that also part of the scheme..?

122
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,810
That's not true, right? We're assuming too much, right?

123
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,970
No, that's all correct.

124
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,050
Everything that aunt said is right.

125
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,280
That's why Woo Jae Hee and Bit Chae Woon

126
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,550
keep pressuring me to leave the Samgwang villa,

127
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,100
but I'm holding on to it.

128
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,310
Why?

129
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,770
Why?

130
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,100
It's because I like the Samgwang villa a lot.

131
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,760
Sure.

132
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,830
That sounds like real.

133
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,940
The tears that you shed when it was just two of us were fake, right?

134
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,690
You hold it on to it pretty well.

135
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,180
I admire your sincerity. But...

136
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,330
you should leave, Na Ro.

137
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,520
When we figured who you are, we can't live together anymore.

138
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,790
Jjung-a...

139
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,200
It's really cold these days.

140
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,040
- So why don't we talk about him leaving the Samgwang villa when the weather gets warmer? 
 - No.

141
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,000
Bit Chae and Mr. Woo might have thought of Soon Jung and didn't say anything about you.

142
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,510
But I'm different from them.

143
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,740
I can't treat you like before.

144
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,800
Also, I can't lie to my sister.

145
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
So you should leave today.

146
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,000
If you don't, I'm going to tell everything to everybody in Samgwang villa.

147
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,220
Are you going to tell everything to Soon Jung?

148
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,370
Yes. I don't have a choice.

149
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,800
Our kindest Soon Jung might get shocked and sick for a couple of days, but what can I do?

150
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,320
Why don't we do it like that? Hwang Na Ro.

151
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,010
I'm busy with work right now, so I'll get going first.

152
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,920
You're not answering my question.

153
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,260
Until where is your honest feeling?

154
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,970
The part when I said I like Samgwang villa.

155
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,850
To such trash like me,

156
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,590
I think it's going to be the first and the last place

157
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,700
that feels like my real home.

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,200
Have a safe trip back home.

159
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,260
I feel sorry for Na Ro.

160
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,800
Why do I feel bad for him?

161
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
  I know.  

162
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,260
Yes, mother!

163
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,820
Oh, Na Ro! Sorry, I called you when you're busy.

164
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,460
No, it's okay. Why did you call me?

165
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,130
Let's have dinner together tonight.

166
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,660
James will come by tonight,

167
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,860
  and everybody in Samgwang villa will get together.  

168
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,380
Ah...

169
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,900
If you say you can't have dinner together again, I'll be really angry!

170
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,280
But what should I do? I have an office get-together.

171
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,800
Is that so? Chae Woon said she's going to get off early today.

172
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,710
Now we're in different departments.

173
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,600
It's really sad. I thought we'd all get together for today.

174
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,750
I'm sorry, mother.

175
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,890
Yes, I'll talk to you later.

176
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,900
Did you figure out everything now?

177
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,040
Why didn't you tell me?

178
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,780
Was it fun until now?

179
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,200
You should've just told me.

180
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,870
Hey, Mr. Woo!

181
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,640
Was there something going on with Mr. Lee Dong Chool?

182
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,050
- Why? 
 - He suddenly said he's quitting and left.

183
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,740
What? When?

184
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,560
Right after you left.

185
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,840
Seo Yeon.

186
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,090
I'm sorry.

187
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,730
I'm going to make it and come back to you!

188
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,400
Wait for me until then, my daughter!

189
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,780
I'm asking you, why are you dealing with Park Pil Hong!

190
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,550
Why do you meeting up with him?

191
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,840
What do you think is the reason I saw him?

192
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,760
It's all because I don't want to put any dirt on your hand!

193
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,420
I heard you decided to invest in his business.

194
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,630
I just said that for the pretext.

195
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,950
I have to make him come close to me if I want to do anything with him!

196
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:18,240
Mom, did you give any weakness to Park Pil Hong?

197
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,100
- What? 
   - You have something.  

198
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:27,060
Park Pil Hong, he knew everything even to the fact that Soon Jung raised Seo Yeon!

199
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,570
There's something related to you, right?

200
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:35,180
- Isn't that the reason why he's going around like that right now? 
 - There's nothing!

201
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,540
You shouldn't meet up with him!

202
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,760
There are tons of people watching you.

203
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,510
I barely managed to postpone the vote of renewing the confidence of the CEO.

204
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,020
But you can't get yourself together still.

205
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,750
Be careful of your behavior!

206
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,280
  Lee Ra Hoon! Lee Ra Hoon! Let's go!  

207
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,940
What are you doing!

208
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,300
You have to knock before opening the door! I was in the middle of changing my clothes, Ba Reun.

209
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,750
What are you doing? Close the door.

210
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,120
I said close the door.

211
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,960
Ba Reun, close the door. I have to change my clothes. Close it now!

212
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,800
Seriously!

213
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,090
  I think, for a while,  

214
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,650
  I don't think I can make Chae Woon as my legal daughter.  

215
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,910
The CEO has to make Chae Woon into her legal daughter before Chae Woon gets married.

216
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,520
  Ba Reun, please. Knock before opening any door.  

217
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,680
- I feel so embarrassed! 
 - Are you going out for work?

218
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,620
- Food truck? 
 - Yes.

219
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,000
It's so cute to see the two of you together! Is it good to go to work together?

220
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,300
Yes! It's amazing.

221
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,000
Hey, don't be like that in front of mom.

222
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,220
Ra Hoon. Be nice to Ba Reun!

223
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,280
If he's not nice to you, just tell me, I'll take care of it. Okay?

224
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,610
Yes, Ms. Lee!

225
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,600
- Oh, no. Yes, mother. 
 - Mother? Why is she your mother?

226
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,700
'Mother' sounds great! Na Ro also calls me a mother.

227
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
You know that we are going to have a get-together tonight, right?

228
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,810
- Of course. 
 - Yes, we know about that!

229
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,380
- You should go to work now. 
 - We'll be home early!

230
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
- Okay! 
 - We'll be back soon!

231
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,500
Have a nice day!

232
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,700
- Let's hold hands! 
 - Wait, wait! Let me go for a second.

233
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,980
- Wait, wait. 
 - What is it?

234
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,700
- Alright. 
 - What about it?

235
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,050
- Now we got out of the Samgwang villa zone. 
 - What?

236
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,940
I allow physical contact.

237
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,300
Do you allow kisses, too?

238
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
What if somebody sees us? Let's go.

239
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,980
     

240
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,410
I was walking around the company this morning,

241
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,200
and I thought the cleaning department employees' rest area was too small.

242
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,870
Did you even go around that area?

243
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,400
You never went around there before!

244
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,200
Move their rest area next to the employees' rest area on the third floor,

245
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,800
and provide complete convenience facilities for them.

246
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,560
Oh! President, you said,

247
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,200
"How much is all that money! One convenience facility per floor is enough. Tell them to share it!" before!

248
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,630
Then are you saying we can spend a lot of money on this now?

249
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,810
Yes, sure. Spend a lot of money!

250
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,040
Yes, president! Then, I'll be back from franchise stores' inspection.

251
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,300
- Oh, wait. Franchise stores? 
 - Yes.

252
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll do that work.

253
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,700
Brother-in-law! I mean, president. You have a directors' meeting this afternoon.

254
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,370
We have too many meetings! It's inefficient.

255
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,800
From now on, let's have only one meeting per week, and let's keep them shorter than 30 minutes!

256
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,200
- Really? 
 - Do you like it?

257
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,600
Yes, brother-in-law! I love you! Love you!

258
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
Be careful!

259
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,800
- Are you okay? 
   - Yes, I'm fine!  

260
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,600
Welcome!

261
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,550
My mother's back is not good, and I heard the bed here is good for it.

262
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,030
You came all the way here!

263
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,470
Why don't you lie down here and try the bed?

264
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,160
It feels nice!

265
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,620
She likes it!

266
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,100
- I'll take this one. 
 - Yes.

267
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,970
  Doesn't it feel good?  

268
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,000
Noonim!

269
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,080
- Hello! 
 - Oh, professor!

270
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,910
What brings you here?

271
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,150
I'm sorry to bother you when you're busy.

272
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,700
I came here because of my mother in America. Her birthday is soon.

273
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,120
I wanted to get a good present recommendation from you.

274
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,410
We have a good present option for you.

275
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,270
What product should I recommend for you?

276
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:15,130
I like anything that you recommend to me.

277
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,000
  He has such a sweet smile!  

278
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,500
What's that? I'm sorry, but one second.

279
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,590
  President! You're here.  

280
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,190
Yes. Thank you for your hard work.

281
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,000
Min Jae, your dad is here.

282
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,640
I told him that you're my ex-husband.

283
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,400
Ex?

284
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Why did you have to say "ex-husband?"

285
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,040
Hello, president. It's good to see you again.

286
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,460
Ah, yes. Well...

287
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm so sorry for what I said last time.

288
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,870
The light was dark, so I couldn't see you well. I'm sorry.

289
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,240
Well, that can happen.

290
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,550
By the way, I think it's a good idea for you and your son to get some glasses.

291
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,390
I'm sorry?

292
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,010
Ah, yes! We will.

293
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,500
We'll get a thorough eye test.

294
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,620
  Why is this dude keep laughing like that?  

295
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
By the way, why are you here?

296
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,370
What do you mean? I'm here to inspect you, manager Jung Min Jae.

297
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,600
Oh, is that so, dad?

298
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,720
This is the product I was talking about it.

299
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,700
- Ah, yes. 
 - Why don't you take a look?

300
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,180
I think this is good for her to use it by herself.

301
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,690
  I think I heard his wife passed away.  

302
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,170
  They look nice together.  

303
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,900
That's a nice one, too. It's warm and nice.

304
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:18,260
  Right. Jae Hee's mom should start a new life.  

305
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,050
Really? Wow! Yes!

306
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,490
Then, I'll talk about it with my CEO, and I'll talk to you later.

307
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,300
As soon as possible? I get it. Thank you so much!

308
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,000
- What do you have to talk about it with the CEO? 
 - We are successful now!

309
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,890
What is it?

310
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,800
I just got a call from a big clothing company's shooting crew, and I guess they saw our website.

311
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,280
They loved our styling because it's unique, and they asked us if we can work together!

312
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,350
Did they say that to the executive member?

313
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,340
- That means they want to scout you! 
 - No, it was something like, what did they say?

314
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,200
- Subcontracting! They want to make a contract with us. 
 - Do you mean outsourcing?

315
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,760
Isn't this amazing? They loved my styling and called us!

316
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,910
But we have our workplace. Is it okay to take that job?

317
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,190
Honestly, we don't have much work in this company right now.

318
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,700
Why are you bringing that up again?

319
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,290
I mean, we are in the situation where we have to go out and work for second or third jobs,

320
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,180
but getting a call from a huge company is a very fortunate thing!

321
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Why don't we work hard together? How does that sound?

322
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,000
- Work hard together? 
 - Yes! We are comrades in the same boat.

323
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,210
- Comrades? 
 - Yes!

324
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,100
Comrades sound good.

325
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:40,890
You're pretty loyal than I thought. You could've just gone when you got a scout suggestion like that.

326
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,050
- Wait a minute. Why didn't I think of that? 
 - What?

327
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,590
I'm kidding! I shouldn't forget that you trusted me and hired me.

328
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,960
I'm a pretty loyal person!

329
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,480
  You're in such a complicated relationship with me, but why are you so pretty?  

330
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,830
  So she's my mom's biological daughter's younger sister.  

331
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,800
You don't like to do that work?

332
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,360
- No, no. 
 - Sure, then I'll just call them that we won't do it.

333
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,530
Wait, wait. Don't call them yet.

334
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:20,120
Yes, let's do that work. We should take it if there are any chances these days.

335
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,390
You said it! Nice!

336
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,560
- Oh, they called me again! 
 - Take it, take it!

337
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,000
Yes, hello?

338
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,630
Are you in such a hurry? Wait a moment, please.

339
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,250
They are in such a hurry. If we don't take it now, they're going to contact a different team.

340
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,610
- Turn off our voice. Did you turn it off? 
 - Yes.

341
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,320
They're saying they'll contact different teams or what is that they're trying to make a deal with us.

342
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,600
- So play hard to get! 
 - It's not the time to do that!

343
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,300
That's right. Tell them we'll take the job.

344
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,250
Yes! We'll take the job.

345
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,910
Thank you so much!

346
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,260
What is the company's name? I forgot to ask the most important thing.

347
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,060
- Yes. If you get the meeting schedule, let me know. Yes! 
 - What is the name of the company?

348
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,700
- Ask the name of the company! 
 - What?

349
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,580
- What about it? 
 - What?

350
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,070
This is ridiculous. What is the company's name?

351
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,120
- Ah, it's LX fashoin. 
 - What?!

352
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,430
It's such a coincidence. My sister works in the design team of this company.

353
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,960
  She's still an intern.  

354
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,500
Somebody might think I got this job because of my sister! But it was totally my own ability.

355
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,480
I'm going to brag this to my sister!

356
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,690
- I'm not going to do this job. 
 - What?

357
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,770
- I'm not doing it. 
 - You're not doing what?

358
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,990
- I'm not doing it. 
 - This work?

359
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,090
- I'm not doing that work. 
 - Why?

360
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,400
- I can't do it. 
 - What?

361
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,780
I can't do this, and I'm not doing this job!

362
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,340
I don't like this job 100 percent as well. I don't like CEO Kim Jung Won that well.

363
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,240
But we wouldn't have a chance to meet the CEO anyway. That's why I said we could do the job.

364
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,000
That's not the problem. I can't do this! I'm not doing this!

365
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,100
What? How can you switch your mind that easily!

366
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,400
Why are you keep... I feel like you're doing this on purpose!

367
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,300
- Why are you keep touching me in a public situation? 
 - Seriously! Don't have physical contact with me in public.

368
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,380
You're just going there because you're embarrassed, aren't you? There's nothing to do over there.

369
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,260
What's written over there? What is it?

370
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
There was a lot of work today.

371
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,920
But I'm glad we made a good design!

372
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,040
  Seo Yeon.  

373
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,550
Bit Chae Woon, are you not getting off from work?

374
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,250
Oh, yes. I'm leaving, too.

375
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,340
- You've all done a good job. I'll see you tomorrow! 
 - Yes, see you tomorrow!

376
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,790
  It's really sad.  

377
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:53,290
  I thought we'd all get together for today.  

378
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,690
- Hwang Na Ro! 
 - Yes.

379
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,900
- Are you busy today? 
 - No.

380
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,800
We should celebrate you getting the permanent position.

381
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,520
That sounds great.

382
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,790
Director Jang.

383
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,650
- Are you done with your work? 
 - Yes.

384
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,690
Let's have dinner together.

385
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,620
Ah, I was going to talk with Hwang Na Ro.

386
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,490
Is it an urgent case?

387
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,260
- It's not like that. 
 - If it's not, then why don't you talk with him in the office tomorrow?

388
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,040
Today, let's have dinner with me.

389
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,140
I'm going to work a little longer.

390
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,420
Then, why don't the three of us eat together?

391
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,900
Seo Ah.

392
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,710
Why are you acting like this?

393
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,850
Ba Reun!

394
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,600
- Can you peel the onions? 
 - Yes, mother.

395
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,200
- Be careful! 
 - Cha Ba Reun! You should do it right!

396
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,120
Noona, you should do it right!

397
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,210
Are you taking her side because you guys are a couple?

398
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Lee Hae Deun! Stop that and make the food.

399
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,210
- Hey! Get away from each other. 
 - Stop that!

400
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,020
Let's lower the heat.

401
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,700
- We're home! 
 - I'm home!

402
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,310
  Welcome home!  

403
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,770
- What are you making? 
 - It smells nice, right?

404
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,360
Oh! What is it?

405
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,170
Wow! What is this? It looks amazing!

406
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,900
- Do you need some help? 
 - No, it's okay.

407
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:33,430
It's so nice to have dinner with my daughter, just two of us, in a while.

408
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,920
You feel empty without Bit Chae Woon, don't you?

409
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,560
No!

410
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,740
I have you!

411
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,800
Mom.

412
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,600
Let's have some fruit!

413
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,020
What do you want to say to me?

414
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,450
What?

415
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,950
I figured it out already.

416
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,870
I knew you're trying to find the right timing to say something to me since we got out of the office.

417
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,220
Just tell me.

418
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,690
It's about...

419
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,720
Is it about Bit Chae Woon again?

420
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,330
Are you going to send her study abroad?

421
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,460
Or is it something else?

422
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,350
Chae Woon and Jae Hee

423
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,700
are thinking about

424
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,100
getting married.

425
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:44,189
When did you hear about this?

426
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:48,299
This afternoon.

427
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:53,439
  Two of them haven't made any concrete decisions yet.  

428
00:34:56,509 --> 00:34:58,189
They finally...

429
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:07,499
I thought I had to tell you about this.

430
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,479
Seo Ah.

431
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:22,599
Is there anything I can do for you?

432
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:32,199
You can't help me with anything about this, mom.

433
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,499
Even if you spend all of the money, it's the thing you can't get.

434
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,399
The Jae Hee's heart.

435
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,399
  - Jae Hee! 
 - Hello.  

436
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,599
  You should look at the front.  

437
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,169
  You're not going to take responsibility for me! You only come to me when something is going on like this!  

438
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:52,309
  How can you be like this to me!  

439
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:37,189
Were you waiting for me?

440
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:38,599
Yes.

441
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,499
You've been feeling bad all day, haven't you?

442
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:49,699
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell you about that earlier.

443
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:52,249
I thought about it,

444
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:55,679
and I can understand where you were coming from.

445
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:04,239
Did you talk with Park Pil Hong after that?

446
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:10,659
When I got to the site after I saw you, he was gone.

447
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:15,399
He doesn't pick up his phone as well? You know Lee Dong Chool's phone number.

448
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:17,859
He also erased the phone number.

449
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:23,539
He's totally self-centered.

450
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,599
For me, it was basically meeting my biological father for the first time in my life.

451
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,699
Moong-i.

452
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:47,339
I hope you can calm down a bit. Today is a get-together dinner for the Samgwang people.

453
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,509
Big daughter!

454
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,409
- Father, are you coming now? 
 - Yes.

455
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:04,939
Hello, father.

456
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:08,599
- Hello, big daughter. I haven't seen you in a while. 
 - Right.

457
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,599
By the way, you don't look okay.

458
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,469
Is the work hard these days?

459
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:15,909
No, it's okay.

460
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:19,109
- I missed you a lot. 
 - Me, too.

461
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:25,399
But don't you guys have good news to share with me?

462
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:30,169
Something like, maybe you guys decided to get married.

463
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:33,239
Oh? How did you know about that?

464
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:36,659
We just talked about it yesterday.

465
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:39,219
Is it real?

466
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,099
Yes.

467
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:45,869
Congratulations, big daughter!

468
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,099
Thank you.

469
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,399
Thank you for liking our Jae Hee.

470
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:55,849
Now I feel glad about you.

471
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:59,969
- You felt glad of me already. 
 - What?

472
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,999
Then are you allowing our marriage..?

473
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,779
Of course! Of course!

474
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:09,799
Congratulations. Also, thank you.

475
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:13,699
Ah! Then, you're going to be my big daughter as well.

476
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:17,129
Aigo, I'm so happy!

477
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,649
Thank you so much.

478
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:23,729
You should tell your mother about this soon as well. So she doesn't feel left out.

479
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:25,229
Yes, I should.

480
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:29,729
By the way, how did you know that we decided to get married just by seeing us?

481
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:31,459
Do you want to know?

482
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:32,969
Yes.

483
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,079
I just assumed.

484
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:47,039
Thank you, thank you so much!

485
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:55,219
- We're home. 
 - My father is here, too!

486
00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:00,499
- Hello! 
 - James!

487
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:02,249
President, thank you for coming.

488
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:03,949
Yes, how have you been?

489
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:05,899
  It looks great!  

490
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:08,899
It's done!

491
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:12,199
Thank you for your hard work, everybody!

492
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:13,779
You worked hard, unni.

493
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:16,669
- Let's have a seat! 
   - Shall we?  

494
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:18,929
Wait, wait.

495
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:21,699
Where's Eems hyung?

496
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:23,499
Where did he go?

497
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,529
Did he go upstairs?

498
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:35,399
Every Samgwang people are gathering tonight, so I thought I should wear it like this.

499
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,489
- Those clothes were what you had in the bag? 
 - Yes.

500
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:44,289
Eems hyung! Your dress code is perfect tonight!

501
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:46,199
I think you look better in what you're wearing right now.

502
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:47,739
Is that so?

503
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:51,019
Everybody, thank you for waiting.

504
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,489
Let's celebrate our Samgwang people's gathering,

505
00:41:55,509 --> 00:42:00,149
- celebrate that all of us could gather all of a sudden-- 
 - It's not all of us.

506
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:01,809
Oh, that's right. Na Ro's not here.

507
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,129
I called him earlier today, and he said he's busy with work today.

508
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:10,219
I guess Na Ro oppa got promoted, so he got busier.

509
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:11,999
Did CP get promoted?

510
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:14,529
Yes! He got officially appointed.

511
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:17,359
To what department?

512
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:19,819
Is he in the same department as Chae Woon?

513
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,189
Ah, he got into the chairwoman's secretary department.

514
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:27,199
- Do you mean Lee Choon Seok chairwoman? 
 - Yes.

515
00:42:27,889 --> 00:42:31,479
Wow, isn't the chairwoman's secretary is the best position?

516
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:33,649
Na Ro hyung got a really good position!

517
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:36,069
Yes! It's amazing!

518
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:40,619
Anyway, that's good news.

519
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:45,199
Yes! That's what happened. Unfortunately, member Hwang Na Ro couldn't join tonight,

520
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,099
but our Eems hyungnim could fill in that space tonight, so I'm grateful for that as well.

521
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:52,599
Then let's have a toast, everybody!

522
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,139
- Every Samgwang people--! 
   - Wait, wait!  

523
00:42:56,749 --> 00:42:58,899
- Oh! 
 - Na Ro!

524
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:00,849
Sorry, I'm late.

525
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,739
Na Ro! I'm glad you could make it.

526
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:09,279
I thought you couldn't make it tonight as well, so I was sad.

527
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,089
  I'm glad you could make it.  

528
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:12,589
CP, it's been a while.

529
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:14,719
You're here. How have you been?

530
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:22,239
Since he's here, we should bring a chair!

531
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:27,039
  Have a seat!  

532
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:30,479
Since he's here!

533
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,899
Na Ro!

534
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:42,979
I thought you couldn't make it tonight, so I was going to do this tomorrow morning. Here!

535
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:46,569
Na Ro, congratulations on your promotion!

536
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:50,799
- Thank you so much... 
 - Ta-da! I have a hat as well!

537
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,669
  It looks good on you!  

538
00:43:54,899 --> 00:44:02,299
Na Ro, congratulations on your promotion. You'll get better and better from now on!

539
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:03,749
Thank you, mother.

540
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:09,159
  Everybody!   ♫   Congratulations on your promotion!   ♫

541
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:12,189
♫   Congratulations on your promotion!    ♫

542
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:16,849
♫   - Dear Na Ro!   ♫ 
 - One more time!

543
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:20,349
♫   Dear Na Ro!   ♫

544
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:26,499
♫   Congratulations on your promotion!   ♫  Round of applaud!  

545
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:33,899
Wait! Before blowing off the candle, please give us a word, Na Ro!

546
00:44:38,669 --> 00:44:40,819
Thank you so much!

547
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:43,399
In my life,

548
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:49,259
this is the first time getting a celebration.

549
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,359
Thank you.

550
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,609
Is that so?

551
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:01,549
Then I should do this more often for you!

552
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:04,899
Now, let's blow off the candles.

553
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:06,679
Yes.

554
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,639
- Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations, CP!

555
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:16,399
- Congratulations! 
 - Hyung, congratulations!

556
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:26,239
  - Na Ro, you should do the cutting for the cake, right? 
 - Ah, yes.  

557
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:30,759
  Here. Take this off as well.  

558
00:45:47,419 --> 00:45:51,919
Why is Woo Jung Hoo bothers my meditation?

559
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:56,399
Why did he look so lonely?

560
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:03,759
  Thank you.  

561
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:06,319
  Excuse me!  

562
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:12,729
  Jae Hee's mom...  

563
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,879
Yes, a new start.

564
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:18,309
I should make Woo Jung Hoo have a new start in his life.

565
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,469
His first love, Soon Jung, is single as well, so it's perfect!

566
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:28,799
I'm going to start the 'Woo Jung Hoo's fresh start' project!

567
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:33,339
This soup is amazing!

568
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,339
Mr. Woo! I'll get you some more soup.

569
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:40,059
- No, no! I can do it for myself. 
 - It's okay.

570
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,399
No, I'll do it. Mother! Let me do it.

571
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,999
- Let me do it. 
 - No, it's okay.

572
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:55,299
By the way, did you tell the president about your marriage?

573
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:58,969
- Ah, yes. 
 - What did he say?

574
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,679
He said congratulations.

575
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:02,349
Did he?

576
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:08,199
We already told the CEO about it as well, and she congratulated us.

577
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,549
That's good.

578
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:17,269
Then, since everybody's gathered tonight, why don't we announce it to everybody?

579
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:18,799
Shall we?

580
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:20,949
Yes. Oh, wait!

581
00:47:20,979 --> 00:47:22,529
What about your mother?

582
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,229
We're going to tell her tomorrow.

583
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,329
Yes. Don't forget to tell her.

584
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:29,609
Then, let's go back.

585
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:40,599
We have great news.

586
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,069
  I knew it.  

587
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:47,169
I knew unni would have something. What is it?

588
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:51,949
- Mr. Woo, do you want to say it for yourself? 
 - Should I do that?

589
00:47:52,499 --> 00:47:54,299
Everybody!

590
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,319
Moong-i, no...

591
00:47:56,929 --> 00:47:59,449
Chae Woon and I...

592
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:02,749
are going to get married.

593
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,449
  - What? 
 - Really?  

594
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:06,999
- Unni, is this real? 
 - Oh, my goodness!

595
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:13,839
- Bit Chae! Hey! 
 - I already heard about this!

596
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:15,779
Congratulations to you again, Chae Woon.

597
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:17,939
Thank you so much.

598
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:19,329
Why are you crying?

599
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,169
  How can you already get married!  

600
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,009
  You have to make Chae Woon happy! Really happy!  

601
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:27,999
There are so many things to celebrate today!

602
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:32,299
Our Samgwang villa's first couple!

603
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:36,369
To our Koala and Moong-i's wedding!

604
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:40,559
- Let's have a toast! Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

605
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,399
Thank you so much!

606
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:51,899
   You have to be nice to her. You have to make Chae Woon happy!  

607
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:57,669
     

608
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,239
You have to be nice to her! Okay?

609
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:05,499
You have to make Chae Woon happy! You know what I'm saying, right?

610
00:49:28,249 --> 00:49:30,019
Do you want to come inside?

611
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:32,989
- We're eating dinner right now. 
 - I don't need to.

612
00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:35,599
I'll just talk to you here.

613
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,099
What is it?

614
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:41,849
I heard you're going to get married to Jae Hee?

615
00:49:43,029 --> 00:49:45,679
- Did you hear that from mom? 
 - Mom?

616
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:49,649
Are you talking about not your mom in there, but my mom?

617
00:49:56,919 --> 00:49:59,919
You already got a ring as well.

618
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:07,419
- If you're not going to come inside, then let's talk at the office tomorrow. 
 - How can you do this to me?

619
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,069
How can you get married to Jae Hee?

620
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:14,099
You left our house to do this. To hit me from my back!

621
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:16,219
Please stop this!

622
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:20,599
I moved back here. I did what you wanted!

623
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:22,769
But then...

624
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:28,639
I don't know how much I have to take care of you acting like a baby.

625
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:31,049
Acting like a baby?

626
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:37,499
- Hey. 
 - Your obsession with Jae Hee is not love.

627
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,009
If you really love him, I don't think you can act like that.

628
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:45,289
Who are you? Who the hell are you can say that?

629
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:47,949
How dare you try to teach me!

630
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:50,699
Director!

631
00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:53,289
- Let me go. 
 - Don't be like this.

632
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:55,349
I said, let me go!

633
00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:58,609
Let go of me, you bastard. Let me go!

634
00:50:58,879 --> 00:51:01,059
Jang Seo Ah, don't do this.

635
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,639
Seo Ah!

636
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,189
Are you okay?

637
00:51:13,399 --> 00:51:15,599
Let's go inside. Huh?

638
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:21,669
Why are you making me a crazy person? Why are you looking at me like I'm a mad person?

639
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,029
Jae Hee oppa...

640
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:29,499
How can you do this to me?

641
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:33,009
Seo Ah.

642
00:51:34,169 --> 00:51:36,059
  Seo Ah?  

643
00:51:39,759 --> 00:51:42,619
You should come in. Why are you standing here?

644
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:49,509
I just came here to talk with Bit Chae Woon.

645
00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:05,979
Shall we drink?

646
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:21,469
Seo Ah, you must be sad and upset.

647
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:26,029
Because Jae Hee doesn't know how you feel.

648
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,179
Seo Ah.

649
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:36,799
I know you had been relying on Jae Hee a lot since your father passed away early on.

650
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:50,639
After all this time, I realized the ardent love that I had

651
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:54,239
wasn't love, after all.

652
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:57,769
Also, at that time,

653
00:52:57,789 --> 00:53:01,259
something that I didn't think was a big deal

654
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:05,579
was love, after all.

655
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,899
Sometimes it can turn out to be like that.

656
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:18,999
I know that you had loved Jae Hee so prettily.

657
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,029
Back in the days.

658
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:29,599
But now, in my opinion,

659
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:38,329
I wonder if you're getting confused by your own feelings.

660
00:53:40,649 --> 00:53:42,629
It's only my opinion.

661
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:46,039
Father...

662
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:53,659
The person I love looking in a different direction

663
00:53:53,669 --> 00:54:00,279
can make you sad and sometimes makes you so upset that you want to pinch them really hard.

664
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:03,219
But if you really love them,

665
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:06,729
if you loved them,

666
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:10,899
understand that that person is looking in a different direction.

667
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:14,579
But I love them more,

668
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:18,069
so I should let them go gladly.

669
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:24,119
I wonder what if you can think it this way.

670
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:26,739
Father...

671
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:30,469
I can't do that.

672
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:34,229
It's not easy.

673
00:54:48,339 --> 00:54:50,129
You can do it.

674
00:54:50,149 --> 00:54:54,149
You can do it as well, Seo Ah.

675
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,159
When you can do that, you're becoming a real adult.

676
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:12,199
Seo Ah, you are a very lovely and bright person since you were young.

677
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:14,609
I know about that well.

678
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:26,829
I want you to laugh well and be bright like you used to be.

679
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:37,619
You and the uncle met up with Hwang Na Ro?

680
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:39,799
Yes.

681
00:55:40,419 --> 00:55:42,899
We heard about it from Mr. Woo.

682
00:55:43,249 --> 00:55:46,189
About what kind of person Hwang Na Ro is.

683
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:50,699
How much did he tell you about him?

684
00:55:51,299 --> 00:55:59,099
Well, he just... yes.

685
00:56:02,709 --> 00:56:07,709
I guess you heard all about that my biological father and Hwang Na Ro knows each other.

686
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:10,959
I know about it as well.

687
00:56:11,429 --> 00:56:13,989
My biological father,

688
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:18,499
I mean, Park Pil Hong, I know how he lives right now.

689
00:56:20,389 --> 00:56:22,759
Did you know about this?

690
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,099
He seems to still dream about hitting the jackpot!

691
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:36,399
What should we do?

692
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:40,719
He is a real problem.

693
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:47,739
I think the CEO is also having a hard time because of him.

694
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:51,699
Jung Won unni must be like that, too.

695
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,819
My Bit Chae doesn't have a peaceful time, do you?

696
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:09,919
Hey! But congratulations on your getting married.

697
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,299
You made a great decision! You made a great decision, Bit Chae!

698
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:18,279
I'm jealous.

699
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:22,359
You should get married, too!

700
00:57:22,749 --> 00:57:24,049
Me?

701
00:57:24,379 --> 00:57:26,249
With whom?

702
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:29,269
You have somebody.

703
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,029
What are you talking about it?

704
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:34,179
What are you talking about it? Who do I have?

705
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:36,079
- My goodness. 
 - You do have somebody! Where are you going?

706
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:38,149
- What do you mean? I should go. 
 - You have someone!

707
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,509
Don't kid with me! But why are you teared up?

708
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:47,439
  If you loved them,  

709
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:51,649
  understand that that person is looking in a different direction.  

710
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:55,319
  But I love them more,  

711
00:57:56,009 --> 00:57:58,699
  so I should let them go gladly.  

712
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:04,309
  I wonder what if you can think it this way.  

713
00:58:05,259 --> 00:58:07,579
No.

714
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:12,699
I can't do it like that.

715
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:18,099
I can't do it.

716
00:58:26,939 --> 00:58:30,929
     

717
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:40,629
  Jae Hee oppa.  

718
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:44,779
  How can you do this to me?  

719
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:49,499
It makes me feel worried.

720
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:08,839
I ended up leaving like this.

721
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:36,709
  - I'm sorry! 
 - It didn't hurt me!  

722
00:59:36,759 --> 00:59:38,779
  Ah, really!  

723
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:46,669
  - Wow, that's amazing! 
 - Na Ro oppa, you're very strong!  

724
00:59:46,689 --> 00:59:49,499
  You got this! You got this!  

725
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,019
  Congratulations!  

726
01:00:04,629 --> 01:00:06,559
Na Ro!

727
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,289
Mother..!

728
01:00:08,299 --> 01:00:11,019
Did you come out to get some water?

729
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:13,409
Ah, yes.

730
01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:16,399
It must be uncomfortable for you to come out to get water all the time.

731
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:20,999
I'll get a water dispenser in your room next month.

732
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:24,959
I'll get small installment savings coming out.

733
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:29,179
Thank you.

734
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,019
- Is your room not cold? 
 - It's warm.

735
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:35,499
That's good to hear. You should go to bed.

736
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,999
- Good night. 
 - Yes, sleep tight.

737
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,099
Mother!

738
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,299
Yes? What's wrong?

739
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:52,099
Can I hug you for once?

740
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:57,689
Of course! You can hug me!

741
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:09,069
You did great, Na Ro. You worked so well that you got promoted.

742
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:11,669
I'm proud of you.

743
01:01:13,749 --> 01:01:16,279
Thank you so much...

744
01:01:19,149 --> 01:01:22,149
Maybe it's because I'm so happy...

745
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:27,239
There wouldn't be anyone else in the world who is as nice as you.

746
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:29,979
Really?

747
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:34,399
I'm glad that you said that to me!

748
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:39,199
But that's not true.

749
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:43,799
If you look around more carefully,

750
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:46,909
there will be a lot of good people around you.

751
01:01:46,939 --> 01:01:51,779
So from tomorrow, you should look around more carefully. Okay?

752
01:01:52,299 --> 01:01:53,699
Yes, I will.

753
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:56,579
I don't know why I'm like this right now.

754
01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:00,689
Why are you crying? Don't cry, Na Ro.

755
01:02:00,709 --> 01:02:02,349
It's because I'm so happy.

756
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:04,879
Your hands are cold.

757
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:10,829
- You worked so hard. I'm really proud of you! 
 - Thank you.

758
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:33,069
♫   I'm in love,   ♫

759
01:02:33,099 --> 01:02:38,299
♫   I'm in love, I'm in love with you   ♫ 
      

760
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:45,379
♫   Stay with me forever   ♫

761
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:58,599
♫   You make me fill up my whole day with the thoughts of you   ♫

762
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:03,939
♫   With you   ♫

763
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:12,079
Ah! We really have to get this building project.

764
01:03:13,049 --> 01:03:15,649
We basically got this, right?

765
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,849
I set the contract terms to the best,

766
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:20,369
and the construction company says we have an advantage.

767
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:23,999
Okay. The materials company and the construction workers are all on ready as well.

768
01:03:24,029 --> 01:03:26,529
When we sign the contract, the construction has to start right away.

769
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:28,049
Okay!

770
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,229
We should do that.

771
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:36,859
All of you are working hard.

772
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:38,649
Ms. Lee, you are here!

773
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,339
Hello, Chief Yoo!

774
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,279
Moong-i, did you finish your work well?

775
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:45,169
Yes, I finished soon as possible and ran over here!

776
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:46,339
You did great!

777
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:48,739
Ms. Lee, congratulations on your getting married!

778
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:50,759
Thank you.

779
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:52,389
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

780
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:56,599
- I'll be back. 
 - Okay, I'll see you later! Fighting!

781
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,839
Oh!

782
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:10,099
Why?

783
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,909
I'm nervous.

784
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:18,339
- I guess you're most nervous about my mom among our parents. 
 - Yes.

785
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:23,919
When you're nervous, make your fingers like this, and just press it!

786
01:04:23,939 --> 01:04:26,289
Come this way.

787
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:33,969
Jae Hee! Bit Chae Woon! Welcome.

788
01:04:34,699 --> 01:04:37,299
Wow! These flowers are gorgeous!

789
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:41,389
- Did you pick this, Bit Chae Woon? 
 - Yes.

790
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:45,299
It has all of my favorite flowers! It's great!

791
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:52,129
By the way, why did you guys come here today?

792
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:56,389
  Ah, it's about...  

793
01:04:56,399 --> 01:04:58,499
What is it?

794
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:01,729
Did something get revealed again?

795
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:06,609
Something big enough as the fact that Bit Chae Woon is Jung Won's daughter!

796
01:05:06,629 --> 01:05:09,029
No, it's nothing like that.

797
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:11,299
Then, it's okay.

798
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:13,549
Mom.

799
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:15,439
Yes?

800
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:21,049
We're going to get married.

801
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:23,249
What?

802
01:05:24,609 --> 01:05:26,589
Marriage?

803
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:38,039
- Ah, you guys came here to talk about getting married. 
 - Yes.

804
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:42,599
Oh, you already have rings on your fingers.

805
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,499
You'll allow our marriage, right?

806
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:48,459
You liked Bit Chae Woon from the beginning.

807
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:53,929
Yes, I liked her from the beginning. She's smart and brave, so she's totally my style.

808
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:57,649
If I had a daughter, it would be like her.

809
01:05:57,689 --> 01:06:02,549
- See? My mom really likes you. 
 - Thank you.

810
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,909
But...

811
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:08,269
this marriage...

812
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:15,799
about this marriage...

813
01:06:16,749 --> 01:06:19,139
I'm against this marriage.

814
01:06:21,399 --> 01:06:22,999
Mom!

815
01:06:23,429 --> 01:06:27,639
You guys can't get married!

816
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:29,679
Why not!

817
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:32,739
Just no!

818
01:06:45,399 --> 01:06:49,789

819
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:53,699

826
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:23,199
     

827
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:25,899
  I brought this back.  

828
01:07:25,999 --> 01:07:30,099
  I'm so surprised. I don't know what to say.  

829
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:33,099
  Oh, president! You became so handsome!  

830
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:36,899
  That cheeky little boy! You'll be surprised when you see me again.  

831
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:38,569
  I look like James Dean, right?  

832
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:41,389
  Are you going to marry Man Jung?  

833
01:07:41,419 --> 01:07:42,919
  She's very ambitious person.  

834
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:45,809
  How did she ended up with...  

835
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:48,999
  - So you want me to intercept this contract? 
 - Help me with this, grandmother.  

836
01:07:49,009 --> 01:07:51,709
  This might completely ruin his company.   

837
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:56,759
  - I think I'm going to make a big contract. 
 - You have to be cautious!  

838
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,399
  Don't worry about it. I can handle this.  

839
01:07:58,499 --> 01:08:01,699
  I think I should quit my work.  

840
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:04,379
  My Seo Yeon is getting married?  

841
01:08:04,419 --> 01:08:08,019
  I will show up amazingly to the wedding!
