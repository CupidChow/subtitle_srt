1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,070
  Are you okay, Soon Jung?  

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,680
     

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,670
Yes.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,900
You must've been startled since it's been so long since we've met.

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,500
Actually, I was so surprised as well.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,600
How can we meet each other in this kind of place?

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,030
When I visited this house last year, you weren't here.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,110
Ah, yes...

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,750
I think that was the time when I was having some break from work.

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,000
That was why.

11
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,070
It's so good to see you.

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,970
You didn't change at all!

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,980
You as well, young lady.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,500
How are your children? I bet they're all grown up, right?

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,400
Do you have a son or daughter?

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,840
I have two daughters and a son.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,700
You are very lucky.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,900
I have a son and a daughter.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,600
  My daughter looks exactly the same as me.  

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,260
Ah, yes.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,100
If your daughters look like you, then they must be beautiful as well.

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,600
It's just...

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,300
Noonim, are you okay? Here, have some water.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,100
Thank you.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,600
He's my coworker.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,500
This is the young lady that I used to know.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,900
- Stop calling me young lady, I'm too old for that now. 
 - Ah, young lady...

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,300
Nice to meet you. I'm a sing-a-song-writer Kim Hwak Se.

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,180
Nice to meet you as well.

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,060
I was in the middle of my work...

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,270
Don't worry about that. I'll serve the food, so you two should keep talking.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,100
No, I have a lot of things to do.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,700
Yes, you should go back to work. Let's talk again later.

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,500
Yes, yes.

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,110
I'm so glad to see you again, Soon Jung.

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,780
Yes, me too.

37
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,790
Oh my, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,230
I thought you were a pervert. Because I heard there's a pervert keep going around in this neighborhood.

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,770
- I heard that pervert got caught this morning. 
 - Is that so?

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,100
- That guy got caught! 
 - I don't even have that much of a hair and what a loss...

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Then, why don't you put this ointment at least?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,700
Ah, thank you.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,100
You are the 'phone,' right?

44
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,520
What's that?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Yes, I'm right! You know, that guy who brought the lost cell phone the other day to our office.

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,910
Really? Are you really the one who brought my lost cell phone?

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
What cell phone..?

48
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,870
You are the one! I remember people's faces if I see them once. You know, my nickname is Sherlock.

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,600
If I see something on the street, then I try to find the owner right away, but there were so many of those cases.

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,700
This is the one. Do you remember this?

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,500
Ah, this one!

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,350
- Wow! 
 - What?

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,600
Thank you so much! I'm a freelancer, so my phone really means a lot to me.

54
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,000
On that day, I ran out to say thank you right away when I got this.

55
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,100
But then, you were already gone. Wow, this is unbelievable.

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I guess you are destined to meet with us, oppa.

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,700
I guess so.

58
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,200
That's so strange. They say continuous coincidence means inevitable.

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,300
That's right.

60
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,720
This is too much of a coincidence, even from my perspective.

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,600
- If somebody hears about this, then they'll think I staged all this stuff. 
 - I know!

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,280
Anyway, it's nice to meet you. I'm the one who moved into the lower floor room, Hwang Na Ro.

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes, nice to meet you, too! I'm this family's oldest daughter, Lee Bit Chae Woon!

64
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,000
- Bit Chae Woon? 
 - Yes.

65
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,410
Wow, your name is very pretty.

66
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,860
Right?

67
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,200
  You can call me simply Bit Chae or Chae Woon.  

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,200
If you need anything, please don't hesitate and ask me.

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,900
Thank you.

70
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,500
  What should I do?  

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,700
Oh no, are you still not feeling alright?

72
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,500
No, I'm fine.

73
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,600
Oh, no, Noonim! Just stay there!

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,570
- I'll take care of it. Just stay right there. 
 - What should I do?

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,500
  What's going on?  

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,900
What's wrong with you today? Is there something going on in your family?

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I'm really sorry.

78
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,400
Ma'am, she's really not feeling great today. I'm so sorry, ma'am.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,900
Soon Jung! Are you okay?

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm fine...

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh, well. I think you should go home early tonight.

82
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,180
No, ma'am. I'm fine.

83
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,100
Yes, Soon Jung. You should go home and rest. Look at your face!

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,200
- Noonim! 
 - You should go back inside. We should get ready for dessert soon.

85
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,500
Are you sure you can go home by yourself?

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,500
- There're guests. Go back inside. 
 - I'm really worried about you!

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,400
Soon Jung! Let's go together!

88
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,200
Are you leaving already, young lady?

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,300
I'm worried about you. You should get in my car, I'll take you home.

90
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,000
No, I'm fine. I can take a cab home.

91
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,200
You should do that, Noonim. Then I can work without worrying about you.

92
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,320
Yes, let's go together.

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
- I'm fine... 
 - We'll get going. It's totally fine.

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,100
- Hwak Se... 
 - Have a good night. Thank you so much, ma'am!

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,100
- Your welcome! 
 - Have a good night.

96
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm so happy to see you again. Let's go.

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,100
Soon Jung.

98
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,800
Sit comfortably like this.

99
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,500
Yes.

100
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,270
Soon Jung, is your health okay?

101
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,600
Yes, I'm healthy.

102
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,280
How about you?

103
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm always working out. At our age, being healthy is the best luck. Isn't that true, chief?

104
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,400
Yes, boss.

105
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Soon Jung, you had beautiful hair when you were young, and you still have.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,490
And you still have beautiful skin as well.

107
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,100
You were the most beautiful woman, young lady.

108
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,030
You were the Audrey Hepburn in Onsan-dong.

109
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,480
What are you talking about? That's embarrassing.

110
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,400
This brings back old memories. Do you remember Min Jae?

111
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,070
Whenever Min Jae was coming to our place you came together.

112
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,370
Ah, yes, that's right.

113
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,620
The bread you made at that time was really amazing.

114
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,070
  Jung Won!  

115
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,030
  Min Jae!  

116
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,000
  When did you come?  

117
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,000
  - Soon Jung came together! 
 - Hello, young lady.  

118
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,400
  - I brought some bread that I made. 
 - That sounds delicious!  

119
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,700
  - That looks so good! 
 - It looks delicious!  

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,500
  - It's amazing. 
 - Please, have some.  

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,300
  - Is it good? 
 - Just try one.  

122
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,430
Min Jae always said she's on a diet, but then always ate a lot.

123
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,470
You don't have to get off from the car for me.

124
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,890
I came all the way here and you're not going to give me some tea at least?

125
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,220
I'm sorry?

126
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,930
Just kidding.

127
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,640
You still get surprised when I play jokes on you.

128
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,790
Where is your place? Is it this one?

129
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,200
- Ah, yes. 
 - It's a pretty place!

130
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,800
You should go inside and get some rest. Let's catch up next time.

131
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,800
Yes. Thank you for the ride. Have a safe trip back home.

132
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,600
- Bye. Get some rest! 
 - Yes.

133
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,600
I should get myself together.

134
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,350
Get yourself together, Lee Soon Jung.

135
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Where am I?

136
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,900
  I think it would be nice if you can research and give a presentation about the project we just discussed. Can you do it?  

137
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,200
     

138
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,100
Mom! You came home late!

139
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,500
Was there a party tonight as well?

140
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,900
Yes...

141
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,800
- Mom! 
 - You're home.

142
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,650
Ah, yes.

143
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,050
Are you sick, mom?

144
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,660
  Your face is pale.  

145
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,310
- No, I'm fine. 
 - That's true. Are you having an indigestion problem again, mom?

146
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,870
Hey, bring some medicine!

147
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,370
No, no, I'm fine!

148
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,800
Mom, let's go inside to the bedroom. Hey, bring some hot washcloth, and you should get ready for bed. 
   - Yes, yes.  

149
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,280
My goodness...

150
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,400
Aigoo, I'm not sick! I shouldn't lie down before taking a shower.

151
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,000
- Lie down, lie down! 
 - We'll wash you, so just lie down first. Hey, Lee Hae Deun, mom's legs.

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,890
Sure!

153
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,840
- It's hot, it's hot, it's hot! 
 - Be careful!

154
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,290
You should've put this in a bowl or something!

155
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,100
- Aigoo, my goodness. 
 - Mom, give me your hands!

156
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,220
Aigo, you guys.

157
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,040
How is it? It feels good, right?

158
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,450
Your exhaustion of the day goes away, right?

159
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,100
- Should I massage your feet? 
 - No.

160
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm going to take a shower.

161
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,520
Nobody can stop our neat-freak, Lee Soon Jung.

162
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,900
In that case, I'll just do this. Here.

163
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,830
Did you have a hard time today?

164
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,100
Aigo, it was fine today. You are making an unnecessary fuss.

165
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,500
Lee Hae Deun, you're not doing it right.

166
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm always doing the hard work, and she's just giving out orders all the time.

167
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,000
- What did you just say? 
 - Nothing.

168
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,590
You should focus on the bones, not the muscles.

169
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,270
  Then you should do it for yourself! I want to put my cheeks on to mom as well!  

170
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,410
  You should do this right first to do that!  

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,600
Lee Bit Chae Woon is such a dictator!

172
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,170
Then you should've born as the first-born.

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,590
I might have been the first-born from my biological parents!

174
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,100
Be quiet, Lee Hae Deun! Mom might hear you!

175
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,000
You should go back to work. You said there's an important presentation tomorrow.

176
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,470
Right.

177
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,400
Mom, something happened today, right?

178
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,960
What would have been?

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,100
Nothing happened.

180
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,100
No, it doesn't seem like that.

181
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,800
What's going on? You should tell me for you to feel better.

182
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,400
I'll take off your load.

183
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,200
No, it's not like that.

184
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,510
I met somebody today. A person that I knew before.

185
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,800
A debt collector?

186
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:54,800
No. A person that I was close to before.

187
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,180
If it was a person you were close to, why do you look so grim?

188
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,310
I guess that person's not well these days.

189
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
No, it's not like that.

190
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,500
It just...

191
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,500
It just brought back some old memories.

192
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,100
  Because I feel sorry for them.  

193
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,300
You mean, the time when you were having a hard time?

194
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,800
I get it. That's why my mom was not feeling great.

195
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,100
My precious Soon Jung!

196
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,300
You have us! Hae Deun, Ra Hoon, and me! Right?

197
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,630
  Because I feel sorry for our Chae Woon.  

198
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,510
  I think my mom is fine now. So don't worry and go to sleep.  

199
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,800
  Are you on the way to coming home?  

200
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,670
  That's great. I'm on my way. I'll see you later.  

201
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,610
Aunt?

202
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
Oh my god!

203
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,900
You surprised me..!

204
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,500
I told you not to try to attack me.

205
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,700
  You can't even stand up?  

206
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
- Hold on to me! 
 - I'm fine!

207
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,120
It's not fine!

208
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,540
♫   Don't ask me, don't ask my age   ♫

209
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,900
♫   This fall, I'm going to fall in love   ♫

210
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
Wow, alcohol smell.

211
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,800
I can't drink anymore!

212
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,100
Let's have some more drinks! No, I'm joking.

213
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,440
- You know that, right? 
 - What about it?

214
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,880
Shut the mouth.

215
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,510
I really don't understand what you're trying to say.

216
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,300
If you talk about when you saw me in the hospital somewhere else, I'm going to do this. You know what this means, right?

217
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
Aunt.

218
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,960
Are you okay?

219
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,250
Should I help you with anything?

220
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,100
It's none of your business.

221
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,210
I'm an idiot.

222
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,930
Can I take water like this?

223
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,120
Yes, sure.

224
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
Ah, there're juices as well.

225
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:20,020
My mom made all of these. They have labels on the bottle, so you can drink what you want.

226
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,290
Wow, it must be a lot of work to make all these.

227
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,530
I know. We can't stop her.

228
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,170
Ah, the fruits are in this section.

229
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Fruits are pretty expensive, so the amount that we provide per week is limited, but it wouldn't be short.

230
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,670
Ah, yes. I'm not a big fan of fruits, so it's fine.

231
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,700
It's Kamiel Fortgens.

232
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
Do you work in this industry?

233
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
No, but I'm just excited to see the Dutch brand.

234
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
I used to live in the Netherlands when I was a kid.

235
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Wow, then you must be good at speaking Dutch.

236
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,800
Well, I speak English and Dutch, and I live off from that.

237
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,820
I do translation work.

238
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,200
Wow, that's really awesome.

239
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,400
Well, if you see any words that you don't know, then ask me anytime.

240
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,100
Yes, I will!

241
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm so sorry...

242
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,800
- Does it hurt? 
 - I didn't get hurt~

243
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,500
My goodness. You surprised me! You're funny.

244
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,700
Oh, by the way, about finding my lost phone, I was really thankful, so I want to treat you. What kind of food do you like?

245
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,290
Is it like a gratitude chance?

246
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,840
What do I like?

247
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,600
I should think about it.

248
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,220
Anyway, Ik zal verwachten.

249
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,840
I think I know what that means.

250
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
It means I'll look forward to it, right?

251
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,120
- Antwoord! 
 - Ah, it's correct!

252
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,820
You're good at this!

253
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,600
- I have good sense. 
 - Yes, you do.

254
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,720
No, no, I'm done now.

255
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,200
Presentation?

256
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,520
If your workout is done, you should go inside!

257
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Let me see.

258
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,580
I think it will be better if you make this part into two pages.

259
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,100
  I was the god of presentation.  

260
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,700
After all, the reason why they want you to do this kind of presentation is to see if it is feasible.

261
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,460
So, this part. It will be better if you emphasize this part.

262
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,770
But shouldn't we still focus on persuasion?

263
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,930
That's theoretical. If you present it like this, your boss will probably say this.

264
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ms. Lee Bit Chae Woon, are we in school? Are you presenting your homework right now?

265
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,220
Wow. You're really similar to my boss.

266
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
What's that?

267
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,700
Ah, my director.

268
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,340
As if you know each other well.

269
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,500
If I start talking about this, it'll be a long story. In fact, ah, the director--

270
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,820
Alright! I'm going to work now. Thank you so much.

271
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,940
Good luck.

272
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,800
Excuse me.

273
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,100
- Excuse me. 
 - What is it this time?

274
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,400
Where do you think women would want to go when they leave the house?

275
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,400
Who are you talking about it? A high school girl? Is it your sister?

276
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I'm an only child. About in their mid to late 50s? This is not my family's story.

277
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,700
Ah, your mother left the house.

278
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,510
No, she's not.

279
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,910
I don't know as well.

280
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,500
Wouldn't she go to the place where she wanted to go to before?

281
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,500
A place that was in her mind every day.

282
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:32,700
A place where she wanted to go after saying, 'Ah, whatever, forget about it!'

283
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,770
Even if it's not a fancy expensive place, but where your mother can find peace in her mind.

284
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,010
I said it's not my mother! Why are you keep saying as if it's about my mother?

285
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:48,140
I think inside of your memory will have a hint for it, Mr. Koala.

286
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,230
A hint... Koala...

287
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Koala?

288
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,800
Now I think about it, you called me like that before, too.

289
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,800
  - Headbutt? 
 - Koala?  

290
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,430
You called me Koala before as well. Why am I a koala?

291
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
What about you? Headbutt?

292
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,600
Why am I a headbutt? I have a beautiful forehead!

293
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,230
I'm the one to say that. I never heard someone calling me a koala.

294
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,030
Do you know what my aunts call me? They say I look like Alain Delon. Have you ever heard of that name? Alain Delon.

295
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,300
I never heard that name before. But why the hell am I a headbutt?!

296
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,780
Don't you remember that time? You headbutt me at the site, and I fainted immediately.

297
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,120
Your headbutt power was insane today as well. It's a weapon.

298
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,480
After that day, I got dizziness. I should've dealt that as an industrial accident.

299
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,060
You should! You should deal with it as an industrial accident, now!

300
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,320
- I'm really going to do it then! 
   - I'm going to do it, too!  

301
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,590
  Either way, just focus on that presentation.  

302
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,950
  - Then you should go inside! How can I focus on this when you keep talking about headbutt and stuff! 
 - I'm just getting some fresh air.  

303
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,500
  - Then you should go outside of the house to get some fresh air! 
 - Then you should come with me to go to that supermarket and have some beer.  

304
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,050
  Why do I have to come with you? You're a ridiculous person!  

305
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,930
When did you guys clean this storage room?

306
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,460
This morning. Mom said she can't sleep with auntie at all.

307
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,400
- Auntie also agreed to this arrangement. 
 - Shut the mouth!

308
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,120
  Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon...  

309
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,960
  I think somebody took our Seo Yeon.  

310
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:58,100
  I decide not to think about that anymore. Maybe it's because I met Soon Jung?  

311
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,400
  Seo Yeon.  

312
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,010
  I miss you.  

313
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,000
     

314
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,620
What's this?

315
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,820
  It's a hand-out. I thought you wouldn't have time to make this as well.  

316
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,570
  Older people like to see the summary, so print this out and hand it to them.  

317
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,130
  And don't stupidly print the whole PowerPoint!  

318
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,300
  Koala.  

319
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,820
What's going on with him?

320
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
It's pretty nice.

321
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,100
    
    

322
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,700
Headbutt.

323
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,350
She must have been impressed a little bit.

324
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,800
Is her nose okay with making a sound like that?

325
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,070
I can't hear it anymore!

326
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,300
  Mom, I hope you're doing well.  

327
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,150
  I'm worried about you. Please call me often, promise.  

328
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,500
Really! For god's sake...

329
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,800
     

330
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,950
  You have to be strong, Lee Soon Jung.  

331
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,220
  It was inevitable.  

332
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,300
It was inevitable at that time.

333
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,800
It was inevitable.

334
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm thankful that our Noonim is not majorly sick.

335
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,340
Of course. Our family is all man of steel!

336
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,400
- The body is a fortune! 
 - Beauty is extra.

337
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,190
Owner, are you sick?

338
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,390
No, I'm fine. Our kids are making a big deal.

339
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,060
Na Ro, eat as much as you want.

340
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,400
Yes, it's really delicious. It feels like a mother's cooking.

341
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,350
I guess your mother is an amazing cook as well!

342
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,120
I don't know. My step-mother was an okay-cook.

343
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,050
I wonder if my biological mother was good at cooking.

344
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,400
Ah, I got adopted to the Netherlands when I was young.

345
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,000
I guess you're really meant to meet with us. We are all--

346
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,990
That's why you are fluent in Dutch.

347
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,850
I believe your mother must be good at cooking as well.

348
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,810
- I hope so. 
   - I believe so.  

349
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,600
Here, Na Ro. Have some more.

350
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,160
Thank you.

351
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:10,280
- From now on, just think our Noonim is your real mother and take it easy. 
 - Yes, sir!

352
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,070
Then, can I call you mother?

353
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,410
It's weird to call you an owner or an ahjumunny.

354
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,130
Yes, then call me like that.

355
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
Thank you, mother.

356
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,140
I'm really happy!

357
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,700
My mother all of a sudden got a handsome son!

358
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,700
What about me? I'm a really really handsome son!

359
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,500
Okay, okay, then to celebrate our Noonim got a handsome son, let's give a morning round of applause!

360
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,390
Let's eat!

361
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,310
Good morning!

362
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,360
Is it somebody's birthday today? Why are you guys clapping from the morning?

363
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
  - Have a seat here. 
 - Good morning!  

364
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,350
Did you sleep okay, Mr. Woo?

365
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,720
Hwak Se, you have a crazy dark circle on your face.

366
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,200
As a person who goes on stages, you need to take care of yourself more. That's a problem.

367
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,700
I have to take care of myself?

368
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,200
  Do you know why I look like this right now?  

369
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,420
  - I couldn't sleep at all last night because of somebody!   
 - Ah-ha!

370
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,020
  This is the new guy!  

371
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,680
Nice to meet you, I'm Lee Man Jung.

372
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,300
- She's a doctor. 
 - Yes.

373
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,950
Hello, I'm Hwang Na Ro. It's very nice to meet you.

374
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,700
You look familiar. Did we meet somewhere else?

375
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,010
- This is the first time for me to see you. 
   - Is that so?  

376
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,730
Maybe you found something on the street and gave it to her as well?

377
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,500
Aigoo, she's pranking on you. Don't think about it too much, Na Ro. She likes to do that a lot.

378
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,000
Na Ro oppa's face turned red! He's so cute!

379
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,760
  What's that?  

380
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,520
  Ah, I'm dizzy.  

381
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,200
Jung Min Jae. I'm not going to forgive you.

382
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
I'm not going to forgive you at all.

383
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:48,200
♫   The rain is falling softly   ♫

384
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,600
♫   And sit on top of my closed eyes   ♫

385
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:01,380
♫   Like old radio songs,   ♫

386
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,900
♫   it makes me rest   ♫

387
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,400
♫   In this sleepy sunlight, the songs that are like dust   ♫

388
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:21,740
♫   As if they are my old friends, I fall asleep again   ♫

389
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,000
Aigoo, Na Ro, why are you vacuuming the house? Let me do it.

390
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,640
Mother, I'll do it. I'm good at cleaning the house.

391
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Also, I'm almost done.

392
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Now, I'm done with the vacuum, and now it's time for this, right?

393
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:55,140
Then, just do it only until this. Okay?

394
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,400
No, I'm going to do everything.

395
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,280
Aigo... Then, I'm not going to be your mother anymore.

396
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:07,500
That's not good. Then I'm not going to do it anymore.

397
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,170
One second, please.

398
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,100
     

399
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,520
Hello?

400
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm sorry.

401
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,790
Aigoo, he's good at foreign languages.

402
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,450
Did you find it out?

403
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,360
Really?

404
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,700
The ex-wife of Pil Hong

405
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,320
is Kim Jung Won? Are you sure about that?

406
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,400
So, Lee Bit Chae Woon is the daughter of this company's owner.

407
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,800
Then, I'm going to be this place's...

408
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,480
future son-in-law.

409
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,700
I like that. I like it a lot.

410
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,620
Don't be nervous, Bit Chae Woon!

411
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,750
You can do it!

412
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,300
Supervisor! I'll start setting up for the conference.

413
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,610
Ms. Bit Chae Woon, I'm sorry to say this, but today's conference got canceled.

414
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,780
Why?

415
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,840
Director Jang Seo Ah got an external meeting all of a sudden.

416
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,850
But instead, please do the market research of the day.

417
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,600
What the hell? She said I should hurry up and do this.

418
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,400
It feels a bit suspicious.

419
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,100
Are you going to...

420
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,100
It wouldn't be like that, right? We are not middle school kids anymore.

421
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,100
Ah, whatever. Let's do the work.

422
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,960
- I heard you were looking for me. 
 - Yes, I was.

423
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,100
- I saw the finishing of this corner was a little bit off. So, re-doing this and check if this quantity is right. 
 - Okay, I got it.

424
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:45,150
  Wouldn't she go to the place where she wanted to go to  before?  

425
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Where my mom wanted to go before was a department store, spa, library, and zoo.

426
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,400
We were only planning to go to the zoo the whole time.

427
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,370
You're a bad son, a bad son, Koala.

428
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,220
Koala?

429
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,900
     

430
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,700
Jung Min Jae. You lost your deadline.

431
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,100
Even if you come back home with your own will and beg to be taken back, I'm not going to take you back anymore.

432
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,500
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo?

433
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,000
Who the hell are you guys?

434
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,900
We're from Seodaemun Police Station.

435
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,200
Woo Jung Hoo is under arrest without a warrant as a prime suspect in the disappearance of your wife, Jung Min Jae.

436
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,080
Why am I a suspect? My wife left the house with her own will!

437
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,700
- Let's go. 
 - Let me go! Let me go! Get off from me!!

438
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,500
- My goodness! 
 - Oh, well.

439
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,690
You couldn't sleep last night?

440
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,040
Why are you taking a nap in the office?

441
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,700
Didn't you know that I'm suffering from insomnia?

442
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,500
How can a person who's running a business sleep well at night?

443
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:23,720
I guess you must sleep well at night, brother-in-law. You don't have your own family nor philosophical agonies.

444
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,600
What's this?

445
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,600
It's a shirt. I saw your shirt earlier today at the conference, and it was very dirty.

446
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,690
It's not dirty at all...

447
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,500
I guess you wore that for like three days straight, right? Or is it for four days?

448
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
Is it from my wife?

449
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,360
I didn't hear anything from her. I heard that she left the house from Jae Hee.

450
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,730
- You're all in the same boat, aren't you? 
 - No! I'm not!

451
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,830
Be careful. I'm watching all of you guys.

452
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,700
That's a waste of money. Take it back with you!

453
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,900
I bought it with my own money. I wouldn't ask you to pay me back, so please just take it.

454
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,400
Brother-in-law! Your undershirt!

455
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,600
Get out. Get out of here!

456
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,250
I wonder if you changed your underwear at all.

457
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,600
My god! Jae Hee's mother! Oh!

458
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:50,700
  Besides the zoo, I want to go...  

459
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,000
  this place.  

460
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,710
  Oh, Hanok! It looks amazing!  

461
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
  Looks nice, right?  

462
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:07,520
  Ah, if I can go to a place like this and have some rest for a couple of days, I would be happy.  

463
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,200
Oppa!

464
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,300
Seo Ah! Why are you here?

465
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,370
I had tea here before with your mother.

466
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,550
I was really worried about her, so I came here in case she might be here. Oppa as well?

467
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,510
Wow, we have the same thoughts! Right? Let's go inside.

468
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,500
Wait for a second, Seo Ah.

469
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,100
Again? If you say I shouldn't be involved because it's your family's problem, I'm really going to be upset.

470
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,690
I'm sorry, but only for this time.  I don't think my mom would want to show you this moment as well.

471
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Why? I'm really close with your mother.

472
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,120
- I'm coming in. 
 - Wait, Seo Ah.

473
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,800
- Come here for a second. 
 - I'm close to your mother!

474
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,600
- Come here for a second! 
 - I came here with her often to have tea!

475
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm sorry. Come here for a second!

476
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,210
Mom!

477
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,880
Jae Hee's mother?

478
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,200
Mother! I missed you! I was really worried about you!

479
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,670
I really missed you so much, mother!

480
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,690
Wow, it's very pretty here.

481
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,400
Are you relieved now?

482
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,520
Are you healthy and everything?

483
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm great! As you can see.

484
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,920
  Mother!  

485
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,800
- That looks very expensive. 
 - Wait, wait.

486
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,200
Let's hang out until now for today. I have to go out.

487
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,140
Let's have lunch together. I have a lot of things to talk to you.

488
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,450
Let's do it next time. I have a lunch plan.

489
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,000
Thank you for coming, Seo Ah.

490
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,600
You are not going to tell this to your mom, right?

491
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,160
I trust you won't tell her.

492
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,500
I won't tell her.

493
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,800
You guys should look around this place. There's a lot of things to look at here. Then, I'll get going.

494
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,970
Mom!

495
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,820
What was that? Is she really my mom?

496
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Yes, CEO. I found her.

497
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
Did you find her?

498
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,960
Alright. Keep following her.

499
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:44,040
I knew following Jae Hee would give some results.

500
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,900
This woman, I'm going to...

501
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,880
Manager.

502
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,200
I moved everything.

503
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,700
No, there's more. It's in the second basement level storage room.

504
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,480
- The second basement level? 
    - Yes.  

505
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,950
When are we going to do the survey on consumer preference? I have to go to the other stores as well.

506
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,640
A survey? I didn't hear about that.

507
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,970
- I heard they are sending an employee to organize the storage room. 
 - Who said that?

508
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,160
Supervisor Yoon Da Hee.

509
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,300
Welcome!

510
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,200
Then, how can I go down to the second basement level?

511
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,400
It's nice to go out on a date with you in a while, oppa.

512
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,120
Don't worry too much, oppa.

513
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,480
Your mother looked way better than before.

514
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,720
Oh, really? She didn't look depressed or something?

515
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:03,380
No. She looked prettier. Maybe she got a new boyfriend?

516
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,080
Hey, Jang Seo Ah!

517
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,390
I'm just joking.

518
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,090
Oppa, let's have lunch together.

519
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,900
Let's eat together. Yes?  Oppa~

520
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,600
Ah, right. Didn't your office hire a new designer?

521
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,500
Because of that, I'm really annoyed these days.

522
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,960
Why?

523
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,900
I told you there was a bully when I was in middle school. Who ended up dropping out of school.

524
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,910
Right.

525
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,100
This time, she came in as a new intern.

526
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,800
Whenever I see her, she makes me think of the old times and makes me uncomfortable.

527
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,200
  Is it going to be the headbutt? I doubt it.   

528
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,200
How many new interns came in?

529
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,500
It's two public contest winners. One male and one female.

530
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,300
Are you okay?

531
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,260
That woman intern is the one who bullied you before?

532
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,110
Yes!

533
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,550
  Really? It's the headbutt?  

534
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,690
Ah, I'm starving.

535
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,600
A beef-bone soup? I should eat something first.

536
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:24,090
I tried my best to not see her at all.

537
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,630
But it didn't work out that way.

538
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:34,810
That headbutt, no, no... Is that person still being like the old times to you?

539
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:39,330
She looks fine from the outside. Now she's an adult after all.

540
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,800
- But whenever I see her, I get so annoyed. 
 - Annoyed?

541
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,390
It's not like you're afraid of her?

542
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,990
I'm scared of her and that's why I'm annoyed at her...

543
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,180
  Welcome!  

544
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,600
Oppa, what's wrong?

545
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,800
Let's go.

546
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We haven't finished our food yet.

547
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,300
No, it's not like... Let's just go.

548
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,180
Are we just leaving?

549
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,110
- One beef-bone soup, please! 
   - Yes!  

550
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,740
How can they just send up a person without any basis as a trainee?

551
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,840
I'm sorry. I'll practice harder.

552
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,150
You're practicing hard. In this group of people, you work the hardest.

553
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,290
But this is not the thing that you can do by just working hard.

554
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,900
Is it here?

555
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,140
I hope everyone likes this.

556
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,300
  Ms. Hae Deun.  

557
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,970
Why don't you look for something else?

558
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,990
Look. Because of you, everybody's practice gets delayed.

559
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,500
Teacher, I'll work harder.

560
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,150
It's because I haven't danced in a while.

561
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,990
I heard I was a good dancer before. I'll work really harder.

562
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,240
  - Let's take a 20-minute break! 
 - Yes!  

563
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,900
Hey, I heard that Lee Hae Deun unni is a serpent of this company. A serpent trainee.

564
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,100
I know, I guess she doesn't know her place.   How is she going to debut in her age?  

565
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:42,840
  - You know because of Hae Deun unni our practice time got delayed...   
 - Why is this person not coming out? Excuse me!

566
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:50,200
  - I know. 
 - Did you see her dancing? She was doing it like this!  

567
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,540
That's not the problem. Look at me.

568
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:03,200
I can really work harder.   Teacher, I can work harder.  

569
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,290
  Oh my god, you look exactly the same.  

570
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,330
  I mean, who can't work hard? If that's all it takes, then everybody can be an idol.  

571
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,300
  - I can really work harder! 
 - You look exactly the same!  

572
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,750
Who can't work hard? Then, everybody can be an idol.

573
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,150
Sorry.

574
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,960
  She's acting like a star.  

575
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:57,560
- This is very delicious! 
   - It's amazing!  

576
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:03,400
  - Thank you for the food! 
 - Thank you!  

577
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,350
- It's really amazing! 
 - Have a lot. 
   - Thank you!  

578
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,100
Mom! 
   - Please, have some.  

579
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,670
Hae Deun.

580
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:25,120
This is our trainer! She's really nice to me. All the kids are nice as well.

581
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,800
  Thank you so much.  

582
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,180
Our Hae Deun was very worried that she's the oldest.

583
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:38,200
- Thank you so much. Please, take good care of her. 
  - Ah, yes.

584
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:43,350
- Ah, teacher, have some of this as well. 
 - Lee Hae Deun, you have to be nice to your mother.

585
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,460
Aigo, Hae Deun!

586
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,010
Thank you so much, mom.

587
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,760
Oh, well. Don't be discouraged! Okay?

588
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,400
Our Hae Deun can do anything.

589
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,030
You're doing great. It's okay.

590
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,370
You're really great, Hae Deun!

591
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,000
It's okay. It's okay.

592
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,860
You'll do it great.

593
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,800
It's okay. Alright? It's okay.

594
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,200
Put some strength in!

595
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,700
  You're doing great!  

596
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,970
  - You did great! 
 - You worked hard!  

597
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,220
Are you okay?

598
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,850
Yes.

599
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,400
  I'm new here.  

600
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,800
- Oh? You're here! Welcome. 
 - Hello.

601
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,370
- That guy is also in the business major. Lee Ra Hoon. 
   - Oh, really?  

602
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,590
  But who is he?  

603
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:22,590
  Ah! You don't know him because you just came back from the military. He just got in school in 2020.  

604
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,400
Lee Ra Hoon! Where did he go?

605
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,900
That was a close one. Stop now! Stop!

606
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,800
My goodness!

607
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,070
Where are you going?

608
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,380
What?

609
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:09,880
Oh, I was going to quit the club activity. I just don't think it suits me.

610
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,500
- Is that so? 
 - Yes, I'm sorry.

611
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,800
Well, what can I do.

612
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,600
Yes, right. Thank you. Bye!

613
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,300
You!

614
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,600
- You can quit the club, but... 
 - Yes?

615
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,200
But don't disappear from my eyesight.

616
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,600
Why?

617
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,300
Because I like you.

618
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,400
  It can't be.  

619
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,860
It can't be, it can't be.

620
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,200
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry! 
 - Hey!

621
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,500
Lee Ra Hoon!

622
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:14,260
  - I told you there was a bully when I was in middle school. Who ended up dropping out of school. 
 - Right.  

623
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,980
  This time, she came in as a new intern.  

624
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,800
Is the headbutt really...

625
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,460
Oh?

626
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,000
Did I surprise you too much? I'm sorry.

627
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,800
What is it!

628
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,800
What's that? It's dangerous!

629
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,070
Koala?

630
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It was just a car passing.

631
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,300
- It wasn't dangerous at all. 
 - I'm sorry.

632
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,280
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

633
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,340
I saw you walking from over there. You looked exhausted. Was there something bad thing happened today?

634
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,250
Ah, well. Just a little bit?

635
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,920
That gratitude chance coupon, can I use that tonight?

636
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,200
Ah, what should I do? I already ate dinner.

637
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:29,860
Ah! I ate already as well. Then, what about a drink?

638
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:36,230
I'm sorry, Na Ro. I'm really tired tonight.

639
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:41,100
It's okay. Tonight is not the only day.

640
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,000
Let's have it next time!

641
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,700
Okay.

642
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,020
When you're in a bad mood, this is the medicine!

643
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,350
Why can't I do this?

644
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,370
How was the presentation?

645
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,400
Yes, because of your help. Thank you.

646
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,700
Ah! Did you find your mother?

647
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,600
I said it's not about my mother.

648
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,700
Right. A woman in her 50s that you know.

649
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,010
Yes, with your help.

650
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,570
Oh, that's great! How is your mother?

651
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,000
Ah, sorry. It's not your mother.

652
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,240
But you found her right away! That's great.

653
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,800
Why is she calling me?

654
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,880
Yes, what's up, Lee Hae Deun?

655
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:04,160
You are digging my closet again! Wait right there!

656
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,670
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

657
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:15,900
  Do you know how bright and fine face she puts on and treats me? She's like a sociopath.  

658
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,300
What's wrong?

659
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,100
- Nothing. You're very bright and looks fine. 
 - Okay.

660
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,460
I'm bright and fine, from the outside.

661
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,700
From the outside...

662
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,800
  Jae Hee, can't you tell me where your mother is?  

663
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,710
  She's my best friend. Please, tell me.  

664
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,600
I want the place to have an open view.

665
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,350
It should have high ceilings and flooded with sunlight.

666
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,000
I want a modern house with a kitchen built-in with high-tech appliances.

667
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:06,600
The dishwasher is a must.

668
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:12,590
- I'll look for the apartment on the condition you mentioned. 
   - Hey! Get real!  

669
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:19,240
An apartment with an open view, high ceilings and have built-in high-tech appliances. Do you know how expensive that will be?

670
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,700
I know about that.

671
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,000
But, who is he?

672
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:28,300
- Me? I'm her husband-- 
 - He's just a guy that I know. Don't worry about him.

673
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,630
Just keep looking for a place.

674
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,470
You're getting a place?

675
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,840
You already have a fine house, and where did you get that money?

676
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:45,620
I'll make money from now on, and the fine house where Mr. Woo Jung Hoo lives is not my place anymore.

677
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,860
Why don't you go home.

678
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:55,170
I'll get some beef neck-cut that you like after work.

679
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,100
You know, because of you, I came out from the office today, there's a lot of loss--

680
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,370
Let's get a divorce.

681
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,400
- What? 
 - I said, let's get a divorce.

682
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,500
That's cute.

683
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,200
Min Jae. Let's stop this now.

684
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,360
Let's go home.

685
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,000
Did you not understand what I said?

686
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,300
I said, let's get divorced. Woo Jung Hoo, a divorce.

687
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,980
A divorce!

688
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,150
J-Jung Won.

689
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,800
I'm sorry. I begged to Jae Hee.

690
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:00,300
You transformed completely. It's amazing, girl!

691
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,220
M-Min Jae.

692
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,500
Where is the next store?

693
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,200
It's Moonjung-dong.

694
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,100
     

695
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:55,200
  Ms. Bit Chae Woon, if your schedule gets over, don't come back to the office and get off from work.  

696
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,500
At least they have a conscience.

697
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,900
Maybe I should do a bath today.

698
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,400
Don't... come back to the office?

699
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,900
  Thank you!  

700
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,500
- You did amazing. 
 - Thank you so much.

701
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,030
Mr. Kim Rae Won, you did a great job.

702
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,400
Thank you so much.

703
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,300
You prepared it well in a short period of time.

704
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,700
And also...

705
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:49,670
There was a presentation today, but I guess you said I should go home first because I must be exhausted.

706
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:53,210
Thank you for your consideration.

707
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,700
I didn't exclude you intentionally, Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

708
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:06,700
We just had to have an emergency meeting to discuss something in the design team.

709
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,240
It's an emergency meeting, but the intern was giving the presentation.

710
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,670
I must have caught you off guard.

711
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,900
It's because you're trying to keep making excuses.

712
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,600
What?

713
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
Did you forget about it?

714
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,000
The cancellation of my winning at the contest, you covered that up at the very last minute.

715
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,610
I think you would've gone through some trouble at that time.

716
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,650
Bit Chae Woon.

717
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,700
You don't know anything about it, and how can you just make a guess?

718
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:50,000
- The contest was because there was an error at the evaluation team-- 
 - Seo Ah.

719
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,710
Are you that uncomfortable for me to be around you?

720
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:57,770
Is that why you're trying to push me out?

721
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,900
Why do you feel uncomfortable about me?

722
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,800
Can I interpret your discomfort is coming from your guilt?

723
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,900
Guilt?

724
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,580
Yes, guilt.

725
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,100
The discomfort of framing me for school violence and driving me away, that pressure!

726
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,900
You still have those feelings.

727
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:26,510
- Hey! Bit Chae Woon! 
   - Ms. Chae Woon.  

728
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,730
- CEO. 
 - What are you guys doing right now?

729
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,800
  Get yourself together, Director Jang.  

730
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,770
Director!

731
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,200
Ms. Bit Chae Woon. Can you see me for a second?

732
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,400
     

733
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,500
    
    

734
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,300
     

735
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,310
If this is going to work...

736
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:18,010
she shouldn't think her daughter is dead.

737
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,590
I should get this right.

738
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,460
Who's going to do that? I am, this Hwang Na Ro will do that.

739
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,600
Na Ro, let's hurry...

740
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,750
Before Park Pil Hong comes out from the jail.

741
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:40,000
     

742
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,600
  From now on, let's stay in touch often.  

743
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:57,600
  Now that we're getting older, friends from back in the days become very precious.  

744
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,200
  [Young lady Jung Won: "Soon Jung, did you get home safely? I was worried." 
 "Soon Jung, are you okay? Please call me." 
 "Soon Jung- are you playing hard to get? I haven't heard from you. I'm upset." 

745
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,770
Ms. Bit Chae Woon, there's something you're misunderstanding.

746
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,300
That we accepted you easily without any hesitation.

747
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,990
But the truth is,

748
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:39,730
Seo Ah and I had a really difficult time.

749
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:43,340
Until we accepted you.

750
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,540
I figured it was a difficult decision.

751
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,010
Because of that incident from a long time ago.

752
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:56,410
I'm glad that you had a clue.

753
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,900
But...

754
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,690
I also had a really hard time.

755
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,650
I suffered for a long time.

756
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,700
I'm sure you did.

757
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:17,600
Since you were growing up, you must have regretted the things that you've done wrong before.

758
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,000
No, it's not like that.

759
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:24,500
It was hard because I had to leave school because of a false accusation.

760
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,650
A false accusation?

761
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,700
Back then, I

762
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,190
didn't harass Seo Ah.

763
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,950
She is the one who framed me to have a false accusation.

764
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,450
I should have fought back then and said it wasn't me.

765
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,010
I should have persisted and stood my ground until the end,

766
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:49,380
but I regretted not doing that until this day.

767
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,580
I didn't do it.

768
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:58,980
At that time, I hated everything and just wanted to avoid it all.

769
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,900
My household was financially difficult, so I just wanted to quit school and make money,

770
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:09,330
but I regretted so much about running away,

771
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,290
so I suffered for a long time.

772
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,800
You're really a terrible person.

773
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:23,920
You're someone who hasn't reflected on your wrongdoings, doesn't have a conscience.

774
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,200
I didn't know you were this kind of person.

775
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:38,800
I thought your talent was brilliant and felt pity for you struggling to live hard!

776
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,300
     

777
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,600
  Young lady Jung Won.  

778
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,880
  It's me, Soon Jung.  

779
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:05,300
I'm sorry for returning your call so late.

780
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,000
  Soon Jung, I'm sorry.  

781
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,420
I'll call you later.

782
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,240
Is she upset?

783
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,350
You should go out now.

784
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,100
Don't worry.

785
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,570
There won't be any disadvantages because of the past incident.

786
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,100
Please work hard.

787
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,360
Let's try our best.

788
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,680
Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

789
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,300
I mean it.

790
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,500
Back then,

791
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,800
I didn't hit Seo Ah.

792
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:20,870
Back then, you said the same thing as well.

793
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:29,230
Let's stop thinking about what happened in the past.

794
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:37,670
But, I want you to not harass Seo Ah again.

795
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:45,600
Seo Ah is my daughter, who I love the most in this world.

796
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,120
I'm jealous of Seo Ah.

797
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:57,130
Because she has a supportive mother like you.

798
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,720
- I will call you back a little later-- 
   - Are you the CEO Kim Jung Won?  

799
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,300
     

800
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,350
Who is this?

801
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,600
  I'm calling you because I have something to tell you.  

802
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,700
  Your biological daughter, Park Seo Yeon.  

803
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,670
  She's not dead.  

804
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,800
  She's alive.  

805
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,100
She's somewhere very close to you

806
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,650
and living very well.

807
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,700
Don't you miss

808
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,400
your daughter?

809
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:26,500
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

810
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:34,200
♫  Like passing time, you can't stop the heart  ♫

811
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:41,230
♫  You're drawn to each other like the magnets  ♫

812
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:47,000
♫  You part ways leaving a hole in your heart  ♫ 
       

813
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,470
  We have no place to move in.  

814
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,200
  Are you bashing me because I lost the apartment?  

815
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,000
  Auntie, you lost an apartment?  

816
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,800
  So why did you buy it under my name in the first place? I'll disappear from the Samgwang Villa! I'm really sorry!  

817
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,690
  Auntie!  

818
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,000
  Jung Min Jae, you can live confidently by yourself. By yourself!   

819
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,500
  - She has filed a formal divorce suit. 
 - What?  

820
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,400
  My older sister's getting a divorce? Then this company is going to be...  

821
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,100
  What do you think about looking for your real mom?  

822
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,080
  Ms. Bit Chae Woon wasn't her biological daughter? 

823
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,680
  Seo Ah isn't a real daughter either...  

824
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,900
  If you think it's so unfair, then bring evidence instead of acting like a victim.  

825
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,100
  If I bring it, then are you going to admit it?  

826
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,060
  Bring it. If you can make it.  

827
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,650
  Where should I get the evidence?
