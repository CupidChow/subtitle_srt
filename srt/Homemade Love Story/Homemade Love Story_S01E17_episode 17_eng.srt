1
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,880
 

2
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,430
What did you say?

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,580
How can you say such
 nonsense, Soon Jung?

4
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,660
I feel bad saying this, but...

5
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,770
are you...

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,430
having a hard time these 
days, Soon Jung?

7
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,300
Even if you are, I don't like
 kidding around like this.

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,910
You shouldn't say stuff like that.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,000
Park Pil Hong...

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,160
Seo Yeon's father.

11
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,680
At first, he...

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
brought Seo Yeon to me and

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,470
asked me to take care of 
her for a few days.

14
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,530
Seo Yeon's mom isn't 
doing well right now.

15
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,860
She might have postpartum depression.
 She refuses to take care of Seo Yeon.

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,820
Please take care of 
Seo Yeon for a few days.

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,080
My gosh. How can I 
take care of a baby?

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,050
I have no one to ask.

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,880
My mother-in-law is 
hospitalized, too.

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,870
When Jung Won gets better, I'll come
 and get her. Just until then.

21
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,020
Here. Here is your payment.

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,090
Buy whatever you need.

23
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,600
My gosh. No. Don't do this.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,130
I can't accept this.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:06,200
All right then, I'll just take 
care of her for a few days.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,750
All right.

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,820
Thanks, Soon Jung. 
Thank you so much.

28
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,730
I'll leave her in your care.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,270
I made this for her.

30
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,930
You believed him?

31
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,600
Don't you know what kind of 
man Park Pil Hong is?

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Back then...

33
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,050
after Seo Yeon went missing...

34
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,610
Do you know how much...

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,670
Seo Yeon!

36
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,970
Seo Yeon!

37
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,920
Seo Yeon...

38
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,610
I think someone kidnapped Seo Yeon.

39
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,920
 When Park Pil Hong said 
Seo Yeon got kidnapped, 

40
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,380
I just believed him.

41
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,690
I had no idea that took place.

42
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,050
You used to get sick 
often back then.

43
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,460
Even Young Lady Min Jae 
was worried for you, too.

44
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,560
So, I thought...

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,390
you were sick again.

46
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,550
- After that...
- That was it.

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,830
Park Pil Hong and you
 plotted together

48
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,530
and took my daughter Seo Yeon...

49
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,370
You deceived me for 
25 years and raised her?

50
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,690
- Does this make sense?
- No, Young Lady.

51
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,610
No, that's not true.

52
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,410
In reality...

53
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,470
actually...

54
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,630
- your mother...
- How could you do this to me?

55
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,470
Lee Soon Jung, how could you...

56
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,020
How could you?

57
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,950
How could you do that to me?

58
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,470
- How could you do that to me?
- Young Lady...

59
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,870
How could you?

60
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,450
- Mom...
- How could you do that to me?

61
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,350
How could you?

62
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,980
Mom!

63
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,420
What are you doing?

64
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,080
Mom, are you okay?

65
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,720
Are you okay?

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,380
Chae Woon.

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,200
- Why did you come, Chae Woon?
- Mom...

68
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,840
- Mom...
- CEO!

69
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,100
It's okay.

70
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,550
- CEO!
- Young Lady...

71
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,150
- Young Lady!
- CEO!

72
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,660
- Young Lady!
- CEO!

73
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,730
- Young Lady!
- CEO!

74
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,080
Young Lady...

75
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,700
Mom?

76
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,460
To the hospital?

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,260
Director.

78
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,520
Director!

79
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,630
Director!

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,040
Director, where are you going?

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,580
- Na Ro.
- Yes.

82
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,770
- Look at this.
- Oh, okay.

83
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,190
Chae Woon...

84
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,400
Let's go home, Mom.

85
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,610
Oh? Noonim.

86
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,290
Noonim, are you feeling unwell?

87
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,890
Ms. Lee, is something the matter?

88
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,490
No, nothing.

89
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,210
I'm helping out Hwak Se.

90
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,880
I see.

91
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,670
You're working hard.

92
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,740
Uncle, no one's home, right?

93
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,400
Yeah. I'm sure everyone is out.

94
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,910
Good day.

95
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,990
Go on.

96
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,020
Why is she asking if
 the house is empty?

97
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,990
I guess they need to 
have a serious talk.

98
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,820
Eems hyung, you can 
be quite sharp at times.

99
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,120
You're quick-witted, too.

100
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,080
I know, right?

101
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,290
I feel that myself.

102
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,210
You feel like you're 
quick-witted and sharp?

103
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,560
Yes.

104
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,150
Yeah, right. Aunt.

105
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,870
So, Unni and Bit Chae 
came home together?

106
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,140
Unni said she's working at 
Yeonhuidong house today.

107
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,670
How about Bit Chae's work?

108
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,230
That's what I'm saying.

109
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,920
The mood was quite unusual. 
It's something serious.

110
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,020
Noonim doesn't look so good, either.

111
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,250
I'm worried to death about them.

112
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,370
They asked if the house is empty.

113
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,520
Yeah, right. They also 
asked if no one is home.

114
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,580
I wonder if they're going
 to fight big time.

115
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,040
All right.

116
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,870
You're glad I called, huh?

117
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,610
Isn't that obvious?

118
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,550
We're both Samgwang residents.

119
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,680
I got to go. I'm busy.

120
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,500
Hello? Hel...

121
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,480
Gosh, what in the world?

122
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,720
Unlike her name, 
she's so cut and dry.

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,700
Only her name means
 "full of affection."

124
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,950
She has a nice name.

125
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,900
But Hyungnim, I was right to 
call her being worried, right?

126
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,420
Right...

127
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,190
My goodness.

128
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,910
Put this away. I'm fine.

129
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,480
Mom...

130
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,400
You worked so hard to get in. 
Why quit your job?

131
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,450
Why are you trying to
 ruin your future?

132
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,760
You worked so hard to raise me.

133
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,620
Why are you trying so 
hard to send me away?

134
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,620
That's why I couldn't send you off.

135
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,180
Even though I watched you suffer,

136
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,900
I was so mean all 
this time. So bad.

137
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,750
Mom.

138
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,900
I don't need a birth mom.

139
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,200
Even if she's truly my birth mom,

140
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,860
I'm sure she abandoned me.

141
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,530
Because she didn't 
need me in her life.

142
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,960
- I said that's not it.
- I know.

143
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,710
You're afraid I'd hate my birth mom, 
so you're shielding me.

144
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,080
That's why you're suffering alone.

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,590
Let's just forget about all this.

146
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,550
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

147
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,590
I'll pretend I never knew her.

148
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,810
I'll quit my job.

149
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,230
I'll look for another job.

150
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,680
Chae Woon, what's with you?

151
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,980
Why?

152
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,510
How can you ignore the person
 who gave birth to you?

153
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,390
I thought I was supposedly dead.

154
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,000
I thought I'm not supposed 
to be in this world.

155
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,450
I guess you knew.

156
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,480
That's why you couldn't 
send me back.

157
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,380
Since I'm supposed to be dead.

158
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,550
Chae Woon.

159
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,590
Who told you that?

160
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,410
Who said that? Who told you that?

161
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,070
 It's Seo Yeon. 

162
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,880
 My daughter who left 
me a long time ago. 

163
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,050
Someone who has 
nothing to do with me.

164
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,090
I'll get some rest.

165
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,370
Chae Woon.

166
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,120
I just...

167
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,550
couldn't tell you that.

168
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,330
There's a reason.

169
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,420
We can resolve all that.

170
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,430
I told everything to CEO. So...

171
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,990
You know...

172
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,340
Who brought me to you...

173
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,270
why I'm supposedly dead, or why...

174
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,160
I wasn't welcome. 
I had so many questions.

175
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,520
But I decided not to dig in.

176
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,360
It's not worth finding out now.

177
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,010
And nothing changes 
even if I find out.

178
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,920
I have...

179
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,560
a right not to look for parents 
who abandoned me.

180
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,040
I was abandoned, but you 
took me in and poured love

181
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
and raised me. 
You're my real mom.

182
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,390
Get some rest.

183
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,270
No...

184
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,520
No. Hey, Chae Woon.

185
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,910
Chae Woon!

186
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,460
Chae Woon.

187
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
Chae Woon.

188
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,020
Chae Woon.

189
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,600
Mom, are you awake?

190
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,390
 What are you doing? 

191
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,620
 Mom, are you okay? 

192
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,750
Mom...

193
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,830
 Park Pil Hong... 

194
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,850
 At first, Seo Yeon's father... 

195
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,990
 brought Seo Yeon to me and 

196
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,690
 asked me to take care of
 her for a few days. 

197
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,580
 Could that be true? 

198
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,050
 No... 

199
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,850
 That couldn't be. 

200
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,080
 There's no way. 

201
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Mom, are you okay?

202
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,200
Stay lying down.

203
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,460
I'm okay.

204
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,260
Seo Ah.

205
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,800
Go back to work.

206
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,350
No. I'll stay here.

207
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,220
Go back.

208
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,890
You have two important 
meetings today. Hurry.

209
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,920
 Bit Chae Woon told her 
she's her birth daughter. 

210
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,610
Hello.

211
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,780
I called you earlier. 
I'm Lee Ra Hoon.

212
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,690
Hi, you're early.

213
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,300
Yes, thank you in advance.

214
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,450
Okay, take care of that first.

215
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,850
Yes, I got it.

216
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,190
 I know I'm pretty. 

217
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,260
- Enjoy. 
- Well...

218
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,530
can I have your number?

219
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,320
Oh, no. I don't have a phone.

220
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,090
I prefer to live simply.

221
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,850
Stop by for more sandwiches.

222
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,340
Okay.

223
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,400
Aigoo.

224
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,440
- I'll place my order.
- Okay, sir.

225
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,420
One meatball sandwich, please.

226
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,850
Please leave out all 
vegetables and...

227
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,030
just put bell peppers and onions.

228
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,310
Oh, okay.

229
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,930
- You mean a meatball sandwich, right?
- Gosh.

230
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,830
Meatball.

231
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,530
Meatball.

232
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,920
All right.

233
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,540
Wait a moment. 
I'll get something else.

234
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,550
You have steak and cheese?

235
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,220
Could you change to that one?

236
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,850
Steak and cheese?

237
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,690
Yes, I got it.

238
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,320
Cheese and...

239
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,150
 
 Oppa, you're not up yet, huh? 

240
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,930
 It must be early morning in London. 

241
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,530
 Oppa, Mom is... 

242
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,060
It's no use telling him.

243
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,050
He doesn't care about 
things at home.

244
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,480
Geez, Seo Ah, she's 
making me feel guilty.

245
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,150
Geez, it stings. She's poking.

246
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,760
Geez.

247
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Steak and cheese.

248
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,500
Steak and cheese.

249
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,120
Enjoy.

250
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,470
 - Thank you. 
- Sure.

251
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,930
Wow, you're good. 
Have you done this before?

252
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,210
Yes, I learned here and there. I've had 
many part-time jobs, too.

253
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,620
- I see.
- I also...

254
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,720
want to run a food truck 
like this someday.

255
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,160
Really? You'll have to make
 lots of money then.

256
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,920
This looks pretty small, but...

257
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,620
it's quite a business.

258
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,880
Of course.

259
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,590
Please teach me well.

260
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,030
All right.

261
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,040
 The new place. 

262
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,100
- Their drinking food is good.
- We should go.

263
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,160
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, their food is...

264
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,960
is really cheap.

265
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,980
Hey, let's go.

266
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,850
Here. There's a hair
 salon over there.

267
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,520
Deliver this over there.

268
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,440
 Cha Ba Reun, I thought she's 
taking a break from school. 

269
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,980
You changed your part-time job.

270
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,650
You didn't even tell me.

271
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,330
I'm doing this at the same time.

272
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,380
So what?

273
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,020
Why should I tell you?

274
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,220
I'm working part-time at the 
school administrative office.

275
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
You don't need to report that to me.

276
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,510
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon.

277
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,550
What's with you?

278
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,150
Are you upset about something?

279
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,760
No.

280
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,940
Just go back to your friends.

281
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,170
- Ba Reun.
- Ba Reun, what were you doing?

282
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,990
- Are you finished?
 - I know it, too. 

283
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,170
 It's my inferior complex. 

284
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,180
Want to go now?

285
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,860
- That place?
- Yeah, let's go there now.

286
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,960
You don't have money, though.

287
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,690
- I got paid.
- You did?

288
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,460
Yeah, right. It's on me.

289
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,990
I got paid.

290
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,500
 - CEO!
- Young Lady! 

291
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,220
 - CEO!
- Young Lady! 

292
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,230
 

293
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,380
 

294
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,730
 Good job. You answered 
the phone right away. 

295
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,560
I can't believe you stayed out for
 two nights. Where are you?

296
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,770
Home? You're not at work?

297
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,320
Are you sick?

298
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,820
No. Just playing hooky.

299
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,260
 Bit Chae Woon. 

300
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,080
 Shall we play hooky? 

301
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,870
 You're going to stay home, right? 

302
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,370
Okay. Just wait.

303
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,100
Is it Ms. Bit Chae Woon?

304
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,010
Yeah.

305
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,950
Are you dating her by chance?

306
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,280
Almost right before that stage.

307
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,860
Look at this guy. 
What about Seo Ah?

308
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,080
She's just my friend's younger 
sister. My friend's sister.

309
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,140
 

310
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,460
I'm pretty sure it was Jung Hoo.

311
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,140
 

312
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,590
Hey, why don't you 
answer the phone?

313
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,230
Okay.

314
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,030
It's not my phone.

315
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,250
 

316
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,090
- Mom...
- What?

317
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,080
You have two phones?

318
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,040
 Jung Hoo. 

319
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,610
 Is everything okay? 

320
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,700
 Please reply. 

321
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,700
Everything is fine, Mom...

322
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,640
That's not it.

323
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,450
Nothing wrong.

324
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,500
"Nothing wrong"?

325
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,480
He doesn't talk like that.

326
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,390
 Let's talk on the phone. 

327
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,840
Meeting with executives.

328
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,090
 Call me after. 

329
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,460
 I'm sure the meeting will 
end at some point. 

330
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,940
What do I do?

331
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,390
Don't want to.

332
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,710
That's not right.

333
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,580
Geez!

334
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,630
 Don't want to? 

335
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,930
I was worried sick about him...

336
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,650
 If you don't call back, I'll stop 
by your office or the house. 

337
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,080
Geez!

338
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,120
Gosh, what should I do?

339
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,660
What do I do?

340
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,000
So, Yoo Jae Hee...

341
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,190
No.

342
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,470
You want me to pretend
 to be your father?

343
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,890
That's it, right?

344
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
Yes.

345
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,210
Your voice is very 
similar to my father's.

346
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:45,920
My mom is extremely worried 
since my father hasn't called her.

347
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,790
Wow.

348
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,230
Your father is so heartless.

349
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,750
Even if they got divorced,

350
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,500
why isn't he calling her?
 She must be worried.

351
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,840
So, what did I say 
you should sound?

352
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,380
Well, sound stubborn.

353
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,720
With a shrill voice.

354
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,320
Oh, never... 
don't be kind and polite.

355
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,700
Okay.

356
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,230
All right then. I'm calling.

357
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,300
Wait a minute.

358
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
Why?

359
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,510
I'm nervous.

360
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,140
I'm calling.

361
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,520
Here.

362
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,020
 

363
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,570
It's about time.

364
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,710
Here.

365
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,520
 Hello? 

366
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,060
Hel...

367
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,720
 

368
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,970
Why?

369
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,470
 

370
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,580
Aggressive.

371
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,110
Why?

372
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,730
Of course.

373
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,780
Are you doing okay?

374
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,740
 Are you feeling sick? 

375
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,900
Wait, wait, wait.

376
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,180
 

377
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm okay...

378
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,980
Of course, I'm okay!

379
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,090
You're sick, huh?

380
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,620
 Are you also suffering 
from depression? 

381
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,680
  
I'm perfectly fine.

382
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,070
Bye, I'm busy.

383
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,780
Whoa...

384
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,190
Hello, Woo Jung Hoo? Woo...

385
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,780
My gosh.

386
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,820
Gosh, I was a fool for 
worrying about him.

387
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,190
How is Jung Hoo?

388
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,600
The same.

389
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,270
Why are you asking me
 how Jung Hoo is doing?

390
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,320
Yeah, well. Just because.

391
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,360
You know I always avoid him.

392
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,370
So do a good job at work!

393
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,920
Geez.

394
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,600
I...

395
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,370
I did a good job, huh?

396
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,620
Yes.

397
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,960
 Chae Woon... 

398
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,590
 is Seo Yeon. 

399
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,210
What if...

400
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,180
it's true?

401
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,260
No.

402
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,060
It can't be.

403
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,770
It can't be.

404
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,680
My phone...

405
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,230
 Mom, I'll keep your 
phone for the day. 

406
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,510
 I don't want you to worry 
about anything. 

407
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,620
 I'll come by after work. 

408
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Hello.

409
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,450
I'm an employee at LX Fashion.

410
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,790
Director Jang Seo Ah 
asked me to drop by.

411
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,100
Is that you, Seo Ah?

412
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,290
Hello, I'm Hwang Na Ro.

413
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,180
Oh, you're on our Spain project.

414
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,400
Yes.

415
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,200
How are you feeling?

416
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm fine.

417
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,480
Did Seo Ah send you?

418
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,200
I spoke to Bit Chae Woon, and 
she was very worried about you.

419
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,080
I know I'm out of line, 
but I just came by.

420
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,410
Is Bit Chae Woon doing okay?

421
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,850
Yes.

422
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,590
You must be close to 
Bit Chae Woon.

423
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,900
Since we live in the same 
house, we're friendly.

424
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,530
In the same house?

425
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,950
Yes.

426
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,280
I got adopted by a Dutch family
 when I was young.

427
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,710
Since we share many similarities,

428
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,790
we open up our feelings as friends.

429
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,400
Yes, we're like that.

430
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,500
Hwang Na Ro.

431
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,880
Could you help me out?

432
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,090
Yes, please tell me anything.

433
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,700
You should just rest.

434
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm sure the deliveries 
must be backed up.

435
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,820
I'll be careful at work.

436
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,330
Okay?

437
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,000
Please?

438
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,660
Then call me right away if 
anything comes up.

439
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,790
Okay.

440
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,250
 He smiles so much. 

441
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,790
 I've never seen Father
 smiling before. 

442
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,570
Are you going to work again?

443
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,300
I'll stop by downstairs.

444
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,100
You go ahead.

445
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,370
To see the oldest daughter? 
You're worried.

446
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,660
How do you know that...

447
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,470
Gosh...

448
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,210
I know everything.

449
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,450
You know what they say.

450
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,340
"You can't hide poverty and love."

451
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,390
You remember stuff like that,

452
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,760
yet you don't remember
 anything about yourself?

453
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,380
I know, huh?

454
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,750
Fighting.

455
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,550
 Bit Chae Woon, I'm in the living room. 
Can you come out for a minute? 

456
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,250
 I'm sorry. I'll just rest. 

457
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,550
Excuse me!

458
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,410
Wait! Wait a minute!

459
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,590
Wait!

460
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,580
What, what, what?

461
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,130
What?

462
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,500
What's wrong, Eems hyung?

463
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,850
Huh?

464
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Geez, what's going on?

465
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,590
Your fear of creditors again?

466
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,210
Why, why, why?

467
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,800
Father!

468
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,740
It was Father for sure.

469
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,650
Oh, my!

470
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,190
Gosh.

471
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,020
What's with you?

472
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,680
"What's with you?"

473
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,820
 Whoa, she looks so rich. 

474
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,630
 Are they real name brands? 

475
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,050
Wow, what a rude girl.

476
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:10,090
I can't believe how she can show 
at once what a rude person she is.

477
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,520
- Let's go. Don't want to deal with a mess.
- What does she do?

478
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,920
I don't know what she 
does. Let's go.

479
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,190
Wow.

480
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,940
- Uncle.
- Hae Deun, Aunt.

481
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,240
You're home early.

482
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,000
Are you worried about Noonim?

483
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,160
Well, kind of sort of.

484
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,180
What are my sister and
 Bit Chae up to?

485
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,800
Well, you know. Eems hyung, 
she's gone. Come out. Come.

486
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,750
Geez.

487
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,850
Aunt.

488
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,040
- Hae Deun.
- Hello.

489
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,420
James, you're working so hard.

490
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,480
Yes.

491
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,330
Ms. Lee and her 
daughter are both...

492
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,850
Oh, really?

493
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,090
I guess something did 
happen to both of them.

494
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,110
They have escaped to 
the world of sleep.

495
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,520
When I see that, 
those two are so similar.

496
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,800
Sleeping is medicine.

497
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,230
Yes, of course.

498
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,570
I'll sit down for a moment.

499
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,670
If I go home early, the spark 
can fly in my direction.

500
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,460
Geez.

501
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,230
- Why, Hae Deun? Why?
- Why?

502
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,340
The clothes that rude 
girl was wearing...

503
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,780
It's over 10 million won in total.

504
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,480
It would've been nice if our Hae Deun 
would've studied so hard like that.

505
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,130
I wonder what kind of 
person she is.

506
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,870
What else? She got lucky 
with rich parents.

507
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,960
Well, are you hungry?

508
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,780
Should I bring you something?

509
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,670
Sure, go ahead.

510
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,250
Aigoo...

511
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,820
You look worse.

512
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,740
You want to get some fresh air?

513
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,170
Aren't you going to work?

514
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,740
I'm playing hooky.

515
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,190
Let's go.

516
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,260
How about a jacket?

517
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,740
Oh, I'll bring out that 
jacket from last time.

518
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,500
Wear that.

519
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,410
Oppa.

520
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,373
Seo... Seo... Seo Ah.

521
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:39,043
Are you here to see me?

522
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:40,383
No.

523
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:44,813
To see the ahjumma of this house.

524
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:46,842
Why?

525
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:48,882
Oppa.

526
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:50,772
What do I do about my mom?

527
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,442
 What's going on with your mother? 

528
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,702
 It was chaotic earlier. 

529
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:57,312
 What's going on? 

530
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:03,702
Bit Chae Woon.

531
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:05,192
Jang Seo Ah.

532
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:07,172
What brings you here?

533
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:13,242
I wanted to talk to your mother.

534
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:16,332
I'm baffled.

535
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:20,352
Wait, Seo Ah, what's this about?

536
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,382
Let's talk together, Oppa.

537
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,032
It involves my family.

538
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,782
It's not about your family.

539
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:28,022
It involves the CEO and my family.

540
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,132
"Your family"?

541
00:36:30,132 --> 00:36:32,832
Hey, talk to me about it.

542
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:34,412
I'm my mom's daughter!

543
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:37,172
Hey, Seo Ah, what's with you?

544
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:38,562
Seo Ah...

545
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:41,502
How is your mother?

546
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:43,452
What do you think?

547
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,092
Do you even know
 what you've done?

548
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:47,392
Jang Seo Ah!

549
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:52,202
Hey, Seo Ah, why are 
you being so rude?

550
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:54,442
Mr. Woo, it's okay.

551
00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:57,052
Seo Ah.

552
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:59,012
Let's sit down and talk.

553
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:00,632
Seo Ah.

554
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:03,122
Mom.

555
00:37:03,122 --> 00:37:04,952
Young Lady.

556
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,542
Mom, why are you here?

557
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,822
You shouldn't move 
around like this.

558
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:13,592
Where is Ms. Goo?

559
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:15,132
I came here alone.

560
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,942
You should've discussed it with 
me first. What are you doing?

561
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:20,752
I wanted to find out the details.

562
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:25,412
I thought these weird people
 were bothering you.

563
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,902
It's nothing like that.

564
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:30,062
Jae Hee, you're here, too.

565
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,202
Yes, Mother. What's going on?

566
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:34,442
Jae Hee.

567
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:36,872
- Take Seo Ah.
- Okay.

568
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:40,152
Mom, I'll stay here, too.

569
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:03,922
What's this about?

570
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:06,222
And even if something major is up,

571
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:07,672
how can you behave 
like that to an elder?

572
00:38:07,672 --> 00:38:08,872
Oppa.

573
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,372
My mom fainted earlier.

574
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,422
What?

575
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:13,712
Why?

576
00:38:13,712 --> 00:38:17,842
Because Bit Chae Woon's mom met 
my mom and said something strange.

577
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,212
Something strange what?

578
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:22,492
She says Bit Chae Woon is...

579
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:24,632
my mom's daughter!

580
00:38:24,632 --> 00:38:26,332
Does this make sense?

581
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:28,672
What?

582
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:31,072
No matter how tough
 it is to make a living,

583
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:33,862
how can she lie like that?

584
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,302
Seo Ah.

585
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:49,262
Bit Chae Woon's mom 
doesn't lie like that.

586
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:52,242
There must be a reason 
she couldn't talk about...

587
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,462
Oppa!

588
00:38:54,342 --> 00:38:57,742
How can you not believe me 
but believe that weird person?

589
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:00,142
She's not weird.

590
00:39:00,142 --> 00:39:03,142
Don't talk about Bit Chae Woon's
 mom like that.

591
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:04,582
Oppa.

592
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:21,932
Chae Woon, later.

593
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:23,022
Okay.

594
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,682
Bring some tea.

595
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:28,332
It's okay.

596
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:45,642
Unni.

597
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:48,542
Look at you.

598
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:52,622
Hey.

599
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,822
Something's up, huh?

600
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:57,722
I heard your CEO is here.

601
00:39:57,722 --> 00:39:59,242
What's going on?

602
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:03,992
Auntie.

603
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:06,312
Let's leave them alone to talk.

604
00:40:08,932 --> 00:40:10,302
Unni.

605
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:12,532
So tell us.

606
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:16,762
Wait, Aunt.

607
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:18,662
Let's listen to Chae Woon.

608
00:40:19,902 --> 00:40:21,122
Shall we?

609
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:22,822
Yes.

610
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:25,692
I wonder what it is.

611
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:32,002
How do you feel?

612
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:37,622
I'm fine.

613
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:42,952
I'm sorry...

614
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:46,122
for shocking you.

615
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:49,782
Are you sure...

616
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,172
you didn't do it?

617
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:54,862
You didn't plot together 
with Park Pil Hong?

618
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,712
No, I didn't.

619
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:04,442
Then why did you cut off contact
 after taking my daughter?

620
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:08,312
Why do you come to me now 
and turn me upside down?

621
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:11,132
You said you didn't plot it 
with Park Pil Hong.

622
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,432
Why?

623
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:14,732
Why?

624
00:41:19,802 --> 00:41:21,722
My mom...

625
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:24,662
even confirmed...

626
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:28,982
my Seo Yeon's body.

627
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:33,432
She even registered her death.

628
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:37,682
How can you raise that child?

629
00:41:37,682 --> 00:41:39,592
How is it that Bit Chae Woon is...

630
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:41,672
my daughter?

631
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:49,782
 Unni is CEO's birth daughter? 

632
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:54,902
Tell me.

633
00:42:00,362 --> 00:42:01,932
Soon Jung.

634
00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:05,662
You can never tell anyone about this.

635
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:07,202
This is the only way...

636
00:42:07,202 --> 00:42:11,332
I can rescue my Jung Won from 
that bastard Park Pil Hong.

637
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:14,642
Chairwoman, I can't do that.

638
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:17,712
How can I deceive 
Young Lady Jung Won?

639
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:20,182
Raise Seo Yeon for just a few years.

640
00:42:20,182 --> 00:42:22,942
After Jung Won recovers from 
her illness in the States,

641
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:26,362
I'll take Seo Yeon then. 
Only until then.

642
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,092
I'm not all that healthy, either...

643
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,232
and my Jung Won is in that state.

644
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:35,422
My family is about to go down.

645
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:37,802
Please help me, Soon Jung.

646
00:42:37,802 --> 00:42:40,332
I'll beg on my knees.

647
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:41,932
- Please?
- Oh, no...

648
00:42:41,932 --> 00:42:43,402
- Soon Jung.
- Don't do this.

649
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:46,242
Soon Jung, please 
save my Jung Won.

650
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:49,032
My Jung Won's life is in your hands.

651
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:50,932
- Chairwoman...
- Please...

652
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:52,792
Please save my Jung Won.

653
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,072
What do I do?

654
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,692
Please don't do this.

655
00:43:07,142 --> 00:43:08,542
Huh?

656
00:43:12,462 --> 00:43:14,032
As for that...

657
00:43:15,352 --> 00:43:17,542
I can't tell you.

658
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:22,702
As expected,

659
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:25,562
you can't tell me, Soon Jung.

660
00:43:33,302 --> 00:43:35,292
I looked into it...

661
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:38,402
and it seems you have to
 move out of this villa.

662
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:40,712
You don't have a place 
to move into, either.

663
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:45,572
I will help you with anything.

664
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:49,622
Regardless of Bit Chae Woon's intern
 evaluation, I'll send her overseas to study.

665
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:51,912
She's my friend's daughter. 
I can do that much for her.

666
00:43:51,912 --> 00:43:55,342
When she returns, I'll give her 
a great position in my design team.

667
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,342
I'll take care of her to the end.

668
00:43:57,342 --> 00:43:59,762
Young Lady, don't do this.

669
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,642
I deserve this, but...

670
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:04,052
don't treat Chae Woon this way.

671
00:44:04,052 --> 00:44:06,302
I said I'd take care of everything!

672
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:10,162
I'll let you live in a much
 better house than this.

673
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:12,572
But this is wrong.

674
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:15,202
To deceive an old friend

675
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,462
and trying to get something 
out of it. This is wrong!

676
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:18,882
Unni.

677
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:20,982
Jung Won unni.

678
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:24,702
This is wrong of you, Jung Won unni.

679
00:44:24,702 --> 00:44:26,862
How can you...

680
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:28,782
Man Jung.

681
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:30,582
Stay out. Hwak Se, take her.

682
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:31,442
Okay.

683
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:34,742
Don't you know what kind of 
person Soon Jung unni is?

684
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:37,702
How can you ramble on 
with a mouth of yours?

685
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:39,432
Man Jung, get out.

686
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:41,022
- Hurry up and leave.
- Let's go.

687
00:44:41,022 --> 00:44:42,602
Unni!

688
00:44:50,282 --> 00:44:51,852
CEO.

689
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:54,332
My mom isn't like that.

690
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,322
Chae Woon.

691
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:57,882
It's okay, Mom.

692
00:44:59,052 --> 00:45:02,372
If you don't want to believe her,
 you don't have to.

693
00:45:02,372 --> 00:45:04,082
But...

694
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:07,492
my mom isn't the type to 
deceive people over money.

695
00:45:08,712 --> 00:45:11,292
My mom is so naive.

696
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,762
Wasn't she famous for 
that back then?

697
00:45:13,762 --> 00:45:15,942
Naive and foolish Lee Soon Jung.

698
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:19,082
My mom still...

699
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:22,142
is so frustratingly foolish and naive.

700
00:45:22,142 --> 00:45:23,832
Chae Woon, get out.

701
00:45:23,832 --> 00:45:27,492
Elders are talking. 
What are you doing? Get out.

702
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:28,802
Get out.

703
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:35,132
It's so draining.

704
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:40,592
 Unni is CEO's daughter... 

705
00:45:44,282 --> 00:45:45,932
I'm home.

706
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,332
Why is everyone here?

707
00:45:50,142 --> 00:45:54,522
Is Chae Woon really 
Jung Won noonim's daughter?

708
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:01,902
I guess so.

709
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:04,712
My unni doesn't lie 
about stuff like that.

710
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:07,472
Chae Woon noona?

711
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:12,322
What's this all about?

712
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:19,442
Since you insist that you're 
innocent, I have no choice.

713
00:46:20,482 --> 00:46:23,102
Let's run a DNA test.

714
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:26,932
I was afraid strange 
rumors would spread,

715
00:46:26,932 --> 00:46:29,432
so I wanted to avoid running a test.

716
00:46:29,432 --> 00:46:31,382
But I have no choice.

717
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:33,872
Yes.

718
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:36,982
I think we should do that.

719
00:46:39,242 --> 00:46:41,402
This is the limit to my compassion.

720
00:46:42,452 --> 00:46:45,172
The moment the test 
comes out negative,

721
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:48,712
our relationship is over.

722
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:52,032
Bit Chae Woon...

723
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:54,622
you should quit working...

724
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:57,642
I submitted my resignation.

725
00:47:01,312 --> 00:47:02,712
No.

726
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:05,122
She's behaving this way 
because she's immature.

727
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,562
She will continue to work there.

728
00:47:07,562 --> 00:47:09,332
No, I won't.

729
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:14,332
Even if I never make it into 
a great company like that again,

730
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,092
even if I'll work 
part-time gigs forever,

731
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,652
I won't work at your company.

732
00:47:22,952 --> 00:47:26,732
And I will not go through 
with the DNA test.

733
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:29,162
Chae Woon.

734
00:47:30,922 --> 00:47:33,712
As you firmly believe,

735
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:36,812
I'm sure the test will 
come out negative.

736
00:47:37,662 --> 00:47:39,342
Just in case...

737
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:42,442
there can't be strange 
rumors about you.

738
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,922
Chae Woon.

739
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:46,462
Why are you distorting things?

740
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:48,612
Why are you being so mean to her?

741
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,692
Bit Chae Woon, were you...

742
00:47:52,712 --> 00:47:55,092
always so rude?

743
00:47:56,092 --> 00:47:57,242
Yes.

744
00:47:58,082 --> 00:48:00,382
I was brought up in 
a rough environment.

745
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:05,092
That's why I'd plot with 
my mom and plan a scam.

746
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:06,542
Bit Chae Woon!

747
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:11,332
Rather than being 
humiliated after lying,

748
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:13,382
I'll just give up now.

749
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:18,572
Goodbye.

750
00:48:18,572 --> 00:48:19,552
Chae Woon.

751
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:22,472
What... what are you
 doing right now?

752
00:48:22,472 --> 00:48:24,712
You'll regret this big time later.

753
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:27,532
Hurry up and apologize
 to CEO. Hurry.

754
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:32,502
Chae Woon.

755
00:48:38,052 --> 00:48:39,752
Soon Jung.

756
00:48:42,492 --> 00:48:44,582
Let's take the test.

757
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:06,772
I brought the CEO over. 
She asked me to.

758
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:12,862
From the hospital?

759
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:14,272
Yes.

760
00:49:14,272 --> 00:49:17,962
I needed her approval on the Spain 
project, so I went to the hospital.

761
00:49:27,202 --> 00:49:28,542
Why?

762
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:32,202
How should I put this...

763
00:49:34,802 --> 00:49:38,672
I feel like you keep 
circling around me.

764
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:43,372
I told you.

765
00:49:43,372 --> 00:49:46,102
It's because I like you.

766
00:50:23,782 --> 00:50:28,222
Although we still have 
to run the DNA test,

767
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,402
Chae Woon...

768
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:35,692
is Kim Jung Won's birth daughter.

769
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:39,872
Chae Woon noona...

770
00:50:39,872 --> 00:50:42,892
gets to live in her house now?

771
00:50:44,452 --> 00:50:46,152
I'm not sure.

772
00:50:46,822 --> 00:50:49,332
Not right away, but...

773
00:50:49,332 --> 00:50:50,722
Mom.

774
00:50:56,072 --> 00:50:58,402
Don't let Chae Woon 
know you know.

775
00:50:59,712 --> 00:51:03,542
She's in shock right now.

776
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:05,652
And she's having a hard time.

777
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:09,022
All right, I won't say anything.

778
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:12,222
Gosh, what is all this?

779
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:14,472
Unni must've been in shock.

780
00:51:15,562 --> 00:51:16,992
Then...

781
00:51:17,732 --> 00:51:21,052
someone brought
 Chae Woon noona to you?

782
00:51:22,722 --> 00:51:26,332
Let's talk about details later.

783
00:51:26,332 --> 00:51:27,452
Okay?

784
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,442
Okay.

785
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,662
Unni, you're something.

786
00:51:36,862 --> 00:51:38,172
Unni...

787
00:51:39,132 --> 00:51:42,492
you get scared so easily. How...

788
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:46,742
did you live all this time hiding 
such a huge secret?

789
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:49,782
Huh?

790
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:56,612
Is that why you slept like a dead 
person whenever you had a chance?

791
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,272
To quiet noisy thoughts 
in your head?

792
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:09,002
You're something, Unni.

793
00:52:30,752 --> 00:52:33,632
- Unni...
- Noona.

794
00:52:33,632 --> 00:52:35,272
What?

795
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:45,042
You guys heard, huh?

796
00:52:49,892 --> 00:52:52,292
That's not true.

797
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:54,152
Really?

798
00:52:56,732 --> 00:52:58,872
Even if it's true,

799
00:52:58,872 --> 00:53:01,332
nothing will change. Really.

800
00:53:03,192 --> 00:53:06,082
But if that's true...

801
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:11,202
shouldn't you move to that 
house and live there?

802
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:13,962
It's not true. 
Why would I live there?

803
00:53:14,672 --> 00:53:16,732
And even if it's true,

804
00:53:16,732 --> 00:53:19,032
I'll never move to that house.

805
00:53:22,762 --> 00:53:25,302
Gosh. Come here.

806
00:53:29,032 --> 00:53:30,392
Aigoo.

807
00:53:32,982 --> 00:53:36,292
Gosh, why are you guys being
 cautious all of a sudden?

808
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:37,392
Hey.

809
00:53:37,392 --> 00:53:38,712
Hey.

810
00:53:38,712 --> 00:53:40,172
Come on.

811
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:44,852
Gosh.

812
00:53:46,352 --> 00:53:47,672
Hey.

813
00:54:07,112 --> 00:54:09,532
 

814
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,492
You finally call me.

815
00:54:25,982 --> 00:54:28,122
I saw your text.

816
00:54:28,122 --> 00:54:29,532
What?

817
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:33,212
You told Jung Won that 
Seo Yeon is alive?

818
00:54:33,212 --> 00:54:35,592
Are you out of your mind?

819
00:54:35,592 --> 00:54:37,652
Don't worry.

820
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:40,002
I didn't tell her about you.

821
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:43,552
You left Chae Woon...

822
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:46,262
with me...

823
00:54:47,092 --> 00:54:50,632
and you turned things 
as if she was dead.

824
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:52,492
And...

825
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:56,162
you pleaded with me 
to raise Chae Woon.

826
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:58,602
 But you cut off contact 
and left for the States. 

827
00:54:58,602 --> 00:55:00,802
 Don't you remember everything? 

828
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:02,452
How...

829
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:05,962
How can you do that to 
Chae Woon and me?

830
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:10,062
I didn't tell Young Lady Jung Won.

831
00:55:12,162 --> 00:55:15,762
Not for you, Madam, 
but for my Chae Woon.

832
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:18,002
If she finds out that 
her grandma and father

833
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:21,152
 abandoned her, my Chae Woon... 

834
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:24,312
will get hurt so much, 
and it will destroy her.

835
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:27,172
You revealed everything already,

836
00:55:27,172 --> 00:55:29,632
and you think that 
secret will stay hidden?

837
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:33,032
I will take all the blame.

838
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:37,862
If it's for Chae Woon, 
I can take all the blame.

839
00:55:37,862 --> 00:55:40,062
So, Madam...

840
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:45,902
so that Chae Woon can't 
find out such horrific truth,

841
00:55:45,902 --> 00:55:47,682
please be careful.

842
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:51,472
If you feel bad

843
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:54,702
toward Chae Woon even a little bit,

844
00:55:54,702 --> 00:55:58,932
I will trust that...

845
00:55:58,932 --> 00:56:00,792
you'll keep that promise.

846
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:26,952
 

847
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:42,342
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

848
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:44,382
- Did you sleep well, Mom?
- Yeah.

849
00:56:44,382 --> 00:56:46,062
How can I help you?

850
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:49,732
It's okay. Go back to 
bed and sleep more.

851
00:56:49,732 --> 00:56:52,712
Nah, I've been a slacker 
all this time.

852
00:56:52,712 --> 00:56:55,162
Now that I'm unemployed, 
I should help out.

853
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,842
Gosh.

854
00:56:58,192 --> 00:56:59,532
Should I wash these?

855
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:00,742
Yeah, sure.

856
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,562
- Over there.
- Okay.

857
00:57:15,692 --> 00:57:17,052
- Chae Woon.
- Yeah?

858
00:57:17,052 --> 00:57:19,482
- Good morning, Uncle.
- Good morning.

859
00:57:19,482 --> 00:57:21,232
Are you prepping breakfast?

860
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:23,342
Yeah, it's been a while.

861
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:28,192
Aigoo, Noonim. Why are you 
taking such a risk?

862
00:57:28,192 --> 00:57:31,352
Whoa, Unni. What's up with you?

863
00:57:31,352 --> 00:57:33,982
We can forget about our 
breakfast this morning.

864
00:57:33,982 --> 00:57:36,852
I guess Bit Chae Woon 
prepared breakfast?

865
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:39,522
Whoa, it's fancy.

866
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,472
- Does it look good?
- Looks pretty good.

867
00:57:41,472 --> 00:57:42,642
All right.

868
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:45,832
Everyone at Samgwang Villa, 
have a seat.

869
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:48,122
Eems hyung, have a seat.

870
00:57:48,122 --> 00:57:49,302
- Okay.
- All right.

871
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:50,572
 Cheers! 

872
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:52,562
 - What are we doing?
- Yay! 

873
00:57:52,562 --> 00:57:53,972
Clang your glass.

874
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:55,162
Clang!

875
00:57:57,452 --> 00:57:59,082
- Isn't it delicious?
- It's salty.

876
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:00,252
- Chae Woon.
- Yes?

877
00:58:00,252 --> 00:58:02,412
The food has been upgraded.

878
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,112
- Whoa.
- Let me try it.

879
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:05,592
It's delicious.

880
00:58:05,592 --> 00:58:07,162
Seriously.

881
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:09,402
- It's so tasty.
- Right?

882
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,222
- I made it.
- It's really good.

883
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:13,152
- It's good.
- Your cooking improved.

884
00:58:13,152 --> 00:58:14,992
Hey, isn't it good?

885
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,032
I think this turned out well.

886
00:58:17,032 --> 00:58:18,412
Hey.

887
00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:25,172
Koala.

888
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,492
You didn't bring your car home?

889
00:58:27,492 --> 00:58:29,822
I drank with Mr. Yoo last night.

890
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:32,922
You get to exercise in the morning 
since you're not working. How nice.

891
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:35,082
Right? I get to walk you
 out, too, Koala.

892
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:37,512
Really? Why today?

893
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:39,472
To celebrate great weather.

894
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,292
That's nice.

895
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,632
Then to celebrate that...

896
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:46,592
What are you doing?

897
00:58:47,502 --> 00:58:49,742
Trying to enjoy this 
moment thoroughly.

898
00:58:49,742 --> 00:58:51,292
Come on now.

899
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:53,292
You'll be late. Just walk 
the way you walk.

900
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:54,702
I don't want to.

901
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:55,812
Come on.

902
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:57,492
So...

903
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,592
you won't continue to 
take time off, right?

904
00:58:59,592 --> 00:59:01,222
I will.

905
00:59:01,222 --> 00:59:02,542
Give me a break.

906
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,422
Come out to our construction 
site starting tomorrow.

907
00:59:04,422 --> 00:59:06,142
I'll let you join us.

908
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,692
It's okay.

909
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:09,982
This chance doesn't 
come by that often.

910
00:59:09,982 --> 00:59:12,242
Fine. I'll pay you well. 
Come out.

911
00:59:12,242 --> 00:59:13,152
Okay?

912
00:59:13,932 --> 00:59:15,882
Gosh, come on. Come.

913
00:59:15,882 --> 00:59:17,452
It's okay.

914
00:59:17,452 --> 00:59:18,602
Hurry up and go.

915
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:21,902
You'll be late, and the men on site 
will get mad. Hurry up and go.

916
00:59:21,902 --> 00:59:23,602
- I'm heavy.
- Hey.

917
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,262
What are you two doing?

918
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,622
What? Walking out Koala?

919
00:59:27,622 --> 00:59:28,842
That's it.

920
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:31,052
Geez, walk me out, too.

921
00:59:31,052 --> 00:59:32,192
Cunning Penguin.

922
00:59:32,192 --> 00:59:34,962
There are that road and that street. 
Why do you always walk this way?

923
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:36,392
It's up to me.

924
00:59:36,392 --> 00:59:37,542
Me, too.

925
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:38,532
All right.

926
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:39,982
Let's go, Cunning Penguin.

927
00:59:39,982 --> 00:59:41,932
What do you mean 
Cunning Penguin?

928
00:59:41,932 --> 00:59:43,462
Accept it, Cunning Penguin.

929
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:44,562
Accept what?

930
00:59:44,562 --> 00:59:46,642
Let's not argue.

931
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:48,832
Let's go!

932
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:51,442
The upcoming S/S line 
color palette...

933
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:53,032
 Hello. 

934
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:54,802
That's what I'm considering.

935
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:56,162
 Hello. 

936
00:59:56,162 --> 00:59:58,502
 Hello. 

937
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:14,342
CEO.

938
01:00:14,342 --> 01:00:17,242
Then we'll go with the pastel tone.

939
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:18,642
Good day.

940
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:22,262
Yes, hyungnim.

941
01:00:22,262 --> 01:00:24,862
We depend on your 
company, hyungnim.

942
01:00:24,862 --> 01:00:26,942
I'm facing your direction now.

943
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:29,012
Please sponsor us strongly.

944
01:00:30,682 --> 01:00:32,462
Ms. Lee Bit Chae Woon?

945
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:40,312
 I heard Ms. Lee decided to 
work on a site in Busan. 

946
01:00:40,312 --> 01:00:42,252
 She's coming down for 
an interview today. 

947
01:00:47,842 --> 01:00:50,282
 

948
01:01:21,332 --> 01:01:25,072
 Mom, I'll be in Busan for a while. 

949
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:27,092
 Working on a site there. 

950
01:01:27,092 --> 01:01:30,072
 I'll make some money 
and cool my head. 

951
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:31,902
 Don't worry. 

952
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:58,662
I'll miss him...

953
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:01,862
Koala.

954
01:02:55,152 --> 01:02:58,922
The DNA test result is out.

955
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:04,022
 

956
01:03:45,172 --> 01:03:46,602
Koala.

957
01:03:46,602 --> 01:03:49,402
Headbutt, you're helpless.

958
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:53,272
You pretended to be happy this
 morning. What's going on?

959
01:03:53,272 --> 01:03:57,742
After putting everyone at ease, 
are you running away this way?

960
01:03:57,742 --> 01:04:00,082
I'm not running away.

961
01:04:00,082 --> 01:04:02,022
I'm going to make money.

962
01:04:02,022 --> 01:04:03,132
I'm the oldest daughter.

963
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:04,982
I told you I'd let you make money.

964
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:07,122
Come to my company 
and make money.

965
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,852
Thanks but...

966
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:13,882
I also want to cool my head.

967
01:04:15,512 --> 01:04:18,922
Do you think the job will 
wait for you until then?

968
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,632
Well...

969
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:23,952
if it's gone...

970
01:04:23,952 --> 01:04:25,732
I can't help that.

971
01:04:29,392 --> 01:04:30,942
I'm off.

972
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:36,302
Headbutt.

973
01:04:36,302 --> 01:04:37,672
Bit Chae Woon.

974
01:04:37,672 --> 01:04:39,372
Hey!

975
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,852
What?

976
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,412
What?

977
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:54,232
You can't help it if the job is gone?

978
01:04:54,232 --> 01:04:56,512
You really don't know how I feel?

979
01:04:56,512 --> 01:04:58,902
I can't help it.

980
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:02,602
I can't do anything 
because I miss you.

981
01:05:03,512 --> 01:05:06,542
Why do you keep ignoring me? 
Why do you...

982
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,372
Gosh, seriously.

983
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:15,352
So...

984
01:05:15,352 --> 01:05:17,442
you like me?

985
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:21,592
How many times must I tell you?

986
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:24,702
Are you James? 
You keep forgetting.

987
01:05:29,242 --> 01:05:32,522
Do you still like me now?

988
01:05:33,682 --> 01:05:35,462
That's right, man!

989
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:43,542
How about...

990
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:45,722
that? What's going on?

991
01:05:45,722 --> 01:05:46,862
What?

992
01:05:46,862 --> 01:05:48,442
That.

993
01:05:50,032 --> 01:05:52,692
Your relationship with Jang Seo Ah.

994
01:05:55,742 --> 01:05:58,782
Why are you so suspicious?

995
01:05:58,782 --> 01:06:01,692
My mouth hurts to 
say it at this point.

996
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,562
Whatever. Leave if you want to.

997
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:10,832
Geez, come on.

998
01:06:10,832 --> 01:06:12,282
Wait.

999
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:18,752
So?

1000
01:06:20,232 --> 01:06:22,252
You still like me?

1001
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:26,912
Yeah.

1002
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:31,692
I like you.

1003
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:33,972
What will you do about it?

1004
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:37,582
I like you.

1005
01:06:37,582 --> 01:06:40,972
I like you. I'm into you. 
Totally into you.

1006
01:06:40,972 --> 01:06:43,062
I like you. I'm into you.

1007
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:52,032
I...

1008
01:06:53,212 --> 01:06:54,962
like you, too.

1009
01:07:08,642 --> 01:07:21,442
♫  Here I am trying to ignore you 
when you're filling up my heart  ♫

1010
01:07:23,742 --> 01:07:36,042
♫  But I already know that I want you  ♫

1011
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:50,932
♫  I want to dwell forever 
in your glance  ♫

1012
01:07:50,942 --> 01:08:03,042
♫  I can't bear loving you 
when I can't be with you  ♫

1013
01:08:06,142 --> 01:08:18,942
♫  I'm looking at your back as 
you get further away from me  ♫

1014
01:08:18,952 --> 01:08:22,302
♫  You'll never know the sadness
 I feel as I turn away  ♫

1015
01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:24,052
 

1016
01:08:24,052 --> 01:08:25,522
 Hi, Hwang Na Ro. 

1017
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:27,332
 I'm here. 

1018
01:08:27,332 --> 01:08:29,172
 You haven't eaten lunch yet? 

1019
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:31,052
 - Na Ro oppa.
- Hae Deun. 

1020
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:33,202
 Pil Hong told you to do this, right? 

1021
01:08:33,202 --> 01:08:34,672
 Was someone in here? 

1022
01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:36,422
 A part-time job to act like someone. 

1023
01:08:36,422 --> 01:08:37,232
 Jung Hoo! 

1024
01:08:37,232 --> 01:08:38,862
 - Jae Hee!
- Mom? 

1025
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:43,452
 President, you're back. 

1026
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,762
 Hi, how is everything going? 

1027
01:08:45,762 --> 01:08:47,512
 I did well today, huh? 

1028
01:08:50,702 --> 01:08:52,792
 - Mom?
- Woo Jung Hoo, Woo Jae Hee! 

1029
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:53,852
 Get out right now! 

1030
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:56,292
 I'll accept whatever the punishment. 

1031
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:59,602
 I don't want to be 
your daughter, CEO. 

1032
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:02,122
 Bit Chae Woon, how could you... 

1033
01:09:02,122 --> 01:09:04,752
 Seo Ah, you can have everything. 

1034
01:09:04,752 --> 01:09:08,506
♫  I can feel it even though 
we're apart for a while  ♫
