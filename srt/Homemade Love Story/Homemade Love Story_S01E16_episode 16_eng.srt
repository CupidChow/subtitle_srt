1
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,340
You can cry now,

2
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,810
as much as you want.

3
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,800
  Somebody stole... Seo Yeon.  

4
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,200
  That person abandoned me, right?  

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,200
    
    

6
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,490
     

7
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,240
You should drink something sweet first.

8
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,990
The store didn't have anything warm.

9
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,310
Is it too cold? One second.

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,700
Ah, I wash my armpit really clean every day... So, don't worry about it.

11
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,680
You should drink this first, and let's go to eat something.

12
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,990
I looked up, and there's an amazing pork rib restaurant near here!

13
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,470
Let's go there and eat tons of pork!

14
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,120
Is the drink too cold? Ah, you must be cold right now.

15
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Then, let's go to a resting stop and have something warm first.

16
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,100
I drank all already.

17
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,700
Ah, you drank all already. That was fast...

18
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,340
Then, should we carry this momentum and go for the pork rib?

19
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,350
I guess you want beef... Alright, then shall we go for the short rib steak?

20
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,830
You are very picky...

21
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,050
Let's go somewhere.

22
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,000
Somewhere that nobody will come. A place where it's very remote?

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,300
Where nobody will come... and very remote?

24
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,260
What are you going to do there..?

25
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,720
Are you really going to be okay?

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,100
This one?

27
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,300
♫   Life is like that. Everybody comes with nothing   ♫

28
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:56,000
♫  And living while spreading a story like a novel all over the world   ♫

29
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,700
♫   Don't be disappointed in yourself. You can't do everything well   ♫

30
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:11,050
♫  As long as tomorrow is better than today. Focus on your life now   ♫

31
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,130
♫  Amore Party  ♫

32
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,730
♫  Amore Party  ♫

33
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,140
Are you not tired? I think you danced a lot.

34
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,420
What about you?

35
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,400
I didn't do anything.

36
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,300
But I'm happy to see you smile.

37
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,780
- Why are you not asking me? 
 - I'm sorry?

38
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,900
That what is going on with me.

39
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:17,600
What happened to me that I'm laughing, crying, dancing, and having these ups and downs.

40
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,250
I think it was a really really big thing that happened to you.

41
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,610
If a strong person like you is being like this.

42
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,000
Also, you're not going to tell me even though I ask you. Because you always take care of everything by yourself.

43
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,340
But I'm glad you called me. This is a huge level-up for me.

44
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,510
We can start from here.

45
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,400
You can share a spoonful of your worries with me,

46
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,450
and that can grow to a handful, and maybe later, it'll be a big bagful.

47
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,750
  Yes, he's Seo Ah's boyfriend.  

48
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,600
That wouldn't happen.

49
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,920
Today is an exception.

50
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,330
- Shall we go back? 
 - Wait.

51
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I think it'll happen.

52
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,700
There'll be a lot in the future. I'm sure it will be like that.

53
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,990
Chae Woon.

54
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,920
You're not alone. You have me.

55
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,960
Just call out 'Koala!' whenever you want.

56
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then, I'll run to you at any time.

57
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,670
Thank you.

58
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,400
She's really good at pushing me away.

59
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,910
     

60
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,800
Is she a devil or what?

61
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,440
  The person you're calling can't be reached. It'll be connected to the voicemail.  

62
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,320
Why is he not picking up the phone?

63
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,740
     

64
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,440
  The person you're calling can't be reached. It'll be connected to the voicemail...  

65
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,570
Bit Chae Woon...

66
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,100
Is she... with Woo Jae Hee right now?

67
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,560
    
    

68
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,500
  The person you're calling can't be reached. It'll be connected to the voicemail.  

69
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,400
What would have happened to her?

70
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,080
     

71
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,570
I really look like her.

72
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,340
  She had a daughter in her first marriage,  

73
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,820
  but then she lost that daughter. I don't know if she found her or not.  

74
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm positive. She must be my mom.

75
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,700
Oh! She came to our place to see me!

76
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,610
I didn't know that!

77
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm such an idiot!

78
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,800
  Thank you! Good night!  

79
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,980
Wow, tonight is so busy.

80
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,590
The owner is not here tonight. He went home when it's this busy here.

81
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,760
- Why? 
 -  I thought the handsome owner will be here since it's busy tonight.

82
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,880
- I'm disappointed. 
 - What is that? 
      

83
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,820
- Are you really here to see our owner's face? 
 - Of course! Then who am I going to see besides him?

84
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,430
- I should just go home. 
   - Auntie!  

85
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
  Yes, Hae Deun!  

86
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,200
I guess you came out because you want to eat jokbal. Then I should get it for you, what can I do? Let's go.

87
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,970
- I want to have fried chicken. 
 - You called me you want to have jokbal!

88
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Ah, they gathered again.

89
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,610
What's wrong with your face?

90
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,350
Aigo! That face is disrespectful for this delicious jokbal!

91
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,100
  I have to say goodbye to Hwak Se uncle and Man Jung auntie as well.  

92
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,500
  I really wanted to see him debuting as a singer.  

93
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,200
  Auntie, wait a little bit. I'll send you a ton of money for you to open your own practice!  

94
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,730
Hey.

95
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,200
Tell me the truth. What did you buy?

96
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,740
A bag? A pair of shoes? Did you buy it in a 12-month installment?

97
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,990
Tell me, Hae Deun.

98
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,500
My goodness, Lee Hae Deun. I thought you were quiet these days. Are you bragging that you're making money?

99
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:31,950
Aigo! Our prestigious Seohan university student, Lee Ra Hoon! He looks so tired after studying all day long.

100
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,640
- Ra Hoon, eat as much as you want. 
 - Ah, yes.

101
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,310
  My brother, Ra Hoon.   

102
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:43,530
  I always beat him up, and I took him for granted. I should've been nice to you.  

103
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,280
Why? Do you need money? How much should I lend you again?

104
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,310
Ra Hoon, do you want to go to study abroad?

105
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,230
I'll pay for you.

106
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,600
If you want to go next year, I think you should start preparing for it now. Where should we start?

107
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:13,180
Listen to me! You know, that an MBA or something like that, that thing you do it abroad.

108
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,930
Why are you laughing?

109
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,100
  - What's going on with you? 
 - Why are you laughing?  

110
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,870
I'll be back from the bathroom.

111
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,400
What are you doing here? Are you crazy?

112
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,100
- Why? I'm here as Cha Ba Reun. 
 - Cha Ba Reun...

113
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,000
- You should go. 
   - Thank you! Please visit us again!  

114
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,500
- Ra Hoon! 
 - Yes?

115
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,220
- What are you doing here? 
 - I was... um...

116
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,800
- Hello! 
 - Hello...

117
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,100
Who is this?

118
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,430
Hello! Hello, aunt.

119
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,290
Oh? Wait.

120
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,600
I thought you look familiar. You were the one who came to our place to rent a room.

121
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,910
  - She wanted to rent a room in Samgwang villa, but we didn't have any room left for a girl. 
 - Oh, so she couldn't get a room.  

122
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,660
Did you want to get a room in our place?

123
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,500
- Because you wanted to live with Ra Hoon? 
 - No, it's not like that, noona.

124
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,630
It is like that! Thank goodness there was no room available.

125
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,520
- So, did you find a place? 
 - Ah, yes.

126
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,450
'Ah, yes.' Wow, she's pretending to be so coy. She's not like that.

127
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,660
- Hey, you. 
 - Yes?

128
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,080
How did you know I was his aunt?

129
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,430
I just...

130
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,520
You look so cute when you're panicking! Of course, I'll be his aunt. What am I going to be, his daughter?

131
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,970
Dad!

132
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,440
Thank goodness she thought you were his aunt. You look like his great-aunt, honestly.

133
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,910
- Argh! That hurts! 
 - Just die!

134
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,080
If I just look at your face, you look like an older sister, but Ra Hoon told me that he has an aunt who's a doctor.

135
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:10,370
When I saw you from the distance, you looked so intellectual, so I thought you must be the aunt he told me before.

136
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,450
Wow, that vixen is crazy.

137
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,160
I do look intellectual.

138
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,300
You're really good at schmoozing.

139
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,250
  I don't like someone like that.  

140
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,900
Right? She has been hitting on Ra Hoon a lot! I know a lot about it.

141
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,680
- Really? 
 - What are you talking about, noona? That never happened.

142
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,470
Hey. Our Ra Hoon is not a guy you can just date just because you want to.

143
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,160
There were tons of girls like you until now!

144
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,580
  - Yes! There were tons of girls! 
 - Right?  

145
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,930
What's wrong with you two! Both of you against her together. She got scared!

146
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,700
  Did you get scared? I'm sorry! It was a joke!  

147
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,750
It's a joke! Don't be scared. I was messing with you.

148
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,960
She's drunk...

149
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,600
- You have to go now, right? I'll walk with you to the bus stop. 
 - Yes!

150
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,400
  - Oh my, Ra Hoon, are you guys dating already?   
 - It's not like that.

151
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,300
Then, I'll see you again!

152
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,400
Yes, Cha Ba Reun! You should live with pride! Don't be afraid!

153
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,200
They are both ridiculous!

154
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,270
Wow, I was so nervous.

155
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
Why are you pretending to be my girlfriend?

156
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,170
- I'm your girlfriend. 
 - When did we start dating?

157
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,160
Isn't it dating if you like each other?

158
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,020
Your face gets red whenever you see me.

159
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,400
No, that never happened.

160
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,500
I...

161
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,970
I always carry this around with me. The thing that you wrote. 
      

162
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,280
- I'm going to add another one. 
 - Don't pretend to be the girlfriend?

163
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,000
- How can you add that without my agreement? 
 - Who was the person moved into our place without my agreement?

164
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,780
Sure. Then, do you want to get rid of this and just leave Samgwang villa?

165
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,900
Alright, I'll agree.

166
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
- Hey, are you guys really dating? 
 - No! 
 - Yes, unni.

167
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,700
'Yes, unni?'

168
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,700
You heard me. Stop hitting on my brother, and don't come back to our neighborhood!

169
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,180
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

170
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,800
W-What!

171
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,900
If you don't understand someone's feeling of liking someone, it's because you never dated anybody.

172
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,900
I do have a boyfriend!

173
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,700
- A guy from the same university as you guys! 
 - Really?

174
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,020
Is that so? What's his name?

175
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,550
I know a lot of people in our school.

176
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,000
What's his name?

177
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,200
That, um... Kim Joon Woo! There's a guy named Kim Joon Woo!

178
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,400
- Oh, my goodness... 
 - He's taking a semester off. But I'm dating a younger guy. He rented our place where you didn't get it.

179
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,010
Ah! That Kim Joon Woo?

180
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,610
I know him a bit as well. He's a good guy.

181
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,530
- Noona, let's go home.  
 - Why? I still have things to talk to her about.

182
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,400
- Let's go. 
 - What?

183
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,700
Lee Hae Deun unni. She's being a difficult sister-in-law already!

184
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,970
Why! It hurts!

185
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
My god! Let me go!

186
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,250
Noona, I'm really sorry.

187
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,130
- What about it? 
 - I'm just sorry for everything.

188
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,180
  What an embarrassment and humiliation! What should I do? It's all because of me.  

189
00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:00,620
  Lee Ra Hoon. If I leave the house, I won't be able to hug you like this as a brother anymore.  

190
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,170
Oh, mom!

191
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,600
- Mom, you're late. Was there a lot of work? 
 - Yes...

192
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,880
Aigo, my mom must have had a hard time today.

193
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,480
- What about your sister? 
 - She didn't come home yet.

194
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,500
- She didn't call you? 
 - We don't call each other that often. Let's go inside, mom.

195
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,800
- I'll call her now. 
 - Yes.

196
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,580
- Mother, are you coming home now? 
 - Yes.

197
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,600
- She's not picking up the phone. 
 - Is that so?

198
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,900
Let's go inside, mom.

199
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,360
I'm worried about Bit Chae Woon...

200
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,710
Mom.

201
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:16,860
Ever since I was young, I liked to see you change into a home dress like now.

202
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,740
Why?

203
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,300
Because it means you're not going out again. Now you're going to have time with us.

204
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,110
  This is the biggest problem of all. Saying goodbye to my mom.   

205
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Mom...

206
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,410
My goodness...

207
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,300
Why are you like this all of a sudden? You smell like alcohol.

208
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,500
I only drank a glass.

209
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,440
- You should go. I want to have some rest. 
 - Let me stay a little bit more.

210
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,980
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

211
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,600
I was always a trouble for you, right? I regret it a lot.

212
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,200
My goodness. Are you getting married tomorrow? Are you going somewhere?

213
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,090
  I'm going to leave soon, to my biological mother.  

214
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,000
You were not a trouble for me.

215
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,430
I don't remember anything like that.

216
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,930
Then, what do you remember?

217
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,270
I remember you did something pretty.

218
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,150
What did I do something pretty?

219
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,090
You were pretty when you smile,

220
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,880
and you were pretty when you cry.

221
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,900
You were pretty when you fart as well.

222
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,700
Everything was pretty.

223
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,000
You and Ra Hoon,

224
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,300
and your sister, all of you.

225
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,270
Mom...

226
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,120
  All of you were pretty.  

227
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,700
  You were all so pretty that it was a shame to see the time goes by.  

228
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,270
Thank you for everything today.

229
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,520
I was thankful, too, because you called me.

230
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,970
I want to be thanked in the future as well.

231
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,760
What's wrong?

232
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,830
I should go to the convenience store. I have something to get.

233
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,290
- Let's go together. 
 - No, you should go inside first. I'll be back soon.

234
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,290
- Promise you won't go somewhere else. 
 - Sure.

235
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,950
  Suddenly, my home looked foreign to me.  

236
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,180
  I always wanted to escape from the house.  

237
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:59,800
  But in fact, I did not belong to that house nor any other place.  

238
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,550
  I was a person who's not in this world.  

239
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Oh, president! I'm home.

240
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,300
Mr. Woo! You're late.

241
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,100
Chae Woon will come home soon. She said she's going to the convenience store for a second.

242
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,040
Did you two come together?

243
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,300
Yes, we had dinner together as well.

244
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,150
Is that so.

245
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm just wondering, our Chae Woon...

246
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,470
She ate dinner well and she looked fine.

247
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,560
That's good to hear.

248
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,880
Thank you, Mr. Woo.

249
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,700
Don't worry too much. I don't know what's going on, but Chae Woon will be fine. She's a strong person.

250
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,180
Right, thank you. You should go in.

251
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,400
- I'm going to stay here outside for a bit more. 
 - Okay.

252
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,530
Why is she not coming back from the convenience store for this long?

253
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,950
  She ate dinner well and she looked fine.  

254
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,920
Are they close to each other?

255
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,940
  - Do you know Mr. Woo? 
 - Yes, he's Seo Ah's boyfriend.  

256
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,290
I guess it's because they live in the same house.

257
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
     

258
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes, Chae Woon! Why are you not coming home yet? I heard you're almost here.

259
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,360
Hae Joo's place?

260
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,980
Yes. I just need some refreshing time, so I'll sleepover at Hae Joo's place tonight.

261
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,410
Why? I heard you came near home.

262
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,890
Alright. When you get to her place, text me.

263
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,250
Yes, mom. Don't worry about me.

264
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,000
- Oh, mom! 
   - Yes?  

265
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,420
I...

266
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,620
  Mom, did you know that I was considered dead?  

267
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,370
  Why didn't you tell me about this?  

268
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,070
Chae Woon.

269
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,350
  Where are you now?  

270
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,100
  - I couldn't ask her. 
 - Chae Woon, I'll come to where you are.  

271
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,850
  Because she might have known about this.  

272
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,900
Oh, the bus is here now. I'll talk to you later, mom!

273
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Chae Woon!

274
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
What are you doing here?

275
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,420
Na Ro...

276
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,200
I was going to see my friend.

277
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,190
I called you multiple times because I was worried about you! But you didn't pick up.

278
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,900
What were you worried about?

279
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,310
Yesterday or at work, it looked like something was going on with you.

280
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,200
'Why were you worried about me?' You're going to ask me this, right?

281
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,300
I'll get going.

282
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,010
I came all the way here because I was worried about you, but if you go like this, I'd be so embarrassed.

283
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,290
You said you don't know about your biological parents.

284
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,190
Right.

285
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,150
How would you feel if you met your biological parents?

286
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,260
Well, I don't know because I haven't thought much about it.

287
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,410
I didn't expect much about it.

288
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
That's a lie.

289
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,430
It's a lie?

290
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,900
How can you not expect it? You must have pretended you don't expect anything.

291
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,570
As if it's nothing.

292
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,320
Shall we go for a drink?

293
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,750
Why don't we? I want to.

294
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,220
-Na Ro. 
 - Yes?

295
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,300
Don't keep trying to come close to me all of a sudden. It makes me think like 'Why is he doing this?'

296
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,100
It's because I like you, Bit Chae Woon.

297
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,920
Why don't we just be friendly Samgwang people? Let's not make our relationship awkward.

298
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,350
Let's have a drink all together next time.

299
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm not in a good situation right now.

300
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,630
Thank you for coming out to check on me.

301
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,770
Then, is it also for Woo Jae Hee?

302
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,860
I'm asking is he also just a friendly Samgwang person.

303
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,200
Oh, my bus is here. I'll get going.

304
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,300
You didn't answer my question.

305
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,790
James, what are you doing in there?

306
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,060
Oh, my! When did the water start leaking?

307
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,700
- From early evening today. 
 - Then, you should've told somebody!

308
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:53,800
Yesterday and today, it seemed to be something going on with everybody.

309
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,410
So I couldn't make them worry about this as well.

310
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,990
  Father, why did you change so much?  

311
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,470
Then what were you going to do? Were you going to stand like this the whole night?

312
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,500
I was waiting for you to come home, Yoo Jae Hee.

313
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,100
Why? Because you know I do this kind of work-- Wait, did you get your memory back?

314
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,540
No, somehow I feel the most comfortable with you, Yoo Jae Hee.

315
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,900
- I'm not Yoo Jae Hee-- 
 - I know. It's a joke.

316
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,160
Oh, my, Mr. Woo!

317
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,680
Where did it go?

318
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,400
Thank you for your hard work.

319
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,510
Noonim, I'm home! What happened to my room?

320
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:57,480
The water tank broke, and there's a leak. I took care of it for now, but I need to do some construction for a few days.

321
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,000
- Is that so?  
 - But it's very fortunate that we have Jae Hee oppa at home, isn't that right, Na Ro ahjussi?

322
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,420
Oh, there's no more leak now.

323
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,830
Wow, Yoo Jae Hee, you're amazing.

324
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,710
But the boiler wouldn't work tonight.

325
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,070
- That's fine. 
 - Uncle, I don't think you can sleep in this room tonight.

326
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Why not?

327
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,960
- There's a big hole. 
 - I knocked down the ceiling so I can tear out the pipes.

328
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,660
  I think nobody can sleep in this room tonight.  

329
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,300
I know. Wow, he just knocked down the whole thing.

330
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,400
Are you really going to be okay sleeping here?

331
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,590
Of course! I slept on the street before. It's fine.

332
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,790
Why don't you sleep with me in my room tonight?

333
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,220
  What should I do with Cha Ba Reun?  

334
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,240
No, it's okay. Your room is too crowded.

335
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,800
By the way, the new renter Kim Joon Woo, he's not even coming out when this mess is going on?

336
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,920
I mean a drunk person is one thing,

337
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,840
but if they also live in Samgwang villa together, then he should come out and help with us!

338
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,500
That's right!

339
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,700
  You're being really selfish!  

340
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,200
  - I know! It's very selfish! 
 - Right!  

341
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,500
Aigo, Hae Deun! He must have a reason. Be quiet, all of you.

342
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Speaking of him, I didn't even see Kim Joon Woo's face until now.

343
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,000
- Did you see him? 
 - No.

344
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,930
Did you?

345
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,900
Yes, I did.

346
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:42,409
I don't think you saw him.

347
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:46,929
You have a habit of not listening to the elders, Mr. penguin.

348
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,739
- Penguin? 
   - He looks like it.  

349
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,689
Are you really going to be okay to sleep here, James? It's going to be cold at night.

350
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,119
I'll be fine.

351
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:59,689
James, it's too cold here.

352
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:06,139
- Hae Deun, go and wake your auntie now. You two should sleep in Chae Woon's room tonight. 
 - Okay.

353
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:09,739
James, you should sleep in Man Jung's room tonight.

354
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,539
No, I'm fine.

355
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:14,759
Mom! Auntie's not moving at all. She's totally wasted.

356
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:17,549
- My goodness, Man Jung! 
 - Then!

357
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:25,449
- Why don't you sleep with me in my room? 
 - Is that okay with you?

358
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:30,759
- Yes, sure... 
 - Okay.

359
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:37,119
- Alright! Everybody, let's break up! It's over! I'm sleeping! 
 - Good night.

360
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:42,619
- I guess Chae Woon is sleeping? 
 - She didn't come home yet.

361
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,979
Oh, Chae Woon is going to stay over at her friend's place tonight.

362
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:52,869
- Something happened to her friend all of a sudden. 
   - Oh, really?  

363
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:56,549
Okay, I'm going to bed now.

364
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:01,269
- Everybody should go to their rooms! 
 - Okay, good night!

365
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:06,069
  - Mr. Woo, you, too!   
 - Yes.

366
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:13,619
  Bit Chae Woon, how can you run away like that? My consolation was useless.  

367
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:17,619
  Are you okay?  

368
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,589
I'm sorry to make you uncomfortable because of me.

369
00:36:25,629 --> 00:36:28,649
It's not like that. You should go to sleep.

370
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:32,559
I think I can sleep well tonight.

371
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:36,459
Were you having trouble sleeping these days?

372
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:42,039
A little bit. But somehow I feel very comfortable tonight.

373
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:46,579
I think you were having a good night's sleep the whole time...

374
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:59,699
  How would I ever imagined sleeping with my father in the same room?  

375
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:26,139
  Chae Woon, I'm just really worried about you.  

376
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:34,319
Maybe I'm keeping her awake.

377
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,289
  Stop worrying about me and have some sleep. I'm going to bed.  

378
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:07,989
  Thank you for the text. Good night, my daughter.  

379
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:11,779
'My daughter.'

380
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,289
My mom's daughter...

381
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:34,799
  Just text me these three words. 'I'm doing fine.' If you don't, then I can't sleep tonight.  

382
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:47,919
  I'm doing fine.  

383
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,919
  It's all my fault.  

384
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,699
  I couldn't protect her.  

385
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:31,139
  I can't trust anybody.  

386
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,099
Oh, Ms. Bit Chae Woon, are you sick?

387
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:39,489
Alright, take care.

388
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:42,499
I'll take care of it.

389
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:47,229
Is Ms. Bit Chae Woon sick?

390
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:52,229
Ah, CEO. She's said she got a cold and taking a day off today.

391
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:56,109
Alright, go back to your work, everybody.

392
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:19,819
Oh, Ms.Lee. Is there anything for me to help you?

393
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,429
Oh, no. Ms.Lee!

394
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,939
Yes..?

395
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:27,439
You should put the food in the refrigerator...

396
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,339
Oh, yes...

397
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,339
     

398
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:50,059
Yes, hello.

399
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,289
Chae Woon?

400
00:41:55,329 --> 00:42:00,359
I heard that she took a day off because of a cold. Is she severely sick?

401
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:05,139
Oh, yes, I mean she's a bit sick.

402
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,899
She's sleeping right now.

403
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:10,079
The oldest daughter didn't go to work today?

404
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:17,139
I'm so sorry to make you worry.

405
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:22,639
Tell her that I'm very worried and get better soon or I'll be angry.

406
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,349
Yes...

407
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:31,139
     

408
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:34,409
  Are you okay?  

409
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:38,939
  The person you're calling can't be reached... 

410
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:45,679
Why is she not picking up the phone?

411
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,639
     

412
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:52,039
     

413
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,669
  It's Ms. Kim Jung Won.  

414
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:21,609
  Seo Yeon. She's my daughter who left me far away a long time ago.  

415
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:33,689
  I'm wearing shoes, so I'm okay.  

416
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:52,759
You're going to dislocate your shoulder if you swing it like that.

417
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:59,659
  - Oh, no. What am I going to do? 
 - I know. She's my boyfriend's mother.  

418
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,539
  Is she Woo Jae Hee's mother?  

419
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,489
I was looking at you swinging, but you only have power and no techniques.

420
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,439
You should try to place the ball exactly on the swing spot to get a home run with less power.

421
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:11,509
Look at me doing it. Hold this.

422
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:17,039
Put your legs apart like this, stick your butt out, and hold the bat like this.

423
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:19,739
- Put in a 1000 won in it now. 
 - Ah, yes.

424
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:23,859
Again, again.

425
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,439
What's wrong with the balls!

426
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,869
Look at me again!

427
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:42,979
Thank you so much.

428
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:47,539
I didn't have any luck today. I'm not like this usually.

429
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:51,619
On a day like this, we have to drink some beer from the day time.

430
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:54,359
But I have a medicine that I'm taking these days.

431
00:44:54,769 --> 00:45:00,319
Oh! Thank you so much for helping me the other day! The clothes were really pretty.

432
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:06,479
- Ah, those clothes were brought by Director Jang... 
 - I don't think she brought it.

433
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:11,019
Seo Ah's really good at intercepting someone else's thing. That's what she does all the time.

434
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,039
Are you trying to break your head by headbutting it?

435
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:36,639
     

436
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:42,139
     

437
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,179
Is that a guy who's bothering you?

438
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:52,009
- No, it's not like that. 
 - My son looks like a koala, too. Ah, I miss my son!

439
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:57,339
    
          

440
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:02,619
  Bit Chae Woon, can you please send me just three words again?  

441
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:08,439
Is this a guy who's clinging to you? Just kick him away.

442
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:20,769
Ah, she's not even responding to the text.

443
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:30,039
By the way, where did my father go?

444
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:35,189
Hwak Se, please give me a chance!

445
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:39,999
I can totally do delivery in this neighborhood where I can walk.

446
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:48,309
Eems hyung! You don't remember anything from your past and how can you do delivery? If you want to do it, then you have to know every street around here.

447
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:54,779
It's weird, but only my old memories are erased, and I remember everything since the accident.

448
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:58,399
It includes stuff that I memorized and the streets as well.

449
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:03,389
Why don't you just let me try one time? Please?

450
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:09,709
I feel really bad that I'm totally dependent on everybody in Samgwang villa.

451
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:11,669
I mean hyungnim--

452
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:14,839
Yes?

453
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:17,989
Yes?

454
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,899
- Thank you. I hope you enjoy it. 
 - Thank you.

455
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:31,469
  Hwak Se!  

456
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:37,449
How is it? I'm good at it, right?

457
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,449
I'll do my best.

458
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:49,209
Alright. Then you can't go for far away ones, but only for this neighborhood.

459
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:53,909
Thank you, uncle. No, Hwak Se sunbaenim! 
     

460
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:56,879
I'm not a sunbaenim.

461
00:47:59,299 --> 00:48:03,989
Why don't you lie down for yourself? Operate it for them.

462
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:06,649
Is it comfortable?

463
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:08,419
  Mother!  

464
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:11,939
Oh, Seo Ah! Welcome.

465
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:15,189
- Mother, congratulations on your store's opening. 
 - Thank you.

466
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:18,999
- Congratulations. 
 - You didn't have to bring anything!

467
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:21,429
This place is very nice!

468
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:28,109
Mother. When your work is over, do you want to come with me to see Jae Hee's place?

469
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:31,649
Jae Hee's place? Do you know where he lives now?

470
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:36,759
Yes. Let's go together today.

471
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:38,429
Shall we?

472
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:45,489
I think it's time for her to get off from work.

473
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:06,839
Wow, is she really my mother?

474
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,899
Mom...

475
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:22,539
Mom?

476
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:26,889
Na Ro opp-- no, ahjussi, are you already out from work?

477
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:29,929
I can't run into my sister!

478
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:33,859
What's going on with Hae Deun?

479
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:37,809
I guess she doesn't know that Bit Chae Woon didn't come to work today.

480
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:43,889
You're the first person that I'm telling this story.

481
00:49:43,919 --> 00:49:46,329
Keep it secret from my family for now.

482
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,979
I think my mom knows about this already.

483
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:02,429
- Why? 
 - Yes?

484
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,739
Yes.

485
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:14,059
Hae Deun, I'm going to say just one thing.

486
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:15,819
No.

487
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:20,249
You're not the CEO's daughter.

488
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:25,649
How do you know about that?

489
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:29,629
Is there a rumor in the company?

490
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:34,689
I'm pretty good at getting top-secret information.

491
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:40,459
I'm really sorry to say this, but the CEO's daughter is a different person. It's right before to be revealed.

492
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:46,339
I think you might have been having hopes up that you might be a rich family's daughter,

493
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:51,469
but if your hopes are high, then the disappointment gets bigger. So you should forget about it now.

494
00:50:54,869 --> 00:51:02,339
You said you're in the same situation as me, but how can you say it like that?

495
00:51:03,189 --> 00:51:07,149
I wasn't getting excited to be a rich family's daughter.

496
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:12,469
I thought I really found my biological mother.

497
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:16,449
I thought she was my real mother.

498
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:24,429
I said this for your sake so you can get out of a delusion quickly...

499
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:37,149
Mr. Hwang Na Ro, you don't look like it, but I think you're a very cold-hearted person.

500
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:41,129
Is it because you grew up getting hurt a lot?

501
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:44,969
I'm not like that even though I got hurt a lot as well.

502
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,639
I believe you wouldn't tell this to my family.

503
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:55,479
Bye.

504
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:03,819
Hae Deun!

505
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:10,139
  It's okay, Lee Hae Deun! You're the queen of assuming things.  

506
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:14,369
  It's okay, it's okay.  

507
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:27,239
  Bit Chae Woon, do you know something as well? I should go check it out for myself. 

508
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:30,339
It's a beautiful neighborhood. It has beautiful scenery. Right, Seo Ah?

509
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:33,059
Yes. Oh, right.

510
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:37,889
Mother, the person who owns the villa where Jae Hee oppa lives--

511
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,279
Huh? Is that Jae Hee's father?

512
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:47,009
Why would he be here? He must be in the office.

513
00:52:47,029 --> 00:52:48,999
Right?

514
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:53,689
  Hello, ma'am! Aigo, my goodness.  

515
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,029
It is his voice!

516
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:59,089
- Is it? 
 - I think so.

517
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:02,919
  A-choo!  

518
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:08,179
  A-choo!  

519
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:18,519
That's his voice.

520
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,939
- Father! 
 - Woo Jung Hoo?

521
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:24,239
  Father!  

522
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:27,639
- Jae Hee's father! 
 - Father!

523
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:34,899
- Father! Father! 
 - Woo Jung Hoo?

524
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:35,989
Is it debt collectors?

525
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:37,939
  Father!  

526
00:53:48,439 --> 00:53:50,339
Father!

527
00:53:51,459 --> 00:53:55,199
It's so strange. He definitely looked like him.

528
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:02,969
Yes, Jae Hee.

529
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:05,569
You saw my father on the street?

530
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:10,239
I doubt it. Where are you now, mom?

531
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:13,609
What? To my place?

532
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:19,239
Yes, I think I'm near your place. But I saw a guy who looked like your father around here.

533
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:21,119
Yes, mom.

534
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:24,919
Mom! Stay right there! I'll go out now!

535
00:54:24,939 --> 00:54:27,039
No! We'll go to your place.

536
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:32,229
There's construction going on here, so it's a mess. Stay right there, I'll be there now! Stop, stop!

537
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:41,559
Why, mom? I'm almost here at Jae Hee oppa's place with his mother.

538
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,789
Seo Ah, listen to me.

539
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:50,629
Min Jae doesn't like Soon Jung that much.

540
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:53,929
- Why? 
 - Is it your mom?

541
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:56,839
  I'll tell you the details later.  

542
00:54:56,939 --> 00:55:00,139
And come to our place. Don't go there.

543
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:06,339
- Why not? 
 - You're going to put me in trouble! And Min Jae's illness might get worse.

544
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:09,949
Mom!

545
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:14,339
- Jae Hee. 
 - W-What do you mean by seeing my father?

546
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:19,009
He was right here. He looked very similar from the back.

547
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,739
The sound of 'A-choo!', the sneezing sound was similar as well.

548
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:30,559
What are you talking about it? Did you have some drinks?

549
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:36,739
- Mom, you like ttekbokki, right? There's a really famous place here for that. Let's go there. 
 - Really?

550
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:41,439
- I guess it wasn't him? 
 - Of course, it's not him.

551
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:04,969
Really?

552
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,169
I didn't know Min Jae and Soon Jung was in a love-triangle.

553
00:56:12,209 --> 00:56:17,629
So, I'm saying, what would Min Jae feel when she knows that Jae Hee lives in Soon Jung's place now?

554
00:56:17,649 --> 00:56:21,599
Also, Min Jae is getting over manic depression right now.

555
00:56:21,689 --> 00:56:25,259
  Let's keep this a secret just in between us, okay?  

556
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:27,389
Yes, mom.

557
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:40,419
Why are you not eating at all? Have some.

558
00:56:40,459 --> 00:56:42,789
Mom, have much as you want.

559
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:47,409
You're being weird since you saw me. You're making a dazed face.

560
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:52,239
But I'm good to see oppa no matter what. Right, mother?

561
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:59,669
Of course, I'm glad, too. Oh! I met this woman.

562
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,539
The one who helped me to take off the stain from my clothes, when I went to your company.

563
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:05,359
Do you mean by Bit Chae Woon?

564
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:09,559
Head-- I mean, at where?

565
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:11,469
Do you know her as well?

566
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:14,139
Ah, because of the work from the construction firm.

567
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:19,439
Oh, I didn't know she did that work as well! I met her earlier--

568
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:21,639
  They shouldn't know that she skipped her work, right?  

569
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:27,639
I met her earlier this week on Sunday at the pitching center. She was awesome!

570
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,869
You know I like a person like her.

571
00:57:29,939 --> 00:57:35,839
Who's a girl crush, with strong power, and with the eyes become like this when they smile.

572
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:37,939
Right.

573
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,639
A part-time delivery work?

574
00:57:40,649 --> 00:57:42,989
How can you let a person who's not in a healthy condition to do such a thing?

575
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,039
I told him he shouldn't do it. But he kept asking me.

576
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,539
Even if he asked you multiple times, what are you going to do if something happens to him?

577
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:54,049
But why are you so angry at me about this?

578
00:57:54,439 --> 00:58:00,339
I know. Mr. Woo, you're being overly dramatic about this.

579
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:06,799
Do you know how much Hwak Se took care of James?

580
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,839
If anybody sees this, people will think Kim Hwak Se did something terrible!

581
00:58:10,939 --> 00:58:14,339
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hwak Se.

582
00:58:15,249 --> 00:58:18,359
Why is he being overly dramatic when he's not his father?

583
00:58:18,439 --> 00:58:22,939
Your apology is insincere!

584
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:26,739
You have to do it right. My god...

585
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:30,459
You have to apologize in the right way, it's not a thing that you can just say ambiguously!

586
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:34,639
Why is everyone rude to Kim Hwak Se! It's ridiculous.

587
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:46,139
- Oh! Hello, owner. 
 - Hello.

588
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:49,259
- It's going well, right? 
 - Yes.

589
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:54,139
I knew it...

590
00:58:54,829 --> 00:59:01,259
- What are you going to do if you get lost? 
 - I'm sorry, Yoo Jae Hee.

591
00:59:01,299 --> 00:59:03,389
I told you I'm not Yoo Jae Hee.

592
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:07,209
- It's a joke-- 
 - Don't say that as well!

593
00:59:16,149 --> 00:59:20,519
What's going on? What's wrong?

594
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,239
You should've disinfected this right away!

595
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,979
Why did you leave this like this?

596
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:29,939
I thought it wasn't a big deal...

597
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,269
Ah, that stings.

598
00:59:38,259 --> 00:59:43,009
Why do you have so many scars?

599
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:46,019
Oh, you're right.

600
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:51,819
I guess I must have had a hard time in the past.

601
00:59:57,439 --> 01:00:00,639
  Have you ever saw my legs up closely?  

602
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:08,439
  You've never seen my legs that are torn, cracked, and pierced to feed my family!  

603
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:11,579
  Do you want me to show it to you? Do you!  

604
01:00:12,139 --> 01:00:14,199
  It's fine.  

605
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,139
  This punk! Hey, Woo Jae Hee. Hey!  

606
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:28,159
Why are you staring at it? It's embarrassing.

607
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:34,229
I should put this one on here.

608
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:36,039
I'll do it for you.

609
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:43,199
Thank you.

610
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:25,189
You should have a break! Do you know you had been working for three hours straight?

611
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:28,859
Yes, I'll take a break after this.

612
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:45,739
Yes.

613
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:50,219
  Hello, I'm Yoon Da Heen from LX Fashion.  

614
01:01:51,899 --> 01:01:56,109
  I'm calling you because Ms. Bit Chae Woon suddenly wants to quit the job.  

615
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,039
  I was wondering if something is going on.  

616
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:08,999
Chae Woon. Where are you?

617
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,139
What is going on? Why are you quitting your work?

618
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:15,949
Where are you now, Chae Woon?

619
01:02:32,539 --> 01:02:34,639
     

620
01:02:37,749 --> 01:02:47,749
  Chae Woon. Where are you? What is going on? Why are you quitting your work? Where are you now, Chae Woon?  

621
01:02:49,149 --> 01:02:52,089
How can I go to work in this situation?

622
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:23,259
  Chae Woon. I can't watch you breaking down like this anymore.  

623
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:26,819
  I'll take care of this.  

624
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:54,139
     

625
01:03:59,479 --> 01:04:01,539
Young lady Jung Won.

626
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:05,729
Yes, Soon Jung. Why did you call me?

627
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:10,459
Today? Sounds great!

628
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,369
  The person you're trying to reach can't be reached...  

629
01:04:37,399 --> 01:04:39,339
     

630
01:04:40,229 --> 01:04:42,749
  - Unni!   
 - Where's mom?

631
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,489
Yeonhui-dong? Okay.

632
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:49,039
     

633
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,839
  Your mom went out in a rush. Is there something going on in your family?  

634
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:16,519
  Soon Jung!  

635
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:18,559
Young lady...

636
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:21,739
I'm sorry to call you out when you're busy.

637
01:05:21,749 --> 01:05:27,589
No, I'm fine! If you call me, then I should come out no matter what.

638
01:05:28,289 --> 01:05:31,489
But what's wrong with your face?

639
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:35,309
You're going to be sick while taking care of your daughter!

640
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:37,019
Let's sit down.

641
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:44,459
Let's have tea and go to eat something healthy.

642
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:56,159
What do you want to talk about?

643
01:05:56,529 --> 01:05:59,559
What is it that you can't say it that easily?

644
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:08,239
Soon Jung, do you have some financial problems?

645
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:12,519
Just tell me. I'll help you with anything.

646
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:21,979
About...

647
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:28,509
About Seo Yeon.

648
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:33,319
Yes?

649
01:06:35,989 --> 01:06:38,299
Your daughter, young lady.

650
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:42,429
Seo Yeon.

651
01:06:45,169 --> 01:06:47,689
She's alive.

652
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:53,619
What?

653
01:06:55,899 --> 01:07:01,789
What are you talking about?

654
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:09,319
It's Chae Woon.

655
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:16,079
My daughter, Chae Woon.

656
01:07:20,259 --> 01:07:22,659
Chae Woon is...

657
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:28,359
Seo Yeon.

658
01:07:40,939 --> 01:07:47,339
Yes, Ms. Goo, it's Lee Bit Chae Woon. I'm supposed to meet the CEO today, but I can't find the place right now.

659
01:07:48,879 --> 01:07:50,939
How can you...

660
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:55,949
How can you do that to me?

661
01:07:57,899 --> 01:08:02,389
Lee Soon Jung, how can you! Do that to me..?

662
01:08:02,429 --> 01:08:06,809
How can you do that to me! How can you!

663
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:10,089
How can you do that to me!

664
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,899
How!

665
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:17,269
- Mom... 
 - How can you do that to me!

666
01:08:17,499 --> 01:08:20,609
How can you do that to me...

667
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:25,999
Mom.

668
01:08:27,549 --> 01:08:29,269
Mom!

669
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:00,919
     

670
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:02,109
  Did Seo Ah send that to me?  

671
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:05,439
  - I talked on the phone with Bit Chae Woon, and she was worried about you a lot. 
 - Are you guys close to each other?  

672
01:09:05,529 --> 01:09:07,969
  Can you help me with something?  

673
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:10,949
  - So you want me to pretend to be your father? 
 - Hello?  

674
01:09:10,989 --> 01:09:13,569
  Honey, why..?  

675
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:17,039
  Why? Of course, I'm fine! I'm busy! Have to go!  

676
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,939
  How is your mother?  

677
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:21,519
  - What do you think? 
 - What's wrong with your manners!  

678
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:23,539
  Unni was the real daughter of the CEO?  

679
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:25,839
  Is she going to live in that house from now on?  

680
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,659
  Even if that's real, I'm not moving to her place.  

681
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:32,849
  Mom, I'm going to be in Busan for awhile. Don't worry about me.  

682
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:36,289
  I got the genetic test.  

683
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:40,589
  Soon Jung, our relationship is over now.
