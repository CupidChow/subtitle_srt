1
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,040
 

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,220
Mom.

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,340
Gosh...

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,130
That's nonsense. What in the world?

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,430
What day is this?

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,560
Did they switch the April Fool's Day?

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,900
It's not today.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,240
Gosh.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,450
Mom.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,220
A joke like this isn't even funny.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,500
Gosh, I was shocked for no reason.

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,380
It's not a joke, Chae Woon.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,600
Well...

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,370
Because I always say I like my CEO

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,970
and since I was all smiles earlier 
when she stopped by,

16
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,380
you're jealous right now.

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,400
My gosh. Come here.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,890
Gosh.

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,090
Aigoo, my mom is such a baby.

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,750
How can I compare CEO and you?

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,950
You're so cute, Mom.

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,110
Mom.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,280
You're in shock, my daughter.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,970
 Are you sure this is you, 
Bit Chae Woon? 

25
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,370
 Yes. 

26
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,970
 Then... 

27
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,310
 Bit Chae Woon is Mom's daughter? 

28
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,660
Mom.

29
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,850
So, did you lose this baby?

30
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,600
How?

31
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,090
I'm not joking.

32
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,550
It's true, Chae Woon.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,420
Then...

34
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,750
Then you mean...

35
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,460
I didn't meet you at an orphanage?

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,370
You said someone dropped 
me off at an orphanage,

37
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,690
and that's how you and 
Dad came to raise me.

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Oh, no...

39
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,870
Why are you telling me that now?

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,020
Why are you telling me 
all this now?

41
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,070
Even before I started working
 at the company, no...

42
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,450
I mean, even before that.

43
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,660
Even way before that. 
Before I got to meet the CEO...

44
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,070
You could've looked for the 
CEO even before that, right?

45
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,050
In this day and age.

46
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,900
Okay. Yeah, fine.

47
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,970
Fine, let's just say we were
 too caught up in life for that.

48
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,250
We were busy making a living.

49
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,480
But you ran into the CEO at

50
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,070
Yeonhuidong madam's 
home after a long time.

51
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,960
Back then.

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,180
Why didn't you tell me 
right away back then?

53
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,190
You knew I was looking
 for my birth parents.

54
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,430
You greeted those people who 
came by, saying they're

55
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,080
my birth parents so
 warmly. So, why?

56
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,500
Huh?

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,560
Why?

58
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,490
I was...

59
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,050
I was too scared, Chae Woon.

60
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,160
I was too scared to let you go.

61
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,100
Mom!

62
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,840
I was...

63
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,250
I was too scared...

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,040
to give up being your mom.

65
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,540
I was too scared...

66
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,700
Sorry. Sorry, Mom.

67
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,900
I was being too pushy.

68
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
No, Chae Woon.

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,500
No, Chae Woon.

70
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,900
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,280
But...

72
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,950
It's okay.

73
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,000
Sorry.

74
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,710
But then...

75
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,640
the CEO...

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,090
had no idea that you 
were raising me?

77
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,130
How could that be?

78
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,410
After losing her daughter, 
she didn't look for me?

79
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,370
Why?

80
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,180
So...

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,400
she abandoned me. Right?

82
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,200
Why?

83
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,970
- No, Chae Woon.
- Why...

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,280
Why did she abandon me?

85
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,530
Why?

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,660
No, Chae Woon.

87
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,420
No, it's not like that.

88
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,170
It's not like that. She...

89
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,760
didn't abandon you.

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,210
Young Lady Jung Won
 isn't like that.

91
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,410
But you were...

92
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,590
How did I lose her?

93
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,310
It's all my fault.

94
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,420
All my fault.

95
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,650
I'm sure you tried to look for her.

96
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,910
I know how you are.

97
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,160
You must've looked for her all over...

98
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,810
Because I can't find her even
 if I looked everywhere.

99
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,530
She doesn't...

100
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,820
exist in this world anymore.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,100
 She thinks you're no longer alive. 

102
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,670
If she didn't abandon me, 
what is it then?

103
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,270
If she didn't abandon me, 
what is it then?

104
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,500
No.

105
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,370
Chae Woon, Chae Woon, 
it's not like that.

106
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,040
No.

107
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,770
I'm sure she abandoned me.

108
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,160
Well...

109
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,900
she must've gotten pregnant 
with me accidentally.

110
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,000
But she must've given me up 
since she couldn't raise me.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,700
If that weren't so,

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,280
why wouldn't you have told me 
right away after running into her?

113
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,920
You knew how desperately I was 
searching for my birth parents.

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
No.

115
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,650
No, Chae Woon.

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,160
It's not like that.

117
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,220
- I said no.
- Come on, Mom.

118
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,340
To where, Chae Woon?

119
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,910
To the CEO's house.

120
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,040
Let's go and ask her 
why she gave me up.

121
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,090
After giving up her birth 
daughter like that,

122
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,940
yet she supports orphanages 
and helps out the poor.

123
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,950
I'll ask her why she pretended
 to live like a good person.

124
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,010
Let's go.

125
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,140
Chae Woon. Chae Woon.

126
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,860
Don't do this.

127
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,160
Please calm down.

128
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,810
Chae Woon.

129
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,960
Whether it's tomorrow or the
 day after, let's go then.

130
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,120
Let's go together then 
and meet her.

131
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,860
I can't do that!

132
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,530
- Chae Woon!
- I can't do that!

133
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,990
Chae Woon...

134
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,650
If I stay like this,

135
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,540
I feel like my heart will explode.

136
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,340
I can't act gracefully 
and wait around.

137
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,940
I'll go to her tonight 
and hear her out

138
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,030
and get the DNA test right away.

139
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:04,000
Mom, you must've been prepared for
 this to set off a bomb like this.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,380
Let's go.

141
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,090
- Let's go!
- Chae Woon...

142
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,950
- Chae Woon!
- Let's go!

143
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,520
Chae Woon! Hey!

144
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,990
Should we just make one?

145
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,820
- We'll eat two anyway.
- Chae Woon!

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Chae Woon!

147
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,310
- Unni!
- What's going on?

148
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,020
What? Bit Chae!

149
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,530
Chae Woon. Chae Woon...

150
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,850
Gosh, Chae Woon.

151
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,280
It's cold. Let's grab a jacket.

152
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,770
Bit Chae, what's up?

153
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,310
Unni, are you going somewhere?

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,350
Hae Deun, go get a jacket for Mom.

155
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,520
What?

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,570
- Get a jacket for Mom.
- Oh, okay.

157
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,240
What? Are you going to argue 
with someone? A fight?

158
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,050
I'll go, too. Take me with you.

159
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,180
Man Jung, it's not like that.

160
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,840
We'll be right back.

161
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,900
So where are you going?

162
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,540
- Noona, what's going on?
- I don't know either.

163
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,530
- Unni!
- Ms. Lee, I'll drive you.

164
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,940
Wait...

165
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,090
- Ms. Lee.
- Ms. Lee?

166
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,500
Chae Woon.

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,990
I will drive you, Chae Woon.

168
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,420
Wait, Chae Woon...

169
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,620
Where are Noonim and
 Chae Woon going?

170
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,530
I don't know. They won't tell us.

171
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,390
They need me to duke it out.

172
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,840
I know, right?

173
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,450
What's going on?

174
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,270
 

175
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,460
 The customer can't answer
 the call right now. 

176
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,770
Headbutt, why don't you answer?

177
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,620
 
Headbutt?

178
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,000
I was going to make
 some ramen in peace.

179
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,250
What's up with this?

180
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,770
I can't believe the two 
of them just ran off.

181
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,740
Gosh, Mom's not answering, either.

182
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,590
Mom left her phone behind.

183
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

184
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,900
No matter how I think about it, 
don't you think this is that?

185
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,810
- What?
- Debt.

186
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,990
Debt. Creditors.

187
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,460
The creditors came 
looking for her again.

188
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,360
A long time ago, these bad 
guys deceived Noonim,

189
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,820
and she had so much debt to pay off. 
She had a hard time for a while.

190
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,150
Aigoo.

191
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,400
Ms. Lee went through
 such an ordeal?

192
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,500
Why are you blabbering 
on such a personal story?

193
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,290
I should just rip your mouth...

194
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,340
My gosh. Uncle, we don't
 have any debt anymore.

195
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,310
Mom and Unni said
 they paid it all off.

196
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,240
That's right. Chae Woon noona 
struggled so much because of that.

197
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,790
My Bit Chae sure struggled a lot.

198
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,580
Creditors are so scary.

199
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
Geez.

200
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,910
Wait, Eems hyung. What's wrong 
with you, Eems hyung?

201
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,870
Do you remember anything?

202
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,370
Oh, no...

203
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,400
Wow, seriously.

204
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,890
It's PTSD.

205
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,670
 Chae Woon. 

206
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,000
 Yeah? 

207
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,710
 Do you... 

208
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,540
 want to meet your birth mom? 

209
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,890
Don't stress out so much.

210
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,170
Breathe in and out. 
Breathe and stay still.

211
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
- Okay.
- Do you want some water?

212
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,030
No.

213
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,800
It can't be Bit Chae Woon.

214
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,280
No.

215
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,570
 Bit Chae Woon. 

216
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,880
 You know your baby picture 
you showed me last time? 

217
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,990
 Can you send it to me? 

218
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,470
 I keep thinking about it
 since it's so cute. 

219
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,300
What am I doing?

220
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,320
 - Here.
- Oh, my! 

221
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
 Oh, my! 

222
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,300
Call CEO and say we're here.

223
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,790
 

224
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,260
 

225
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,090
Mom.

226
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,830
We should meet her. 
We came all the way here.

227
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,250
Here.

228
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,650
Aigoo, so good.

229
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,990
Mom!

230
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,310
Mom!

231
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,460
- Hi, Chae Woon!
- I got 100%.

232
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,230
- Really?
- Yeah!

233
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,830
Oh, my gosh!

234
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,970
Chae Woon, good job!

235
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,200
My daughter, you did great!

236
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,530
Wait a minute.

237
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,320
Wait a minute.

238
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,280
- Let go, Chae Woon.
- Wait!

239
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,910
Chae Woon, we should...

240
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,230
Come.

241
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,140
I'll take a walk. It's too stuffy.

242
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,550
Be careful.

243
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,320
Ow.

244
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,670
Oh, sorry.

245
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,580
It hurt, huh?

246
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,700
No, it's okay.

247
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,300
My gosh.

248
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,340
You didn't even wear your socks.

249
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,350
I'm okay.

250
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,520
My goodness...

251
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
They're frozen cold.

252
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,800
My gosh.

253
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,030
Put these on.

254
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,530
It's okay. We'll get into a taxi.

255
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,080
Oh, no.

256
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,360
I'm wearing shoes. I'm fine.

257
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,930
Why did you stop me from 
ringing the doorbell?

258
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,810
You came running all the 
way here, out of curiosity.

259
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,730
Huh?

260
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,780
I was...

261
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,640
too scared.

262
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,760
Call Hae Deun.

263
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,620
Everyone must be worried.

264
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,860
You're telling the truth, right?

265
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,360
All right. Be careful coming home.

266
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,400
- What, what? What did she say?
- What did Chae Woon noona say?

267
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,230
She said it's nothing serious. 
She told us to go to sleep.

268
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,260
Why did they rush out?

269
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,830
Oh, I guess something happened 
at Yeonhuidong madam's house.

270
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,050
Gosh, that ahjumma.

271
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,080
She always calls Mom when
 she's fighting with her husband.

272
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,470
Geez, seriously.

273
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,400
But why did her oldest 
daughter go with her?

274
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,980
Well, Bit Chae is a fixer.

275
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,050
She's a fixer when it comes
 to troubleshooting.

276
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,820
Especially involving that 
person. Over there.

277
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,530
Troubles involving her.

278
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,940
Gosh, you're so ridiculous.

279
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,590
Na Ro.

280
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,880
Yes?

281
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,610
I said this before, but I'm sure 
I saw you somewhere.

282
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,980
So where?

283
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,130
That's what I can't remember.

284
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,780
Gosh, I should quit drinking.

285
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,240
Auntie, was he at 
an inappropriate place

286
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,190
and see something he 
shouldn't have seen?

287
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,210
So, where could that be?

288
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Geez, Woo Jae Hee.

289
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,320
A good-looking person 
hears that a lot.

290
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,360
Saying that I look very familiar.

291
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,360
A lot of people tell me that
 I look very familiar.

292
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,310
Especially from 
chic noonims like you.

293
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,140
- What?
- Who?

294
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,530
Na Ro.

295
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,560
You should open your eyes!

296
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,960
He does have his eyes open.

297
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,620
Gosh, why are you 
calling me "noonim"?

298
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,650
What do you mean 
I'm chic? I'm not.

299
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,740
What are you saying? 
You know that you are.

300
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,310
- What?
- What do you mean I know?

301
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,270
He's funny.

302
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,380
As for being good-looking,

303
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,590
Yoo Jae Hee is the
 good-looking one.

304
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,140
Yeah.

305
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,410
That is correct.

306
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,390
Let's hear the details when 
Ms. Lee comes back.

307
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,340
Let's disperse. It's getting late.

308
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,610
I'm okay.

309
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,700
I can wait.

310
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,040
Please go upstairs. 
You have high blood pressure.

311
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,510
Eems hyung, you have
 high blood pressure?

312
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,440
Well, I'm not sure.

313
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,250
Yeah.

314
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,330
I noticed that you have slightly 
high blood pressure last time.

315
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,260
That's what the hospital said, right?

316
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,870
Oh, yeah, yeah.

317
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,970
Let's go upstairs.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,790
Okay.

319
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,160
Okay, now, now.

320
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,650
Let's all go to our rooms. Go, go!

321
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,990
- Let's go.
- Get some rest.

322
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,880
Goodnight, Noonim.

323
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,640
What's wrong with him?

324
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,240
Wow, he's a real player.

325
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,460
Auntie, don't listen to him.

326
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,010
- He's really bad.
- I heard.

327
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,710
I heard everything he said.

328
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,600
 You have high blood pressure. 

329
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,200
What's wrong?

330
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,980
I thought I heard someone's 
voice all of a sudden.

331
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,720
A voice?

332
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,760
"You have a high blood pressure."

333
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,620
I feel like someone had
 said that to me.

334
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,980
 Geez, it was Mom. 

335
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,680
I see. That's a really good sign.

336
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,870
When it comes to amnesia,

337
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,540
all the scenes that were gathered 
internally throughout one's life

338
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,860
comes back as you 
recover your memory.

339
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,240
Our human brain is so mysterious 
more you get to know about it.

340
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,930
Aigoo. That'd be great if 
that were the case.

341
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,380
Yeah, that's right.

342
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,280
For now, let's go upstairs.

343
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,460
Okay.

344
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,930
Let's go.

345
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,600
My gosh. Chae Woon,
 it's cold. Put this on.

346
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,530
Mom, it's okay.

347
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,220
We're almost home.

348
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,320
My goodness.

349
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,990
Mom.

350
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,930
In any case, give me some time.

351
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,680
I'll look into it to see what went on.

352
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,330
- And after that...
- No need to look into it.

353
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,800
Let's go see CEO tomorrow...

354
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,090
Mom.

355
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,430
- For now...
- Ms. Lee!

356
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,270
Mr. Woo.

357
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,220
Why are you out here?

358
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,830
I was worried.

359
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,700
How did everything go...

360
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,320
Well, it was nothing serious.

361
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,500
We worried you, huh? I'm sorry.

362
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,730
Aigoo, no worries.

363
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,870
Geez, it's hot.

364
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,410
Why is it so hot?

365
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,150
- It's okay.
- Hang on to this.

366
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,620
I'm okay, though...

367
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,900
Let's go inside. It's cold out.

368
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,030
All right.

369
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,630
Let's go.

370
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,300
Mr. Woo, get some rest now.

371
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,010
Yes, Ms. Lee. Get some rest.

372
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,450
Goodnight, Mom.

373
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,400
This jacket...

374
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,300
Keep it on until you warm up.

375
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,100
Thanks.

376
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,150
Goodnight.

377
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,230
The fall sky is so clear. It's nice.

378
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,560
Yes.

379
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,880
Soon Jung.

380
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,800
I recently got a divorce.

381
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm completely free now.

382
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,930
Oh, my. Is that right?

383
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,380
How did that happen?

384
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,700
So...

385
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I'd like to rekindle my love

386
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,200
that I couldn't pursue a long 
time ago, Soon Jung.

387
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,800
Well...

388
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
How could he do this?

389
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,710
He just got a divorce.

390
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,580
Woo Jung Hoo!

391
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,150
Woo Jung Hoo...

392
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,710
Gosh! Woo Jung Hoo!

393
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,060
I can't move my legs.

394
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,370
Woo Jung Hoo!

395
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,400
Hey! Woo Jung Hoo!

396
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,660
Woo Jung Hoo...

397
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,360
Woo Jung...

398
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,110
Woo...

399
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,810
Gosh.

400
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,430
What?

401
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,140
Why did I have such a dream?

402
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,140
Jung Min Jae.

403
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,590
Did something happen
 to Woo Jung Hoo?

404
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,700
No...

405
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,500
No!

406
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,800
Do you hear something?

407
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,930
No, no!

408
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,670
Father!

409
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,630
Eems hyung! Eems hyung!

410
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,910
Eems hyung!

411
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,470
You're covered in sweat.

412
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,730
Aigoo!

413
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,690
You must've had a nightmare.

414
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,090
Did you have a dream? 
What was it about?

415
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,630
Did the creditors chase you?

416
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,140
Yes, speak.

417
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
Geez...

418
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,500
some woman...

419
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,180
was eating a cookie...

420
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,530
and she must've choked on it.

421
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,260
She was choking like this...

422
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,200
and died.

423
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,860
What the heck?

424
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,340
She was choking like this...

425
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,950
and just died?

426
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,030
- Yeah...
- What's this?

427
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,120
 
 This early in the morning?

428
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,750
Hi, Mom. Is something wrong?

429
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,560
Did I wake you up?

430
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,210
No, I was awake. What's up?

431
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,050
Well, it's nothing, but...

432
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,080
well...

433
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,660
you know...

434
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,240
I was wondering if something 
was up with your father.

435
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,420
Why?

436
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,110
He just appeared in my dream.

437
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,590
You, too?

438
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,860
You, too?

439
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,840
No, no...

440
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,050
Father is fine. Don't worry.

441
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,420
 All right. I'm relieved. 

442
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,290
When your father gets sick,

443
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,760
he always appears in my dream.

444
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,800
I got so anxious out of the blue.

445
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,050
I couldn't stand it.

446
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,410
 She's right on the money. 

447
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,240
Father is fine, so don't worry.

448
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,030
Go back to sleep.

449
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,150
Geez, I stopped taking 
a dump in the middle,

450
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,110
and my stomach is rumbling now.

451
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,850
 Father! 

452
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,250
Why does he keep 
calling him "father"?

453
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,680
 Do you want to meet 
your birth mom? 

454
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,750
 Ms. Kim Jung Won. 

455
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,740
 You must've looked for her all over... 

456
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,150
 Because I can't find her even if 
I looked everywhere. 

457
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,720
 She doesn't... 

458
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,920
 exist in this world anymore. 

459
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,350
I shouldn't have brought that up.

460
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,100
Bit Chae Woon, good morning.

461
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,700
Why are you going in so early?

462
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,110
Huh?

463
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,530
I had some work to do...

464
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,190
Thank you. I'll take a stroll.

465
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,500
I'll go with you, Bit Chae Won.

466
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,950
After I left your house yesterday,

467
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,290
did your family badmouth me?

468
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,440
That I barged into your house 
unannounced as your boss.

469
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,630
No.

470
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,840
You're coming into work early.

471
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,340
Yeah, there's an executives' 
meeting in the morning.

472
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,640
We have an important 
matter to discuss today.

473
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,950
The CEO position...

474
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,450
may look pompous 
on the surface,

475
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,840
but there's lots of work to do.

476
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,070
 This person is my mom? 

477
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,900
Nonsense.

478
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,310
What?

479
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:17,827
No, it's nothing.

480
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:20,917
Are you feeling all right, 
Bit Chae Woon?

481
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:25,497
Did you have breakfast?

482
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:29,127
There's no way Soon Jung
 wouldn't have fed you.

483
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:36,537
I'm sorry. I'll get going first. 
I'm sorry.

484
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:38,367
Bit Chae Woon.

485
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,397
- Unni.
- What?

486
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,967
Unni, something's up, right?

487
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:49,467
Something's up since yesterday. 
You're leaving early, too.

488
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:52,797
I told you I have to go out
 early this morning.

489
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,897
Go inside.

490
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:56,377
No, I'm sure something's up.

491
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:59,067
You've been this way ever since 
Jung Won unni stopped by. Right?

492
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,477
What is it?

493
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:03,367
Don't try to carry the burden alone.

494
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:10,357
Gosh. No, it's not like that.

495
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:12,697
I'll be late.

496
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,317
Unni.

497
00:35:18,207 --> 00:35:20,407
Geez, seriously.

498
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:22,797
I'm sure something is up.

499
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,397
My sister...

500
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:29,397
Bit Chae, and Jung Won unni.

501
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:31,597
Something is up among
 these three people.

502
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:34,347
- Right?
- Scared me! Gosh...

503
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:36,097
I felt that, too.

504
00:35:36,097 --> 00:35:42,567
I feel like some unusual energy
 is surrounding this Samgwang Villa.

505
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,637
- Stop.
- Stop, why? What?

506
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,957
A long time ago...

507
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,087
I think...

508
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:53,897
Jung Won unni had a daughter.

509
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:55,997
 A daughter? 

510
00:35:57,177 --> 00:36:01,617
 So Jung Won noonim 
had a daughter? 

511
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,067
Jung Won unni remarried.

512
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,907
She had a daughter in
 her first marriage,

513
00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:10,817
but I think she lost that daughter.

514
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,467
 I wonder if she ever found her. 

515
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,777
 She lost her daughter? Why? 

516
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:16,637
 How? Why? 

517
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,627
I wouldn't know that.

518
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:21,837
But whether that was
 Jung Won unni

519
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:25,137
or someone else.
 I'm confused about that.

520
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,417
Whoa...

521
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:35,707
What are you doing right now?

522
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:38,497
I know. What am I doing...

523
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:40,897
Aren't you too close?

524
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,407
I am close.

525
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:44,447
Shouldn't you back off a bit?

526
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:45,637
Step back.

527
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,327
- I should.
- But you aren't.

528
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:56,047
Talk about being too close.

529
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,097
Gosh.

530
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:03,247
CEO Kim Jung Won
 lost her daughter?

531
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:14,187
Gosh, no.

532
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:17,317
Even if she lost her daughter, 
I'm sure she's older than me.

533
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:23,597
What if they registered
 my birth late?

534
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:28,787
Yeah. They could've registered 
after I got to the orphanage.

535
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:32,797
No wonder.

536
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:36,097
I always thought I was more 
mature than my friends.

537
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:43,167
We look alike.

538
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:46,437
What do I do?

539
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:48,057
We look so much alike.

540
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:50,697
It must be true.

541
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:35,487
 Jang Seo Ah. 

542
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:39,887
 I was always so envious of you. 

543
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:44,297
 Seo Ah is my daughter 

544
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:45,747
 whom I love the most. 

545
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:47,757
 Don't you know that 
your actions like these  

546
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,557
 are hurting my Seo Ah? 

547
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:57,377
 Are you okay? Did you get hurt? 

548
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,947
 - Let me see.
- Are you okay? 

549
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:00,617
 Gosh! 

550
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:04,817
 So, is that why you got 
along so well with my mom? 

551
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:07,537
 Don't even dream of it. 

552
00:39:07,537 --> 00:39:10,867
 I will never let you 
take away my mom. 

553
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,097
Do you have something 
for me to do?

554
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,407
No.

555
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:15,867
You can go.

556
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:27,037
Geez. My neck.

557
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:31,857
I sleep on the floor every night, 
yet I can't get used to it.

558
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:35,297
I can't change the habit.

559
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:36,657
Geez.

560
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:41,377
I don't know what's going on, but

561
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:43,887
open up your heart like this.

562
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:47,017
If it stays like that, 
you'll get stiff like me.

563
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,847
Okay, hold your hands 
behind your back like this.

564
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:51,907
Stretch out like this 
every once in a while.

565
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,767
Like this, hold your foot...

566
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,597
You know this, right?

567
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,047
Was it this?

568
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,577
Stretch.

569
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:02,357
Aigoo, it's not easy.

570
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:14,237
Like this?

571
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:17,207
Yes.

572
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:24,417
It does feel good.

573
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,187
Thanks.

574
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:43,707
 Good news. Pil Hong hyung's 
release has been postponed. 

575
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,537
 Per your order, Cheol Goo 
picked a fight with him 

576
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:48,067
 and is heade to 
solitary confinement. 

577
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:50,457
Let me go!

578
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:53,767
Let me out!

579
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:58,307
Let me out!

580
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:02,737
I put out the fire for now...

581
00:41:14,697 --> 00:41:16,397
 Mom, wait. 

582
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:23,997
 Hae Deun, how is Mom doing? 

583
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:26,017
 Does she seem sick? 

584
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:34,497
 Unni, what happened? 
You left without eating breakfast. 

585
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:36,147
 How is Mom? 

586
00:41:39,257 --> 00:41:42,687
 Mom left early, too. 
To Hannamdong today. 

587
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,487
 

588
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:52,917
 Chae Woon. 

589
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:54,357
 Are you all right? 

590
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:56,947
 You left without eating breakfast. 

591
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,607
 Mom, where are you right now? 

592
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:01,697
Mom.

593
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:03,447
 I have to work. 

594
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:04,727
 Let's hang up. 

595
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:11,797
 Let's go see CEO tomorrow... 

596
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:29,167
 

597
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:43,097
 

598
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:56,847
Mother!

599
00:42:58,177 --> 00:42:59,997
What brings you here?

600
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:01,257
Na Ro.

601
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:04,297
Are you here to see 
Bit Chae Woon?

602
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:07,297
No.

603
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:10,057
To see CEO Kim Jung Won.

604
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:12,847
Oh, CEO?

605
00:43:13,697 --> 00:43:16,557
You two were friends in the past.

606
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:20,187
But what should I do? 
CEO is out of the office.

607
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:22,627
Really?

608
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:25,397
Yes. I think she's out of 
the office all day today.

609
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:28,027
Mom!

610
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:30,427
- Chae Woon.
- Chae Woon...

611
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:32,517
I stepped out for a moment 
and saw Mother...

612
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:34,567
Hey, Chae Woon...

613
00:43:43,627 --> 00:43:46,007
Why did you leave so
 early this morning?

614
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:47,107
You didn't even eat.

615
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:49,617
Are you here to say that
 to the CEO, Mom?

616
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:54,067
Yeah.

617
00:43:55,977 --> 00:43:58,397
I asked you to wait.

618
00:43:59,257 --> 00:44:01,597
To give me some time 
to gather myself.

619
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:05,117
It's not too late to gather yourself 
after revealing everything.

620
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:08,587
I came here without 
an appointment today,

621
00:44:08,587 --> 00:44:11,077
- but next time...
- Mom, aren't you too selfish?

622
00:44:13,177 --> 00:44:14,707
You're doing this...

623
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:18,997
to clear your guilty conscience
 as quickly as you can.

624
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:21,817
"That's right!

625
00:44:21,817 --> 00:44:23,777
Since this happened already,

626
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:28,447
let's wrap up this painful situation 
and send off Chae Woon."

627
00:44:31,827 --> 00:44:33,377
That's right.

628
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:35,787
I am selfish.

629
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:37,937
- Didn't you know?
- Mom.

630
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:39,447
As you said,

631
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:43,127
no matter how busy I was 
trying to make a living,

632
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:45,137
had I been determined,

633
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:48,157
I could've sent you back already.

634
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:49,687
But!

635
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,307
It was too tough for me alone.

636
00:44:52,307 --> 00:44:53,817
I was all by myself,

637
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:57,337
and I wasn't educated and didn't 
know how to do anything.

638
00:44:57,337 --> 00:45:00,797
I didn't know how I can

639
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:03,147
raise you, Ra Hoon, and Hae Deun.

640
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:05,907
On top of that, Ra Hoon 
got sick all the time.

641
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:09,357
I had to run to the hospital 
with him every other week.

642
00:45:09,357 --> 00:45:11,687
And without you, how can I...

643
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:14,267
- How can I!
- Mom, what's wrong with you?

644
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:17,457
Why are you saying that to me?

645
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:20,667
Why are you saying stuff
 you don't mean?

646
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:24,267
If you had tried to 
take advantage of me,

647
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:26,267
then...

648
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:30,467
you would've found my birth mom 
early on and get some money.

649
00:45:30,467 --> 00:45:32,977
Would you have wasted
 your precious youth

650
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:36,187
struggling to death 
and live like a fool?

651
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:39,397
That's what I'm saying! 
My precious youth...

652
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:42,657
was ruined because of you. 
What a waste that was.

653
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:46,187
I'll use you now to get 
something out of it even now.

654
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:50,507
Once we move out of the villa soon, 
we'll be living on the streets.

655
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:53,127
I have to pay for 
my Ra Hoon's schooling.

656
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:55,937
Hae Deun still can't seem
 to take care of herself.

657
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:58,117
I'd like to get something out of you.

658
00:45:58,117 --> 00:45:59,817
I want to live out my latter days

659
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:02,417
in peace comfortably,
 thanks to you. So what!

660
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:03,997
Mom!

661
00:46:10,057 --> 00:46:11,937
Get back to work!

662
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,667
Don't you dare meet the 
CEO without my permission.

663
00:46:19,637 --> 00:46:21,467
I'll never see you again if you do.

664
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:24,517
You won't get anything out of me.

665
00:46:28,347 --> 00:46:29,867
Really?

666
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:32,497
That can't be.

667
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:36,547
I must get something out 
of my Chae Woon.

668
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:42,907
Mom...

669
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:45,897
Mom...

670
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:48,787
Mom!

671
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:41,197
Here is Woo Jung Hoo's phone.

672
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:42,737
Here you go.

673
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:45,397
Please sign here.

674
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:46,997
- Thank you.
- Sure.

675
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:55,367
Dae Won, I'm sorry.

676
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:57,487
My mom stopped by 
out of the blue.

677
00:47:57,487 --> 00:48:00,037
I'm about to leave for the store.

678
00:48:00,037 --> 00:48:02,467
Yes, I'll start at the 
Cheongdamdong store.

679
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:05,007
Yes, have a good day.

680
00:48:08,807 --> 00:48:12,037
 

681
00:48:24,357 --> 00:48:26,537
 

682
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,287
  The customer can't answer
 the call right now. 

683
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:30,087
  You'll be connected 
to the voicemail. 

684
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,247
Bit Chae Woon isn't 
answering her phone.

685
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:33,987
I'm worried.

686
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:45,077
This is Mom's number.

687
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:47,887
Hi, Mom.

688
00:48:49,737 --> 00:48:52,217
Why are you answering 
your dad's phone?

689
00:48:52,217 --> 00:48:53,407
Huh?

690
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,297
I'm with Father right now.

691
00:48:57,317 --> 00:48:59,457
He went to the restroom.

692
00:48:59,457 --> 00:49:00,747
What's going on?

693
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:04,367
I can't believe you're
 meeting your dad.

694
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:07,797
 You know how I told you 
I had a dream about your dad? 

695
00:49:07,797 --> 00:49:11,147
I felt uneasy, so 
I wanted to call him.

696
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:14,357
Father is doing well.

697
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:17,837
Should I put him on when
 he's back from the restroom?

698
00:49:17,837 --> 00:49:19,337
No, no, no.

699
00:49:19,337 --> 00:49:21,657
It's fine since he's doing well.

700
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:25,297
Don't tell him I called and delete 
my call from call history.

701
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:26,507
Okay?

702
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:27,887
Your dad will say,

703
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,497
"Jung Min Jae, I knew it."

704
00:49:31,397 --> 00:49:33,197
I don't want him to be satisfied.

705
00:49:33,297 --> 00:49:35,057
Okay, bye, Mom.

706
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:38,007
Geez.

707
00:49:39,437 --> 00:49:41,037
I'm sorry, Mom.

708
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,387
Jae Hee, did you wait long?

709
00:49:46,387 --> 00:49:47,877
Hello, Chief.

710
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:51,757
President is staying with you?

711
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:55,787
He's not sick or anything, is he?

712
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,677
He just wants to take a break.

713
00:49:58,677 --> 00:50:01,537
In the meantime, if you 
tell me any critical issues

714
00:50:01,537 --> 00:50:04,767
relevant to work, then I'll tell Father.

715
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:07,057
Okay...

716
00:50:07,947 --> 00:50:12,337
And don't tell my uncle 
about this for now.

717
00:50:12,337 --> 00:50:15,327
If Uncle finds out, 
my mom will find out, too.

718
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:17,507
Everyone will worry.

719
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:20,007
Sure, will do.

720
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:26,387
What's this?

721
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:29,467
What are they doing,
 leaving me out of it?

722
00:50:51,857 --> 00:50:53,857
Eems hyung, what are you doing?

723
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:56,307
Aigoo, seriously. What a waste!

724
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,597
What are you doing right now? 
You just ate lunch.

725
00:51:00,597 --> 00:51:01,987
Why are you eating again?

726
00:51:01,987 --> 00:51:04,247
Well, um...

727
00:51:04,247 --> 00:51:06,407
I got hungry again.

728
00:51:07,387 --> 00:51:09,897
Again? You ate so much earlier.

729
00:51:10,877 --> 00:51:13,287
I'm hungry again.

730
00:51:16,357 --> 00:51:18,047
Weren't you hungry?

731
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:19,617
Whoa.

732
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:21,657
Thank you, ahjussi.

733
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:31,347
Gosh.

734
00:51:31,347 --> 00:51:32,967
Eat slowly.

735
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:35,177
- Drink water, too.
- Okay.

736
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:47,617
Aren't your parents worried?

737
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:49,847
My mother passed away,

738
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:52,487
and my father lives in Sokcho...

739
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:55,727
Well, he's a bit sick.

740
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,497
I see.

741
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:02,957
How did your mother die?

742
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:04,767
While giving birth to me.

743
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:12,297
I know since I've lived in hiding.

744
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:16,797
Hiding out like this must be tough.

745
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:19,067
Yes.

746
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:21,657
What's the worst part?

747
00:52:21,657 --> 00:52:23,067
Going to the bathroom.

748
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:25,677
The ladies' room is 
on the first floor, too.

749
00:52:25,677 --> 00:52:28,047
That's true.

750
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:32,737
Should I bring her a chamber pot?

751
00:52:32,737 --> 00:52:34,577
What is that?

752
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:37,817
You don't know what 
a chamber pot is?

753
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:40,097
A chamber pot is for...

754
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:45,087
You said no one was home.

755
00:52:48,117 --> 00:52:50,087
No one is home. Everyone is out.

756
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,547
I left the second-floor window open. 
It must be the wind.

757
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:55,267
Oh, I see.

758
00:52:55,267 --> 00:52:56,607
Eat slowly.

759
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,057
It's so delicious.

760
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:04,027
Ahjussi...

761
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:10,237
Hey, Cha Ba Reun.

762
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:13,367
What's with you? Why? 
Why are you here?

763
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:19,097
I thought I locked the
 door for sure.

764
00:53:22,147 --> 00:53:24,507
How did you know 
this is my house?

765
00:53:26,217 --> 00:53:28,507
Did you follow me again?

766
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:31,657
Whoa, you...

767
00:53:36,957 --> 00:53:39,137
Hey, are you Kim Joon Woo?

768
00:53:43,927 --> 00:53:45,677
Hae Deun, you're here.

769
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:47,557
- Please take this order.
- Okay.

770
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,637
Welcome.

771
00:53:48,637 --> 00:53:50,577
One meatball sandwich,

772
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:52,967
- and warm it up, please.
- Got it.

773
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:01,417
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

774
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:07,017
 I think... 

775
00:54:07,017 --> 00:54:09,947
 Jung Won unni had a daughter. 

776
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:12,977
I'm sure of it.

777
00:54:12,977 --> 00:54:15,187
I must be her long-lost daughter.

778
00:54:19,197 --> 00:54:22,237
You're my daughter?

779
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:24,877
Yes, Mom.

780
00:54:26,337 --> 00:54:27,687
No wonder.

781
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:31,097
I felt that something drew me 
to you from the get-go.

782
00:54:31,117 --> 00:54:32,607
Me, too.

783
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:36,657
- Hae Deun.
- Mom!

784
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:41,607
Gosh, what a lovely house.

785
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:43,487
Mom, I love you!

786
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:49,807
Ring me up?

787
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:52,697
Oh, yes. I'm sorry, Mom.

788
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:54,087
Mom?

789
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:56,817
I'm sorry.

790
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:15,247
Come to your senses, 
Bit Chae Woon.

791
00:55:19,527 --> 00:55:21,627
I think this will look better.

792
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:22,927
Okay, CEO.

793
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:24,527
Bit Chae Woon.

794
00:55:26,937 --> 00:55:29,417
Did you come to check
 on the store?

795
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:30,967
Yes.

796
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:32,667
You're working hard.

797
00:55:34,127 --> 00:55:35,797
Bit Chae Woon.

798
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:38,857
Shall we...

799
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:42,777
play hooky?

800
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:48,157
CEO left with Bit Chae Woon?

801
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:50,227
Where did they go?

802
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:52,197
 I'm not sure where. 

803
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:54,147
 She drove herself. 

804
00:55:54,147 --> 00:55:56,567
She even drove?

805
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,077
All right.

806
00:56:00,077 --> 00:56:04,517
Continue to report to me 
CEO's whereabouts.

807
00:56:16,497 --> 00:56:19,197
What a nice day, isn't it?

808
00:56:19,997 --> 00:56:22,747
Where should we go?

809
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:25,387
Do you want to go 
anywhere in particular?

810
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:36,957
By chance, is something wrong?

811
00:56:36,957 --> 00:56:38,207
What?

812
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:42,857
You look somewhat lonely.

813
00:56:45,977 --> 00:56:47,697
Do I look that way?

814
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:54,557
Yesterday out of the blue,

815
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:58,827
I thought of someone
 from my past.

816
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:02,027
That aftermath...

817
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:04,597
is still lingering.

818
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:07,397
Someone from the past?

819
00:57:08,097 --> 00:57:09,197
Yeah.

820
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,967
Should we go see her?

821
00:57:39,587 --> 00:57:41,597
How have you been?

822
00:57:43,357 --> 00:57:45,877
It's been too long, huh?

823
00:57:45,877 --> 00:57:47,697
I'm sorry.

824
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:56,837
Seo Yeon...

825
00:57:57,497 --> 00:57:59,687
 
My daughter...

826
00:58:00,337 --> 00:58:02,717
who left me a long time ago.

827
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,347
Your daughter...

828
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:18,507
She's in a wonderful place now.

829
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:25,547
Seo Yeon.

830
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:28,097
This is...

831
00:58:31,197 --> 00:58:32,997
Bit Chae Woon.

832
00:58:33,897 --> 00:58:36,547
Are you all right? 
Are you feeling sick?

833
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:38,997
I'll...

834
00:58:39,017 --> 00:58:41,607
- I'll be outside.
- Let's go together.

835
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:43,687
No, it's okay.

836
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,837
I'm dead?

837
00:59:08,497 --> 00:59:09,977
I'm...

838
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,707
no longer in this world?

839
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:20,217
How could this be?

840
00:59:24,157 --> 00:59:25,837
How could this be?

841
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:29,807
How could this be?

842
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,307
How could this be?

843
00:59:32,147 --> 00:59:34,277
How could this happen to me?

844
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:54,397
How could this happen to me...

845
01:00:20,357 --> 01:00:22,107
Bit Chae Woon.

846
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,887
Are you all right?

847
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,167
Yes.

848
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,397
I'm sorry.

849
01:00:28,397 --> 01:00:31,147
No, I'm sorry.

850
01:00:31,147 --> 01:00:34,467
For bringing you to a place
 like this out of the blue.

851
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:37,507
Were you taken aback?

852
01:00:38,887 --> 01:00:42,947
I didn't want to come alone,
 so I brought you with me.

853
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:45,517
I guess I was shortsighted.

854
01:00:48,837 --> 01:00:50,677
It's strange.

855
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:56,477
Why did I want to come
 here with you?

856
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:02,377
What's wrong with me?

857
01:01:06,827 --> 01:01:10,447
How did your daughter pass away?

858
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:18,817
It's something...

859
01:01:19,857 --> 01:01:22,857
I've never told anyone.

860
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,197
Back then, someone...

861
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:30,647
took...

862
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,297
my Seo Yeon...

863
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:39,187
Seo Yeon was stolen.

864
01:01:42,707 --> 01:01:44,277
Stole her?

865
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:47,567
Who?

866
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:57,337
 No way. 

867
01:01:57,337 --> 01:01:59,237
 Did Mom? 

868
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:02,807
So...

869
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:06,927
I think that's how...

870
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:10,867
my baby died.

871
01:02:12,077 --> 01:02:13,927
It's all my fault.

872
01:02:13,927 --> 01:02:16,617
I couldn't protect her.

873
01:02:22,397 --> 01:02:24,097
Let's stop talking about this.

874
01:02:24,997 --> 01:02:29,027
I took away too much of 
your time, Bit Chae Woon.

875
01:02:29,027 --> 01:02:30,747
Let's go now.

876
01:02:48,507 --> 01:02:50,407
 I'm dead. 

877
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:53,307
 I never existed to begin with. 

878
01:02:53,997 --> 01:02:55,297
 Why? 

879
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:57,047
 Someone... 

880
01:02:59,077 --> 01:03:00,977
 stole Seo Yeon. 

881
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:03,797
 Did Mom? 

882
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,097
 There's no way. 

883
01:03:08,137 --> 01:03:09,887
 There's no way. 

884
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:21,237
 

885
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:25,927
  The customer can't answer
 the call right now. 

886
01:03:34,187 --> 01:03:37,057
 

887
01:03:49,277 --> 01:03:51,187
 

888
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:57,717
Hello? Bit Chae Woon?

889
01:03:57,717 --> 01:04:00,727
 How come I can't reach you?
 I was worried. 

890
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:02,337
 Are you listening? 

891
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:04,237
 Hello? Bit Chae Woon? 

892
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,677
Yes.

893
01:04:09,797 --> 01:04:14,187
Well, can you come over?
 I'm at a construction site.

894
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:16,977
Geez, something came 
up again. Hurry over.

895
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:20,247
 You're desperately needed here. 

896
01:04:21,407 --> 01:04:23,787
 You can't come? 
Then I'll pick you up. 

897
01:04:23,787 --> 01:04:26,197
Where are you? 
At your work? Where?

898
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:28,787
 - Koala. 
- Yes?

899
01:04:32,697 --> 01:04:35,267
Could you come over here?

900
01:04:38,717 --> 01:04:40,407
Where are you?

901
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:42,977
Where are you?

902
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:09,797
Bit Chae Woon.

903
01:06:15,787 --> 01:06:18,797
Don't be so self-conscious
 crying like that.

904
01:06:18,797 --> 01:06:20,827
I'm not crying.

905
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:51,577
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

906
01:06:51,577 --> 01:06:59,707
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

907
01:06:59,707 --> 01:07:06,057
♫  We're drawn to each other
 like the magnets  ♫

908
01:07:06,057 --> 01:07:12,247
♫  So that we can fill 
in a hole in our heart  ♫

909
01:07:12,247 --> 01:07:14,017
Cry now.

910
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:17,367
As much as you want.

911
01:07:20,277 --> 01:07:26,097
♫  When I see you, I can smile  ♫

912
01:07:26,097 --> 01:07:34,097
♫  You became a place to 
rest after a hard day  ♫

913
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:41,627
♫  The rain called you is 
making me wet  ♫

914
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:47,697
♫  I got soaked in
 an unexpected love  ♫

915
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:51,277
♫  In my meaningless life  ♫

916
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:54,867
♫  You became the meaning  ♫

917
01:07:54,867 --> 01:08:01,247
♫  The one who taught me love  ♫

918
01:08:01,247 --> 01:08:06,287
♫  Is you  ♫

919
01:08:09,497 --> 01:08:15,677
♫  We were very different  ♫

920
01:08:15,677 --> 01:08:23,947
♫  So we could fit the 
puzzle called life  ♫

921
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:36,277
♫  When I see you, I can smile  ♫

922
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:39,307
 

923
01:08:39,307 --> 01:08:42,447
 Mother, do you want to go over to 
Jae Hee oppa's place after work? 

924
01:08:42,447 --> 01:08:43,827
 - To Jae Hee's?
- Yes. 

925
01:08:43,827 --> 01:08:46,147
 Father? Father! 

926
01:08:46,147 --> 01:08:48,527
 Woo Jung Hoo? Jae Hee's dad! 

927
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:50,897
 I called you several times
 because I was worried. 

928
01:08:50,897 --> 01:08:52,677
 What were you worried about? 

929
01:08:52,697 --> 01:08:55,397
 Because I like you, 
Bit Chae Woon. 

930
01:08:55,447 --> 01:08:58,247
 Bit Chae Woon wishes 
to resign all of a sudden. 

931
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:00,287
 Chae Woon, what is it 
that I'm hearing? 

932
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,697
 Why are you quitting your job? 

933
01:09:01,697 --> 01:09:04,467
 Did you know that
 I'm supposedly dead? 

934
01:09:04,467 --> 01:09:07,067
 Your daughter, Seo Yeon... 

935
01:09:07,067 --> 01:09:08,747
 She's alive. 

936
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:14,397
♫  Like passing time, 
I can't stop you  ♫
