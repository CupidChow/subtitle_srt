1
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,850
Director Jang, why don't you go home first-- 
      

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,140
Is there something going on?

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,750
- Mom. 
 - Yes.

4
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,750
Who's baby... is this?

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:43,590
You were the one... who had this photo?

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,720
Who's baby is this?

7
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,890
Director, can I go to the reference room...

8
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,550
Someone gave this to me.

9
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,750
Who?

10
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,630
A person that I know.

11
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,630
Your friend?

12
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,670
Is it Mrs. Min Jae?

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,830
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,950
I found this in your office a while ago, but I forgot to give it back to you.

15
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,890
But then, why are you giving this to me now?

16
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,130
I found this when I was cleaning out my drawer and got curious all of a sudden.

17
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,140
It's not from Min Jae.

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,100
But a friend that I knew for a long time gave this to me.

19
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,220
You still have work to do, right?

20
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,930
I'll go home first. Good luck with your work.

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,000
It's strange.

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,960
Why didn't Seo Ah say anything when she had this photo?

23
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,910
  Of course, it's not easy, since I just closed the door of the half a century length of history.  

24
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,750
  But I'll cheer up for myself. I hope you can help me with that.  

25
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,850
  Yes, thank you so much! Have a good night!  

26
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,960
Oh? Mr. Woo!

27
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,850
You're coming home late tonight again!

28
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,050
You're working hard, Hyungnim.

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,510
Aren't you hungry? Have some jokbal before you go home.

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,050
  - You guys are coming home now!   
 - Uncle!

31
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,190
Is it okay to be that loud at night?

32
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,430
Thank you for the food, Hyungnim!

33
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,240
We are not in a study room!

34
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,090
Chae Woon! You should have some jokbal as well. Na Ro should come, too.

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,700
- We already ate some late-night snacks... 
 - You're still young, so you can eat more food! I'll give it out for free.

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,350
We'll have it next time. Let's go.

37
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,420
It smells amazing! Shall we have a little bite before going home?

38
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,250
Are we eating again?

39
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,850
This is the best-selling menu in our place!

40
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,850
And then, bang!

41
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,500
Thank you for the food!

42
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,700
- Wow, Chae Woon! Try this first. 
 - Thank you.

43
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,530
Wow, this looks really good!

44
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,610
- It's good, right? 
 - It's amazing.

45
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,320
I had this in a lot of different places, but this place is the best.

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,950
So, do you drink?

47
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,250
People who can't drink always does that.

48
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,250
Mm! I like this one better!

49
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,550
You're going to lend your room to that boy? Then where are you going to stay?

50
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,350
I can share a room with unni! Or maybe with auntie Man Jung.

51
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,040
Are you?

52
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,030
You even didn't like Ra Hoon using the attic, so you went on a hunger strike.

53
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:04,660
I was immature back then. Instead, lend me half of the boy's rent.

54
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,250
Why? Are you going to get some cosmetic treatment again?

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,250
No! Since I'm a trainee and not making any money, I need some pocket money.

56
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,150
I'll just give you some money!

57
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,350
No, I also want to contribute to our family and spend my allowance.

58
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,220
- I'm home! 
 - Oh, welcome.

59
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,410
Are you having a family meeting?

60
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,650
If it's uncomfortable for you, I'll share the room with auntie Man Jung.

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,050
Yes, noona. That's probably better.

62
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,750
Share my room.

63
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,000
Unni...

64
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,650
Thank you so much, unni!

65
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,620
- Go, go. 
 - Hey, let's go and move my stuff before she changes her mind! Thank you, unni!

66
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,050
Hurry up, hurry up!

67
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,150
Chae Woon, would that be okay?

68
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:12,720
What can I do? I'm proud of her even thinking about that.

69
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,150
Maybe Lee Hae Deun got mature?

70
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,560
Hey, Lee Hae Deun. Are you really going to be okay?

71
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,530
You said you'll never going to share a room with the oldest noona because she keeps nagging on you.

72
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,150
That's not an issue right now!

73
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,340
If I'm going to go in as a trainee in that new company, then I don't have any income, so I need money.

74
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,750
Don't you have any money that you saved? It would've been nice if you could've saved some to use at times like this!

75
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,150
I do have some! But that's--

76
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,760
Never mind. It happens to be like that. I'm regretting it!

77
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,200
You really should.

78
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,750
Hey, be careful not to drop anything.

79
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,100
Hey! You should carry this together! How can you just take one little thing! Hey!

80
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:19,150
I should get like a chamber pot or something. Why is the women's bathroom is only on the first floor?

81
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,250
What was that? Hwak Se!

82
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,850
You didn't go to work until now? You should go get that money!

83
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,030
Right? What is he doing?

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,420
Why did he lock the door? Why did you lock the door, Hwak Se?

85
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,660
Wait, what are you doing? Hey! What are you doing in there!

86
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,400
What are you doing by yourself? Open the door! Open the door!

87
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,910
You're asking me to do this, right? Open the door! Open the door!

88
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,340
Are you eating something good by yourself? Open the door!

89
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,350
Open the door! My goodness, open it!

90
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,650
Man Jung! What are you doing here?

91
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:05,150
Unni, Hwak Se is in there by himself but not opening the door. I think he's eating something. Open it! Open the door!

92
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:12,450
- I mean, he went out for work, that's why his door is locked. 
 - He already went out?

93
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,380
But I heard this door closing.

94
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,690
Unni, is it a thief? Oh, my goodness!

95
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,650
Hey! Who are you! Open the door!

96
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,550
I mean, Hwak Se didn't go to work.

97
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,970
You should follow me. I have something to tell you.

98
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,960
You have something to tell me? I knew it. Tell me.

99
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,730
  Come, come.   Have a seat.

100
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,180
Tell me. What's going on?

101
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,290
- What? 
 - You said you have something to tell me!

102
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,370
Tell me everything. Unni, one of the kids' biological parents or somebody like that called you, right?

103
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,960
No, it's nothing like that!

104
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,920
I was a little bit depressed. Maybe it's because of the season.

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,360
I just went to my husband's grave. Also, to have some fresh air as well.

106
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,510
  Is that all?  

107
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,960
I guess my mom was having a hard time.

108
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,170
Mr. Woo Jae Hee!

109
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,830
Are you home?

110
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,410
Did I hear it wrong?

111
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,980
Take a good look at me.

112
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,500
You saw it, right?

113
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,710
You just drank a drop.

114
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,100
That's laughable.

115
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,220
Take a good look.

116
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,870
Did you see that?

117
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,550
Why are they trying to do a competition when they both can't drink that well?

118
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,850
That's cute. That's very cute.

119
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,250
Mr. Woo Jae Hee.

120
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,950
I have a burning question to ask you.

121
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,290
What? The secret skill of a pig wrestling?

122
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,450
It's all about the leg... I'm not going to tell you the answer!

123
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,260
I'm not talking about that!

124
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,150
Woo Jae Hee, you,

125
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,650
you like Ms. Bit Chae Woon, aren't you?

126
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,780
Bit Chae Woon?!

127
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,460
You! By the way, where did the headbutt go?

128
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,710
Where did the headbutt go? Ms. Bit Chae Woon! Did you go home?

129
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,550
Did you already forget that Chae Woon said she's tired and went home first before?

130
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,050
Did she?

131
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,350
How can the headbutt ran away like that! I thought she went to the restroom.

132
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:43,150
Headbutt, Koala. You guys are calling each other with nicknames, it's ridiculous!

133
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:51,100
Tell me about it, Mr. Koala! You like the headbutt, right?

134
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,530
Are you jealous?

135
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,830
You look like a cunning penguin.

136
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,950
- What? Cunn...Cunning... 
 - A Cunning Penguin.

137
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,330
You are the one who likes our headbutt, aren't you?

138
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,230
I knew about it since when I first met you.

139
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,350
You like the headbutt, right? Tell me. Tell me!

140
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,650
Yes, I like her. What are you going to do about it?

141
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,730
My goodness, really! Na Ro, can you help me? Hurry up!

142
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,330
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,220
My goodness, what's going on? I should've not suggested this in the first place.

144
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,250
Jae Hee, wake up! Mr. Woo! My goodness...

145
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,750
I'm an idiot. I'm never going to take you guys as a customer!

146
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,480
- Ra Hoon, no! 
 - Uncle, the back of my leg fell asleep..!

147
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,650
- Meow! 
 - Don't meow at me! 
      

148
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,650
- Ra Hoon, wait there for a second. I'll be back soon. 
 - Where are you going!

149
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,150
Hey! Mr. Woo!

150
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,250
Chae Woon! Hae Deun! Noonim!

151
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,380
  Noonim! Chae Woon!  

152
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,250
- What's going on? 
 - I knew it was going to be like this!

153
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,010
Hold me! Hold me!

154
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,640
- Why did you drink that much! 
 - Where were you?

155
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,650
This is insanity!

156
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,020
Auntie, hold on to him!

157
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,920
Hey, come out!

158
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,610
Not you, aunt, but Bit Chae Woon...

159
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,150
- Let's go! 
 - Go inside, go inside. Be careful!

160
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,840
Aigo, aunt! You're very strong!

161
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,140
Lee Hae Deun, open the door! Hurry up and open now!

162
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,310
Careful! Be careful of the stairs!

163
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,080
I won! You know? I won!

164
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,150
My goodness, Hwak Se! You should've stopped them!

165
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,870
Both of them barely drank! My goodness!

166
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,700
- Oh, really! Come this way! 
 - This way, this way!

167
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,100
My god, try to put yourself together!

168
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,890
Oh my goodness, Mr. Woo, maybe you need to take some medicine.

169
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,840
- Oh, no! His neck is bending! 
 - Be careful!

170
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,110
One second, let me see. It's weird.

171
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:55,470
- Oh, god! Aigo, I don't know if I have to keep living in this house. 
 - What's going on?

172
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:02,700
Really, aunt. I don't know if I should keep living in this house. How can I live here seeing this kind of thing all the time!

173
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,250
- What are you doing! 
 - I feel a little bit comforted. You can go now, aunt.

174
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,250
- No, let me take a look at him! Get out of my way! 
 - No, aunt, it's fine!

175
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,150
- Man Jung, you should go out. 
 - Why?

176
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,150
- Just get out of here. 
 - Why? I'm a doctor! What's wrong with you guys!

177
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,550
Eems hyung! What are you doing in this room!

178
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,250
Wait, are you okay? Your face is pale!

179
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:46,450
I-I've been holding my urine... for a long time...

180
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,150
My god, it's crazy. Wait one second, wait.

181
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,950
Hwang Na Ro! This, this, this...

182
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,690
Huh?

183
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,450
It's that handsome young guy.

184
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,900
  Eems hyung, Eems hyung. Don't let go of yourself and come this way gently.  

185
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,620
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 - Why is he so heavy!

186
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,550
One second! I should take off my jacket before going to bed.

187
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,230
- Why did he drink that much? 
 - I should take off my jacket before going to bed.

188
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,600
- Hyung! Sleep on the bed! You're on the floor right now! 
 - No, I like it here.

189
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,850
- Put him back up. 
 - What is he doing?

190
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,980
By the way, Na Ro oppa's room is very clean!

191
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,870
My goodness! He's so smart!

192
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,650
- Ra Hoon, just put some blanket on him. 
 - Yes.

193
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,470
- Good night! 
 - Hey, isn't Na Ro oppa's room really neat?

194
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,250
- If he looks at your room he'll freak out. 
 - You should mind your own business!

195
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,850
Na Ro! You should sleep under the cover!

196
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,640
No, I like it this way.

197
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,880
     

198
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,650
You surprised me!

199
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,580
You weren't sleeping?

200
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,080
You were completely wasted before.

201
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,450
I usually get drunk fast and get sober fast.

202
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,680
Do you have something on your mind?

203
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,090
Is it about your mother?

204
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:01,450
My mom seems to have some trauma of divorce. Even though, she's still very energetic.

205
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,850
Mr. Koala should take care of her more, right?

206
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,290
My mom's a very strong person, just like you, headbutt.

207
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,250
- Why the headbutt comes out on-- 
 - She'll be fine.

208
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,620
Yes, she will be.

209
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,720
Because I'm like that, too. Pow! Like this.

210
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,090
- By the way. 
 - Yes?

211
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,950
Why did you throw me away earlier and went to hold on to Hwang Na Ro?

212
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,370
Because Hae Deun and Ra Hoon were struggling with him.

213
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,810
And also, you were exceptionally heavy.

214
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,490
How can you say I'm heavy? I thought you might get heavy, so I was leaning on to Hwak Se more.

215
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:52,130
What? What's this? Were you pretending to be drunk?

216
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,050
I mean I won the drinking competition. But I went like this by instinct.

217
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,680
Why do you care if I carry Hwang Na Ro on my back or hold on to him?

218
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm sleepy, I'm going to bed. Good night!

219
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,150
Hey, Mr. Koala! Don't try to get out of this!

220
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,150
See?

221
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,950
See what? You turned off the light.

222
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,870
Well, why did you turn off the light?

223
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,340
Have a good night.

224
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,050
Good night. Ouch!

225
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,080
My goodness, why are you headbutting me?

226
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,590
Good night!

227
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:01,900
♫   In the pitch-black road of mine   ♫

228
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:09,250
♫   On the day, even the hope gets shaken   ♫

229
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:16,150
♫   Like the star that's shining like a jewel in the night sky   ♫ 
 Yes!

230
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:23,050
♫   The shining day will come   ♫ 
 Wow! Fighting!

231
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:30,550
♫   A night without anyone to lean on or to talk to, I'm comforting myself   ♫ 
 I can do it!

232
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,650
♫  this tearfully lonely night  ♫

233
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:44,500
♫   Everybody looks happy except me   ♫

234
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,290
♫   Youth these days are having a hard time   ♫

235
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,250
Hwang Na Ro, what are you doing? You are slacking.

236
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,880
I should put myself together!

237
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:04,750
♫  Well, just living with that in my heart  ♫ 
 Ah, my stomach hurts!

238
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:12,750
♫  Well, just living with that in my heart  ♫

239
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,980
  Did you really check it thoroughly?  

240
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,150
How many times do I have to say this! I even went to their office.

241
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,550
- I'm going to sign the contract today. 
 - Today? Really?

242
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:31,930
- But if you get any suspicious feelings, call me right away. Okay? 
 - I got it!

243
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,440
After I sign the trainee contract today, I'm going to reveal it to all of my Samgwang family.

244
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,540
  - I bet everybody will be surprised!   
 - A contract?

245
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,250
Good morning, Hyungnim!

246
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,550
- Ah, Ra Hoon! 
 - Yes?

247
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,230
Is Hae Deun okay these days?

248
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,710
Why are you asking about her?

249
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,940
Actually, I know that Hae Deun didn't pass the first audition. I'm just pretending that I don't know about it.

250
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,290
Oh, you knew about it.

251
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,570
Hyung, actually this is a secret.

252
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:26,340
I think she's going to have a better opportunity, but it sounds a bit...

253
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,650
What is it?

254
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:37,850
So, there's something, something a bit strange...

255
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,050
Mom!

256
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,150
Yes, Hae Deun! Aren't you late for work?

257
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,600
- Mom, I have a favor to ask. 
 - What is it?

258
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,350
Today is an important day for me.

259
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,750
- Make a wish and blow it away. 
 - Yes!

260
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,900
  I hope my contract goes well today, and please make me successful!  

261
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,920
Are you not going to tell me what it's about?

262
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,750
I'll tell you if it goes well. I'm going to be late! Mom, thank you, I love you!

263
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,150
Aigo, yes! My daughter, I love you, too.

264
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,130
- Everything will be great. Okay? 
 - Yes! I'll get going.

265
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,820
James! Did you sleep well?

266
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,800
Yes. I heard from Hwak Se that everybody went out, so I came downstairs.

267
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,540
You made a good choice. Why don't you go out to the garden and walk around?

268
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,200
Yes, I will.

269
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,450
But this is...

270
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,170
It's worn-down, right? It's a very old one. 
      

271
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,750
  It's strange. Why does it look so familiar?  

272
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,150
Oh! It's the fantastical dictionary.

273
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,680
I guess somebody had to make a wish today!

274
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,550
Yes, it was Hae Deun. She said she has an important thing today.

275
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:28,950
Is that so? But why didn't she talk about that to me?

276
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,550
- She said she'll say about it if it goes well. 
 - Ah, I get it.

277
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:40,250
By the way, isn't James should blow one of the lucky flower petals to make your memories back?

278
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,790
Oh, shall we do that?

279
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,630
Okay, hyungnim. These are our noonim's magical flower petals.

280
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,850
Pick one of these flowers and blow away after making a wish, then those wishes come true.

281
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,350
Of course, sometimes it doesn't come true.

282
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,230
Is that so.

283
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:04,570
- Do you want one of these? 
 - Oh, no, it's okay.

284
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:11,090
- Why don't you try it? 
 - N-No, I'm fine. I'll be back from a walk.

285
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:23,050
My goodness, is he blushing right now? I think Eems hyung is a very good and sweet person.

286
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:32,050
By the way, Hwak Se. Shouldn't we try more actively to find James' family?

287
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:39,380
Yes, I think so, too. But it's very strange! Why isn't anybody looking for him?

288
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,230
Is there anybody home?

289
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,300
Brother-in-law!

290
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,130
He's not in here.

291
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,780
Why don't you call him?

292
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,880
He said I should never call him when he's on vacation.

293
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,150
Just call him and say there's an emergency at the company.

294
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,050
     

295
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,430
  The phone is turned off and will be connected to the voice mail.  

296
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,600
What?

297
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,450
I have no reason to contact him anymore! Why, is there something going on?

298
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:34,720
No, nothing. I thought he might be bothering you.

299
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,250
Yes, I get it, noona.

300
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,950
What was that?

301
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,440
Jae Hee's mother?

302
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,380
- Mother! 
 - Seo Ah!

303
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,050
- What brings you to be here? 
 - Your mother said that she's going to buy me a delicious lunch.

304
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,050
Mother! I missed you so much!

305
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,650
- Let's go. I didn't recognize you because you cut your hair short! 
 - I should lose some weight.

306
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,750
- You're so awesome! 
 - No, it's not like that!

307
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,190
Oh, director Jang with two faces. She's apparently her future mother-in-law.

308
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,910
Is that so?

309
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,680
A manic-depressive disorder?

310
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:24,650
- That's why you were energetic these days because you were on a manic episode? 
 - I guess so.

311
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,560
Min Jae.

312
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:32,570
Don't worry about me. I heard it's nothing serious. I told it to Jae Hee as well. He met the doctor and talked with him as well.

313
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:38,150
You did the right thing. We can get through this together.

314
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,650
- Let's do it. 
 - Yes!

315
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,160
Yes, director Jang.

316
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,940
This is the chamomile tea that you like.

317
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,650
Oh! Thank you so much, Seo Ah. You look fabulous in the office!

318
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,550
Right? I'm pretty fabulous, right, mother?

319
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,750
Aigo! Jang Seo Ah, you're being very cutesy to her! I can't tell who is your real mother!

320
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,450
- You must be jealous, Kim Jung Won! 
 - Yes!

321
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,640
Because I'm jealous, this is a present for you!

322
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,790
What is it?

323
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,870
- A launching showcase? 
 - It's our company's event!

324
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,680
You should come! I'll arrange the best seat for you.

325
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,070
Thank you! I really wanted to go to something like this!

326
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,280
Oh, right. I wanted to invite another person as well.

327
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,550
An event?

328
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,970
Yes. Soon Jung, I really want to invite you. You'll come, right?

329
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,750
Ah, young lady Jung Won, I--

330
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,620
  I'm not going to take no as an answer.  I have to go because I'm busy!

331
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,180
So, is she coming to the event?

332
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,920
Well, she sounds like she's hesitating, but she'll come since I'm inviting.

333
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,700
Min Jae, thank you that you allowed me to invite Soon Jung.

334
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,330
Why are you saying that? She's not my enemy or something.

335
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,000
You didn't like to see her before.

336
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:14,550
That's because Mr. Woo Jung Hoo was... I don't know, it's all in the past now!

337
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,900
But, don't talk about me and Mr. Woo Jung Hoo's thing to Soon Jung.

338
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,260
I want to be seen as a happy couple.

339
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,650
My goodness, Jung Min Jae.

340
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,530
- Did you understand me? 
 - I get it!

341
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,450
I promise!

342
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,150
     

343
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,340
  Is there anybody at home?  

344
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,440
- Is this all of you brought? 
 - Yes, for now.

345
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,720
- Oh, Joon Woo, welcome! 
 - Hello!

346
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,840
- The room is on the second floor, so follow me. 
 - Yes.

347
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:17,550
  Mom, our company is having an event, and I'm inviting you. Daughter chance! 
    

348
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:32,230
  I had been a little bit depressed these days. Maybe it's because of the weather.  

349
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,670
Mom, I hope you can refresh yourself with this event!

350
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,960
Ms. Bit Chae Woon!

351
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,990
Please take a look at what I checked.

352
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,650
Did you already finish it? Wow!

353
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,240
Ah! How is your back?

354
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,400
I saw yesterday that you were curled up and sleeping on the floor.

355
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,890
- Ah, I'm fine. It became my habit.  
 - A habit?

356
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,400
I told you that I grew up in the Netherlands.

357
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,540
When I was about eight,

358
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:22,220
I somehow read it from a book that people in Korea usually sleep on the heated floor, not on the bed.

359
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,180
So from then, I started to sleep on the floor.

360
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,370
Because if my biological parents suddenly find me and take me to Korea, I have to adjust well to life in Korea.

361
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:42,230
But my biological parents who I had waited didn't come, and only sleeping on the floor became a habit.

362
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:49,250
Oh, no matter what book you read, I guess you've seen some really old books. Kids slept a lot in beds then as well.

363
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,900
I know. It's the importance of the information!

364
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:03,150
- The supervisor Yoon is looking for me. I should go. 
 - Good luck.

365
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,350
     

366
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,310
Hae Deun!

367
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,950
Yes, Na Ro oppa. I saw your call.

368
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,720
Where are you now?

369
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,590
Right now? I'm on my way to an important meeting.

370
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,460
Is that so.

371
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:40,310
It gives out bad vibes...

372
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,420
I don't know. Why do I have to care?

373
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,930
What the...

374
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,450
     

375
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,020
Are we going abroad as well?

376
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,950
Of course! This is a project group that's targeting the international market.

377
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,490
I should sign here, right?

378
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,190
One second.

379
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,940
You should deposit the training fee first.

380
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,200
Ah, right now..?

381
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,770
We had cases of people signed the contract but delayed to give the training fee and ran away eventually.

382
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,020
You saw the list of our trainers' names. We have all of the most famous people in this industry.

383
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,310
So, you should deposit upfront at least that amount.

384
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,960
What's that?

385
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,680
Are you having doubts about me?

386
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,380
That's disappointing.

387
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,280
Oh, no, why would I?

388
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,480
I really worked hard to save this money.

389
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,830
I canceled my installment savings account.

390
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,720
Ms. Hae Deun. If you become successful, this would be nothing!

391
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,880
Aigo, people are looking for me from the office.

392
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:46,310
- You should quickly deposit and sign the contract. Here. 
      
  - Yes.

393
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,880
     

394
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,780
  Wait!  

395
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,000
- Who is it? 
 - Na Ro oppa... 
 - Manager Joo Man Dae?

396
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:18,200
- Yes, but? 
 - 'Yes, but?'

397
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,690
I'm the manager Joo Man Dae, and how dare you try to pretend you are me?

398
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:32,520
Fake Joo Man Dae, you're under arrest for fraud and blackmail--

399
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,390
  Wait, wait for a second!  

400
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
What is this? Are you guys detectives?

401
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:45,470
- Again, you are under arrest for fraud and blackmail-- 
 - Kim Byung Chul!

402
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,230
That's what my friend said so!

403
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,180
- Send me the money! 
 - Thank you.

404
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,980
Hae Deun, are you okay?

405
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,910
Isn't he the manager Joo Man Dae?

406
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,250
He's not. He's a fake one.

407
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:16,890
It felt so weird, so I asked my friend, who is a detective. It turns out he's a famous con-artist in this industry.

408
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,800
That can't be right.

409
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,520
I got his business card. I even went to the office!

410
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:32,860
This business card is fake, and you went to the company's coffee shop, right? They say it's his regular trick.

411
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,870
He seemed to be close with the trainees over there, too.

412
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:43,730
He probably pretended that. He probably said something like, 'Hey, here!' kind of things in advance.

413
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:57,930
How did you know that I was meeting with this guy? Who told you that?

414
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,690
Ah, that's actually...

415
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,370
You heard me talking to Ra Hoon in the garden, right?

416
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,980
- I did, but... 
 - But how can you humiliate me like this?

417
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,780
You could've just told me straight in the morning! How can you do this to me?

418
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,380
I mean, it's that...

419
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:31,080
Hae Deun, I mean it's, he's...

420
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,870
Noona!

421
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,780
You all came to save me?

422
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,980
It's embarrassing...

423
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,000
Let me go!

424
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,860
I didn't say anything...

425
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,960
- Noona! 
 - Hae Deun!

426
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,750
Do not follow me.

427
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,860
- I should follow her. 
 - Hurry up!

428
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,030
She totally took me wrong.

429
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:14,170
- It's true that you overheard. 
 - What about you?

430
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,120
- I heard it from Ra Hoon face to face. 
 - This or that, it's the same that we both heard unofficially.

431
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,230
- If you keep being like this, then our mutual assistance will be broken. 
 - Mutual assistance?

432
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,530
We just ran into each other on the way here.

433
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,980
Why did you come here in the first place? Are you trying to impress Bit Chae Woon?

434
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:35,210
- I didn't know you'll know that! 
 - What?

435
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,040
Aigoo, I'm leaving since I'm busy.

436
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:47,900
Ha, that cunning penguin. He's really on my nerves.

437
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,040
Noona! Noona, please stop.

438
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,280
I was worried about you, so I discussed it with Jae Hee hyung.

439
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,350
- But I didn't know that guy was a real con-artist. 
 - Right.

440
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:10,490
Everything I do must have looked pathetic to you who's in a prestigious university!

441
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,580
No! What are you talking about it? I was just worried about you--

442
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Thank you for saving me before I got robbed!

443
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,440
I should get back to the office.

444
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,410
Noona! Lee Hae Deun!

445
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:54,650
  My daughter! What do you want to eat tonight? Mom is here for grocery shopping.  

446
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,490
  Tonight's dinner is all for our Hae Deun's favorite!  

447
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,280
Yes, mom!

448
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:16,370
Yes, Hae Deun! Did I give you unnecessary pressure by texting you?

449
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,510
Did it go well?

450
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,550
Of course!

451
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,810
I had many things that I wanted to eat.

452
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,000
  Oh, really? Wait just a second.  

453
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,990
One second. Tell me now. I'll write it down.

454
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:38,810
First, I want stir-fried pork in a really spicy sauce!

455
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,780
And then, mom's style scallion pancake with lots of cheese!

456
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,830
  Oh, Chae Woon doesn't like the pancakes with lots of cheese in it.  

457
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,570
You said today's all for my favorites!

458
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,730
Oh, I'm sorry, Hae Deun! And then, what else?

459
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,560
And then...

460
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,280
I know what you want. Seasoned squid, right?

461
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,530
I already bought some squid for you.

462
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,870
Mom...

463
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,480
I'm sorry.

464
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,380
  Hae Deun, are you crying? What's going on?  

465
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,850
  Did it not go well?  

466
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,000
Don't cry for that.

467
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,780
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mom.

468
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,080
Hae Deun, Hae Deun! My goodness...

469
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,080
  The person you're reaching is unavailable--  

470
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,980
     

471
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,760
Yes, Ra Hoon. Is there something going on with Hae Deun?

472
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,740
You know what's going on, right? What's going on?

473
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,580
     

474
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,540
  I'm sorry? Ms. Lee Hae Deun got failed from the first audition.  

475
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,480
  She has been working as a part-time worker in the office for a few days again.  

476
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,320
Why didn't Hae Deun tell me about this?

477
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,760
Unni...

478
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,240
What happened to you?

479
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,020
If there was something like that going on, then you should've discussed it with me first!

480
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,270
Did you hear it from Ra Hoon? Or Mr. Woo?

481
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,760
Woo Jae Hee knows about this as well?

482
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,420
That's great.

483
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,950
How can everybody knows about it but me!

484
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,700
If I told you, then you were going to say something about it.

485
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:08,420
If you knew that I failed the first audition as well, then you would've said, "I knew you were going to be like that."

486
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,000
Why would I say that if you were doing everything right?

487
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,240
Are you an idiot?

488
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,910
Wasn't it suspicious at the moment when they asked for a training fee?

489
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,180
How can you be so reckless!

490
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,680
I thought it was suspicious as well! But I wanted to trust him! I wanted to trust him because I had nothing.

491
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,790
I thought it could be a real thing.

492
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,780
- Hey! How can you believe that? You are really-- 
 - Hey!

493
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:44,400
Why are you yelling at Hae Deun again! Why!

494
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,410
You guys are the same.

495
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,790
You two are making trouble, and I'm always the bad one!

496
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Why are you talking about me all of a sudden? Am I a set with her? It's ridiculous.

497
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,980
Yes. You guys are a set.

498
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,360
Two trouble makers, buy one get one free!

499
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,710
Do you know how I feel? Have you ever been in my situation?

500
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,440
What's that?

501
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:18,710
  My big sister is so great that you only thought about escaping the house. But do you know how I felt?  

502
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,020
I was afraid that I might get kicked out of the house, that somebody might say that I should leave.

503
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,640
I was always afraid of that since I was young.

504
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,730
You're being ridiculous.

505
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,200
Who said you should get out?

506
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,500
Are you going to get out even somebody says so? You're a shameless, Lee Hae Deun!

507
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:41,530
Do you think I tried to look shameless because I'm really shameless?

508
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,710
Have you ever been kicked out of an adopted house? Well, you would've not since you lived with mom from the beginning.

509
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:53,680
I had been abandoned twice by an adopted family! You know about that as well!

510
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,550
  Do you think I don't remember that?  

511
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:02,350
'You are very pretty, you're a princess, you're like an angel,' they loved me at first,

512
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,870
  but then when they're having a hard time, they said, 'what kind of kid is this selfish,'  

513
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:12,020
'who the hell is your mother and father, I guess you can't change the blood!'

514
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,730
And they took me to the orphanage again.

515
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,540
And turn away cold as if they never knew me.

516
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:30,100
After coming to this house, do you know, do you know how scared I was actually?

517
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,380
I get it. Stop crying.

518
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,080
Yes, Hae Deun. Stop crying.

519
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,980
Mother.

520
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,680
Lee Hae Deun, why did she say that to make mom sad?

521
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,780
Ra Hoon!

522
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,380
- Why are you out here? 
 - Uncle, shh!

523
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,020
It's because of Hae Deun.

524
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,370
Lee Hae Deun.

525
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,830
Why are you talking about the old days!

526
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,580
Stop crying!

527
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,300
How dare you screaming at her! Apologize to her now.

528
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,680
I said, stop crying!

529
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,270
Yes, yes. It's okay. Stop crying.

530
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:13,250
I'll get you something in secret from your mom and unni.

531
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:19,220
- What are you going to get for me? 
 - What do you want? What should I get for you?

532
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,320
Lee Hae Deun, really...

533
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:03,340
- Uncle! Let's go inside a little bit later. 
 - Why?

534
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,450
Ah, to give some time difference?

535
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,040
Oh, that boy moved in today in the Hae Deun's room.

536
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,370
Is that so?

537
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,460
Then is he in the room right now?

538
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,240
I think so?

539
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:26,310
Ah! Why are you telling me that now? It was a mess today like that!

540
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:33,180
- He should get used to it, too. 
 - Get used to it... Ah, it's all ruined now.

541
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,110
  Oh, Mr. Woo!  

542
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:41,580
You haven't had dinner yet, right? I'll make something quick for you.

543
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,010
I was about to make something. Let me cook, please!

544
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,080
No, it's okay. I'll make something.

545
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:53,160
Let's eat dinner with what we already have. Should we make some bibimbap?

546
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,020
  That sounds good!   I'm home!

547
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:01,010
I'm home, too! I'll be back from washing my hands and help you!

548
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,780
- I'll do it. Why don't you go into your room and have some rest? 
 - No, I'm fine.

549
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,880
Yes, mom. Please go in and have some rest.

550
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:16,280
- Ra Hoon, why don't you wash your feet first? 
 - Do I... smell?

551
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,870
I'll be back soon.

552
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:23,260
Oh, why is he...

553
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,470
  You smelled it, too, right?  

554
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,540
Is he already sleeping?

555
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,010
It was loud earlier, right? I'm sorry about that.

556
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:55,560
Hello, I'm Lee Ra Hoon. The one who uses the attic room up there.

557
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,810
Nice to meet you.

558
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,080
Why don't you eat dinner with us..?

559
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,180
Good night.

560
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,730
Nice to meet you, too, Lee Ra Hoon.

561
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,280
- You're going to hurt your stomach, noona. Eat slowly. 
 - Mm! It's so good!

562
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,680
Our Hae Deun eats so well you look like you'll have good luck!

563
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,960
Right, uncle? I have tons of good luck flooding, right?

564
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,230
Of course, you have tons of good luck.

565
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:03,290
Oh, you're giving me that precious sesame oil? Thank you.

566
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,090
Eat as much as you want!

567
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,650
- I heard a new boy moved in. 
 - Yes. He's sleeping right now.

568
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,430
I guess he's tired from studying.

569
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:22,630
That boy must be sleeping hard. This sesame oil smell can make anybody hungry!

570
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:29,580
Ah! I'm starving!

571
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:50,280
But I think... this sesame oil smell is coming from the second floor?

572
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,030
Ah, it's driving me crazy!

573
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:07,060
Wow, this is really good!

574
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,620
- Oh, by the way! Is Na Ro not eating dinner? 
 - He said he's not really hungry.

575
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:22,120
Is that so? He must get hungry, too.

576
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:51,810
  Have you ever been kicked out of an adopted house? I had been abandoned twice by an adopted family! You know about that as well!  

577
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:56,160
  'Who the hell is your mother and father, I guess you can't change the blood!'  

578
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,810
Lee Hae Deun...

579
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,990
How can that be the same as me?

580
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:27,330
Thank you for helping Hae Deun today.

581
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,190
It was nothing.

582
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:38,930
But you should've told me about it. If I knew about it, I could have taken measures.

583
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,410
I thought you would be upset and sad.

584
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:57,350
What's wrong with me being upset? I'm the one in charge of upsetting, angry, and responsible things in this family.

585
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,880
I wanted to help you. Because it seems like you always carry it all by yourself.

586
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,740
Why do you want to help me?

587
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:14,450
Ah, because I help your company's work?

588
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:17,480
Is it like a koala repaying its kindness?

589
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,890
Something like that. And we're the same Samgwang people as well.

590
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,080
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

591
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,650
Why?

592
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,600
- It's nothing! 
 - Tell me, I want to laugh with you!

593
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,980
- It's really nothing! 
 - Why?

594
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,680
What is it?

595
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,280
- Why are you laughing? 
 - I like it.

596
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,080
- What are you talking about it? What is it? 
 - I like it the way it is now.

597
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,230
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

598
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,580
What is it?

599
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,250
Mom...

600
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,770
Just do it like this to your sister as well.

601
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,700
This is the ultimate Kka-bang-kwon.

602
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:30,090
Like the word that you guys say these days. 
     

603
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,180
Mom...

604
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:38,230
My daughter, my Hae Deun.

605
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,180
How can you say such things? I can't live without you.

606
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:51,820
You've been my daughter since the first time I met you.

607
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:55,090
And you'll be my daughter forever.

608
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,350
Mom...

609
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:08,000
I thought you are all grown up, but you still smell like a baby.

610
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,880
You smell so sweet!

611
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,780
You smell so good.

612
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,200
  I think those two seats need to be taken out.  

613
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,480
  Please do that.  

614
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,380
Director Jang, please take good care of all the details so that people who visit today don't have any inconvenience.

615
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,460
Yes, I got it.

616
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:48,680
Thank you to all of you who worked hard preparing for the launching show.

617
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:51,780
Let's work hard until the end of the event!

618
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:56,000
- Fighting! 
   - Fighting!  

619
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,870
Yes...

620
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:16,660
Let's do it one by one.

621
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:23,660
Today I'm just going to tell them that I'm the mother of Chae Woon.

622
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:29,690
Someday I'll be able to tell everything.

623
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,100
Someday I will.

624
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:44,050
- One of the models can't come today? 
 No. I just got a call that she went to an emergency room for stomachache...

625
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,540
- What are we going to do? It's about to start. 
 - There's no model to come right now.

626
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,140
- We don't have time, why don't you do it? 
 - What?

627
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,810
Are you Ms. Soon Jung by any chance?

628
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,880
Oh my, are you young lady Min Jae?

629
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:21,460
My goodness, you are Soon Jung! It's so good to see you again!

630
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,080
I heard from Jung Won that you'll come to the event.

631
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,680
Young lady Min Jae, you didn't change at all!

632
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,680
I gained weight! You are the one who didn't change at all.

633
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,050
- Let's go. 
 - Ah, yes.

634
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,410
Let's go inside.

635
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:06,730
I have to go to the restroom. Why don't you go inside first?

636
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,050
Okay, I will.

637
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,880
  The products we're going to show you now are products that express urban sensibility in style.  

638
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:28,060
  This FW design shows the items that you can wear in your daily life, which will give you comfort as you see it as well.  

639
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:23,370
What should I wear next?

640
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,280
- Ms. Bit Chae Woon! 
 - Hello!

641
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,510
- You are stunning! 
 - Thank you so much.

642
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:38,290
- Not this one, but wear this one. This is the hottest one of the new season. 
 - Yes!

643
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,280
One second.

644
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,380
You're on the stage for the fashion show, so let's put on some heavier make-up.

645
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,580
- Ms. Bit Chae Woon! You'll be holding this when you go up on the stage this time! 
 - Chae Woon?

646
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:17,550
Chae Woon!

647
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:21,680
Ms. Bit Chae Woon! Let's put on some highlighter as well.

648
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,760
Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

649
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:45,980
You're very pretty!

650
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,650
Thank you.

651
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,080
  - Mom! 
 - Seo Yeon.  

652
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:03,380
  - I missed you so much, mom. 
 - My daughter, Seo Yeon.  

653
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:08,120
No, it can't happen... No way...

654
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,680
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

655
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:40,590
No, it can't happen. No way...

656
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,330
No way...

657
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,210
My Chae Woon.

658
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,280
I can't let go of my Chae Woon.

659
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:25,280
My daughter, my Chae Woon... I can't let her go.

660
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:11,630
I guess I like cleaning the house in the first place.

661
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,190
Who's that?

662
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:07,660
The more I look at him, the more good looking he is!

663
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,750
Yes, uncle. My father?

664
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:19,470
I haven't heard from him in a while. Is there something going on with him?

665
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:30,230
Well, I'm glad he's doing fine. Uncle!

666
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,560
Please take good care of my father.

667
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,880
  If something is going on, then please let me know.  

668
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,980
Okay!

669
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,770
Huh?

670
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:48,460
Did I do this?

671
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,980
My goodness. How can I leave the contract at home?

672
01:06:53,990 --> 01:07:00,160
Wait, it gets cold at night these days. Maybe I should wear something thicker?

673
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,380
What's wrong with this?

674
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:24,440
Ah, I should just wear what I'm wearing.

675
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,780
  Who the hell are you!  

676
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,200
- Father! 
 - I'm sorry?

677
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:53,280
Father!

678
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,850
I-I'm James.

679
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:00,730
F-Father!

680
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:13,060
♫   In the extravagant building forest   ♫

681
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:17,320
♫   You're walking with confidence, City Boy   ♫

682
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:20,980
♫   In the suffocating gaze of people   ♫

683
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,080
♫   You're walking with pride, Working Girl   ♫

684
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:29,780
♫   You're the star of this city, So beautiful Girl   ♫ 
      

685
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,480
  How is your husband?  

686
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,380
  Oh my, is Soon Jung still has feelings for him?  

687
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,780
  Of course, he's doing well! He's busy with his company. Yes, honey!  

688
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,280
  - What am I going to do now? 
 - Can I bring you some clothes to change into?  

689
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,680
  Ms. Bit Chae Woon! Give that to me and go back to work.  

690
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:48,080
  - This is for a visitor in the bathroom right now. 
 - I know. She's my boyfriend's mother.  

691
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,490
  - All of your three daughters look like good people. 
 - Three daughters?  

692
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,040
  - I think you're not sleeping. Why don't we properly say hello? 
 - Excuse me!  

693
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,380
  - Excuse me! 
 - Maybe he has something like social phobia?  

694
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,680
  Is he peeling the potatoes?  

695
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:03,380
  - I think he was very sweet to his wife as well. 
 - I think so as well.  

696
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,150
  Ms. Bit Chae Woon is your daughter?  

697
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,610
  But you weren't married at that time.
