1
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,050
 
What are you going to ramble about?

2
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,950
Why don't you try it?

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,460
Gosh.

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,950
You can't even say it.

5
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,930
What are you guys doing this late at night?

6
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,660
Get out of here.

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,580
If you don't leave, I will.

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,210
- Mom.
- You asked me...

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,300
to raise Seo Yeon.

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,500
Lee Soon Jung.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,790
Why don't you say it right?

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,490
Am I the one who took Seo Yeon
 to you in the beginning?

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,290
- It was that moron, Park Pil Hong!
- Yes.

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,570
The one who brought Seo Yeon to me

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,650
was Park Pil Hong.

16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,280
Seo Yeon's birth father.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,970
That's right.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,030
That jerk tried to pay off the debt 
he owed while gambling,

19
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,170
so the father kidnapped his own daughter.

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,300
 You, Park Pil Hong. 

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,960
 I know what you're trying
 to do with Seo Yeon. 

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,910
- Yes?
 - Soon Jung. 

23
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,050
 Park Pil Hong is on his way over there. 

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,870
 I don't know what he'll do. 

25
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,840
What?

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
 Take Seo Yeon and hide
 as far as you can. 

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,040
 I'll contact you again. 

28
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,240
 Park Pil Hong, you... 

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,220
 If you don't bring back 
Seo Yeon right away, 

30
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,290
 I'll report you for kidnapping. 

31
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,490
 I ran away to protect Seo Yeon. 

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,680
 I wanted to protect Seo Yeon from
 Park Pil Hong, who was trying to use Seo Yeon. 

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,110
I thought I had to take care of 
Seo Yeon for a short while.

34
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,690
Mom...

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,820
Did you know that Soon Jung 
had Seo Yeon all this time?

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,330
Ever since that time...

37
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,950
The Chairwoman stopped calling me.

38
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,830
So I went over to your house, Young Lady.

39
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,380
Hey, Jung Won.

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,760
No need to listen to her any further.

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,350
She's making this up.

42
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,160
You came to my house?

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,710
Then you should've come in.

44
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,150
And you should've told me...

45
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,040
that you had Seo Yeon!

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,890
But at the time, you already...

47
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,670
 Seo Yeon... 

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,110
 was already no longer in this world. 

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
Are you...

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,980
on your way to Jung Won?

51
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,130
Yes.

52
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,900
I want to tell her that I have Seo Yeon.

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,770
No, Soon Jung!

54
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,810
Jung Won will leave for
 the States in a few days.

55
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,130
After Jung Won receives
 her treatment,

56
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,120
I'll be sure to call you then.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
Do you think I'll abandon 
my granddaughter?

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,460
Just until then.

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,430
If you bring Seo Yeon back to her,

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,790
Jung Won will never get rid 
of that Park Pil Hong.

61
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,350
I'm begging you.

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,510
Soon Jung, please.

63
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm begging you.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
Please, I beg you.

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,400
Madam...

66
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,750
 I believed what she said and waited. 

67
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,390
But...

68
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,960
I couldn't get in touch with you after that.

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,120
I looked for you all over the place.

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,640
Yeah, right. You're writing a novel.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,560
My goodness.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,270
Then...

73
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,740
did you deceive me, Mom?

74
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,900
You made it up as thought
 Seo Yeon was dead,

75
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,920
and you blamed
 everything on Soon Jung.

76
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,740
You cut off contact...

77
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,300
Is that right?

78
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,080
How could you do this, Mom?

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,720
- I...
- Huh?

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,760
- I...
- Huh?

81
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,100
I don't know any of this.

82
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,210
Hey, Lee Soon Jung.

83
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,410
You plotted this with that jerk, right?

84
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,410
Park Pil Hong is behind all this.

85
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,060
How could you do this as a mom?

86
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,340
Why?

87
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,660
Why?

88
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,150
How could you do this? 
How could you?

89
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,670
How could you?

90
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,360
How could you do this, Mom?

91
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,320
How...

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,050
I did because I'm a mom.

93
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,980
Because I'm a mom!

94
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,700
To protect you...

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,050
For my daughter...

96
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,640
Because of that Park Pil Hong...

97
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,710
your life was ruined.

98
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,960
You were withering away
 as the days went by...

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,800
and I couldn't stand to watch it.

100
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,940
I did it to save my daughter.

101
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,290
I did it to save my daughter!

102
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,490
How could you...

103
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,500
I believed that was the only way...

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,900
I could save you.

105
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,590
Lee Soon Jung, so...

106
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,400
do you feel better now that you dug 
everything out in the open?

107
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,380
What good does it do for 
Seo Yeon to find this out?

108
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,260
How could you barge in at this late hour
 and blow this out of the water?

109
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,620
I guess you're worried about 
your granddaughter now?

110
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,330
I'm not saying this to make 
myself feel better.

111
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,590
Your granddaughter, Seo Yeon...

112
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,570
She shouldn't be hurting anymore

113
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,730
and get wounded more.

114
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,660
Don't...

115
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,640
blame me too much.

116
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,850
Anyway, know that the root of all this

117
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,720
is because of your father, Park Pil Hong.

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,930
Chairwoman.

119
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,400
Even if we say he is the start of all this,

120
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,260
don't you feel...

121
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,260
bad toward my mom and me?

122
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,050
What?

123
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,360
You threatened my kind and innocent 
mom and pushed me on her,

124
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,890
and you cut off contact.

125
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,440
And after running into her again,

126
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,480
you have no regrets nor remorse,

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,400
and you still pain my mom.

128
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,090
When I see you try to get out 
of this even at this moment,

129
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,330
I don't think I can forgive you.

130
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,520
- Look at you...
- However...

131
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,010
just as my mom sacrificed for my sake,

132
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,950
what you said about 
what you did as a mom...

133
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,050
I'll reflect on it and try 
to understand you.

134
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,900
Because you're the mother
 of my birth mother.

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,700
Chae Woon...

136
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,000
Soon Jung.

137
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,830
You went through a lot tonight.

138
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,450
Don't mention it.

139
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,230
It was tough for you, right?

140
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,310
Chae Woon.

141
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,180
Go over to your mom's tonight.

142
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,970
It's okay.

143
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,980
Chae Woon...

144
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,320
Go to the CEO's house.

145
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,620
No, Soon Jung.

146
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,910
Please do as I say tonight.

147
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,570
Please do that.

148
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,570
Then...

149
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,890
could Jae Hee...

150
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,190
CEO, I'll drive you home.

151
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,990
No, it's okay.

152
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,720
But still.

153
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,300
Here. Drive carefully.

154
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,940
Mother, go home safely.

155
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,630
Okay.

156
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,860
Thanks, Mr. Woo.

157
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,340
CEO...

158
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,860
Okay.

159
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,010
I'll get going.

160
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,110
Good night.

161
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,770
 Oh, my! Kamjiki! 

162
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,160
 Oh, my! Kamjiki was there! 

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
That doll, Kamjiki!

164
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,900
Just throw it out!

165
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,700
Right.

166
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,900
It's dripping.

167
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,250
Aigoo.

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
Right...

169
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,090
I'm sure...

170
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,640
Min Jae doesn't want to 
see the tip of my head.

171
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,860
I'm sure she's disappointed
 in me so much.

172
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,880
I'll just have to stop...

173
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,220
appearing in front of Min Jae.

174
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,560
When this dries, I'll messenger it over.

175
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,940
Aigoo.

176
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,500
She must've struggled so much.

177
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,200
Aigoo.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
It's so cute.

179
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,180
Jung Min Jae, you dunce.

180
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,100
You're doing this again?

181
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
Aigoo.

182
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,060
But Woo Jung Hoo just 
got his memory back...

183
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,950
and he's recuperating right now.

184
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,420
I should help him out.

185
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,710
As a friend.

186
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm the loyal Jung Min Jae.

187
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,190
Loyalty!

188
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,970
♫  I guess I'm still young  ♫

189
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,820
My gosh.

190
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:18,550
♫  Mom, why am I keep waiting  ♫

191
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,380
 Why did he look so cool to me then? 

192
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,460
He's so different now, though.

193
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,700
Oh, my.

194
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,630
♫  I guess I'm still young  ♫

195
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,370
Chae Woon.

196
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,710
You were shocked, huh?

197
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,860
About your birth father.

198
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,450
I expected it since I heard
 Chairwoman speaking of him last time.

199
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,080
It wasn't that big of a shock.

200
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,030
Because he's like that,

201
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,770
he let the CEO get sick like that.

202
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,440
And I've never even seen his face.

203
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,900
I don't care. I'm okay.

204
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,940
 My Seo Yeon... 

205
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,380
 Oh, she's Bit Chae Woon now. 

206
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,550
 Bit Chae Woo. She grew up so well. 

207
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,760
Wait, Chae Woon.

208
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,770
By chance...

209
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,260
if your birth father calls you,

210
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,020
you have to tell me.

211
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,290
Don't hide it from me.

212
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,820
By chance, did he contact you?

213
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,920
What?

214
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,410
No. He didn't.

215
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,190
I'm just saying...

216
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,990
Just in case that happens.

217
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,140
- All right.
- Okay.

218
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,600
It's good.

219
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,690
So good.

220
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,420
What are you guys doing?

221
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,050
Unni, where did you go?

222
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,170
Hey!

223
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,960
Bit Chae, you're here again?

224
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,230
What the heck? I thought you 
left without saying bye.

225
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,090
I'm sorry I keep coming over.

226
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,600
I missed you, Auntie. So I came.

227
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
Good, good. I'm glad.

228
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,150
Why did you guys make such a mess?

229
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,580
We'll clean up.

230
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,970
Noona, you're here.

231
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,080
Why were you in the 
bathroom for so long?

232
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,390
Why do you look like that?

233
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,580
My stomach has been gurgling...
 I'm going nuts.

234
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,780
Geez, I told you to eat 
more sweet potatoes.

235
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,360
This works wonders for constipation.

236
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
Right, Auntie?

237
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,880
- That's right.
- Ra Hoon.

238
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,230
Do you still feel like that?

239
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,910
Wait a minute.

240
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,080
Try this.

241
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,790
I heard it's good if 
you take this every day.

242
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,050
Really? Give me one.

243
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,480
- You, too?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,190
Here are two.

245
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,510
Give me one, too.

246
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,200
You, too?

247
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,040
Okay.

248
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,820
I'll have one, too.

249
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,100
It's good for the entire family to take it.

250
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,090
Of course, you're the only one who 
cares about the family's health, Mom.

251
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,630
Where did you two go?

252
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,050
You two disappeared 
without saying anything.

253
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,100
We were on a date.

254
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,430
- What the heck?
- Right, Mom?

255
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,190
Oppa.

256
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,390
Seo Ah, are you feeling better now?

257
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,860
Yeah.

258
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,710
Mom.

259
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,490
What's going on?

260
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,400
Thanks, Jae Hee.

261
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,280
Do you want some tea 
before you go?

262
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,190
I'm okay. I'll get going.

263
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Where is Bit Chae Woon that 
you brought Mom home?

264
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,690
Did Bit Chae Woon go
 to that other house?

265
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,370
Seo Ah, how did you know
 that she went there?

266
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,300
Well, just my feeling.

267
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,660
- Be careful going home, Jae Hee.
- Okay, Mother.

268
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,710
Get some rest.

269
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,180
Bye, Seo Ah.

270
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,700
Thanks.

271
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,930
Mom, what's going on?

272
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,500
What's going on that you leave me out?

273
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,080
Seo Ah.

274
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,060
It's not like that, okay?

275
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,840
I'll go change.

276
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
Mom.

277
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,880
I guess you completely 
acknowledge it now.

278
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,170
Accepting Jae Hee oppa as 
Bit Chae Woon's boyfriend.

279
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,450
I'm really having a hard 
time right now. Okay?

280
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,130
Could you go a little easy on me?

281
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,030
Mom.

282
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,740
 
 Jae Hee oppa brought my mom home. 

283
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,700
 It feels like they were all together. 

284
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,430
 Observe the mood on that side. 

285
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,810
Bit Chae Woon and...

286
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,400
meeting of this mother and that mother?

287
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,230
They must've exposed something else.

288
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,800
Geez...

289
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,420
I'm not even shocked anymore.

290
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,090
That's what happened.

291
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,400
I see.

292
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,730
Unni, you did great!

293
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,080
Okay?

294
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,630
You did great.

295
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,660
Did you resolve your frustration 
and injustice a little bit now?

296
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,090
Yeah, a little bit.

297
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,540
You did great.

298
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,280
You did well.

299
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,690
You couldn't even tell anyone. 
You must've been...

300
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,450
rotting from inside out.

301
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,880
This is the best thing you've done
 in your life, Lee Soon Jung.

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,400
- But Man Jung.
- Yeah?

303
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,470
Well...

304
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,540
Chae Woon knows everything now.

305
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,610
About her birth father.

306
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
You can't help that.

307
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,470
You can't make everything great.

308
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,270
And Chae Woon will 
be fine with that stuff.

309
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,650
When you think about 
how upset she was

310
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,380
because of worries about you,

311
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,500
it's no big deal finding out about 
what kind of man her father is.

312
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,310
It's okay. It's okay.

313
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you really think so?

314
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,740
But her birth father...

315
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,100
I'm worried that he'll do something bad.

316
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,600
I should make a cool entrance
 in front of my Seo Yeon soon.

317
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,140
If so, for now...

318
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,490
I should pull my strings with that lady.

319
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,070
My ex-mother-in-law.

320
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,740
Despicable people!

321
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,870
How dare they insult me by 
digging up all that stuff?

322
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,590
Aigoo!

323
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,470
She sure is Park Pil Hong's daughter.

324
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,240
Aigoo...

325
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,180
Hi, Ms. Goo.

326
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,410
Why?

327
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,360
CEO Kim met a man?

328
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,540
Yes.

329
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,870
He seemed around the CEO's age.

330
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,390
And the CEO...

331
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,420
What about her?

332
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,870
 She seemed very upset. 

333
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,220
Really?

334
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,630
All right, Ms. Goo.

335
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,240
Keep checking and report to me.

336
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,890
That seems...

337
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,750
like Park Pil Hong.

338
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,520
Since he's out, I knew 
he'd come at some point.

339
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,180
Park Pil Hong...

340
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,650
He wouldn't approach 
Jung Won for money.

341
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,540
He'll come to me in the end.

342
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,190
How should I get that punk?

343
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,880
My gosh!

344
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,010
It's so nice to lie down here 
first time in a while.

345
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,240
What's with you guys?

346
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,600
What are you staring at?

347
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,400
Unni, I missed you so much.

348
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,200
- So I want to stare when I can.
 - Me, too.

349
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,260
Okay. Look as much as you want.

350
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,640
How is living in that house?

351
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,410
The house is super nice, huh?
 Really spacious, too.

352
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,100
It is spacious.

353
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,280
At first, I couldn't sleep 
because it felt so unfamiliar.

354
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,420
But after living there a while,

355
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,320
I think, "Ah, people live here, too."

356
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,260
But I like our house better.

357
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,350
Gosh, it's because you're with us.

358
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,710
Of course.

359
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,020
Okay, it's because of you guys.

360
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,660
How is the CEO? Is she good to you?

361
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,100
Yeah, she's good to me.

362
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,610
But I'm still awkward with her.

363
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,400
Why? She's your birth mom.

364
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,650
I think I get it.

365
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,190
When we're with our mom,

366
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,130
we can roll around in our PJs.

367
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,850
But with the CEO,

368
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,860
you feel like you have to
 dress sophisticated and stuff.

369
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,160
- Right?
- How did you know?

370
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,780
Hey, how is your work going?

371
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,160
Gosh, I'm totally torn because of that.

372
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,840
I have two paths in front of me.

373
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,220
But I don't know which path to take.

374
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,760
Why do you have two paths, Noona?

375
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,260
One is being a trainee, and...

376
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,900
- the other one is...
- The other one is...

377
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,440
It's a secret. 
What should I do, Unni?

378
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,260
Well...

379
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,410
Aside from everything else,

380
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,020
choose the one that excited you.

381
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,310
"I'd make tons of money if I do this" or

382
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,470
"I can be cool in front of others."

383
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,700
Apart from all that.

384
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,840
Something that excites me?

385
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,720
Her worried face is so cute.

386
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,700
It's cute. I can hear 
your brain creaking, too.

387
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,980
Am I a rock head that I creak around?

388
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,350
- Ouch.
- Don't do that.

389
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,820
- How can you?
- Now, now!

390
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,030
- Hey!
- Hit him now!

391
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,760
I got her. Hit her back.

392
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,830
Did you guys talk?

393
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,720
No, I have a long way to go.

394
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,190
Chae Woon.

395
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,960
You should go home now.

396
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,930
It's getting late.

397
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,460
Wasn't she sleeping over tonight?

398
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,720
What? I thought that, too.

399
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,090
Chae Woon.

400
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,010
 My gosh... 

401
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,440
 I can't tell Unni about 
Hwang Na Ro right now. 

402
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,300
What in the world? I thought 
you were sleeping over.

403
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,310
Sleep over, please?

404
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,470
Do you have to go?

405
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,820
Aigoo.

406
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,270
My Chae Woon.

407
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,110
I heard everything.

408
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,040
You went through a lot today.

409
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,890
I didn't do anything.

410
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,560
Mom's the one 
who went through a lot.

411
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,780
What in the world? Something really 
did happen to Mom and Unni.

412
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,530
And you won't tell me.

413
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,180
- The thing is...
- Yeah.

414
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,020
- Okay? Listen up.
- Okay.

415
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,900
Your mom and Bit Chae
 threw a big punch.

416
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,240
I feel like I got rid of indigestion
 that I've had for ten years.

417
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,400
- Really?
- Man Jung.

418
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,780
Aigoo, so cold.

419
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,150
It's so cold.

420
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,560
Hi, Chae Woon.

421
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,300
Chae Woon, you're back.

422
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm home.

423
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,590
Welcome, Mr. Woo.

424
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,400
Uncle, did you work?

425
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah.

426
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,200
I ran into Mr. Woo on the way in.

427
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,970
Did you drive the CEO home okay?

428
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,140
Yes, Mother.

429
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,180
CEO?

430
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,770
What the heck? Tell me.

431
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,370
- Yeah, tell me, too.
- Okay.

432
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,250
I'll brief you later in detail.

433
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,380
Just wait.

434
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,860
Chae Woon, are you leaving?

435
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,260
CEO told you to sleep over.

436
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,880
See, Mom?

437
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,310
- Unni!
- Just go.

438
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,800
You left your cellphone.

439
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,080
Thanks.

440
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,080
I'll go, Mom.

441
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,860
Okay.

442
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,450
Let's go then, Moong-i.

443
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,100
"Moong-i"?

444
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,280
Moong-i?

445
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,260
Do you call Noona "Moong-i"?

446
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,730
What the heck? Moong-i?

447
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,150
That's a puppy name.

448
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,750
Should I call you "Moong-i noona"?

449
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,120
What, what?

450
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,530
Lovers can...

451
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,880
have terms of endearment.

452
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,850
Moong-i.

453
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,530
Moong-i, goodbye.

454
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,630
Moong-i.

455
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,710
Moong-i, it was a tough day
 for you, huh?

456
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,400
But I feel good, though.

457
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,370
You got to settle the injustice 
that your mom was enduring.

458
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,740
Thanks, Koala...

459
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,520
for staying with me.

460
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,650
That's why I'm your Koala.

461
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,460
Why?

462
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,550
I'm glad that we settled the injustice
 my mom was enduring.

463
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,370
But Mom...

464
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,440
and the CEO got so hurt.

465
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,970
I feel bad about that.

466
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,550
And as I suspected,

467
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,230
my birth father is not a good man.

468
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,150
As expected, I was...

469
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,250
an abandoned child.

470
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,630
After having confirmed
 those facts, I feel a bit...

471
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,810
Moong-i.

472
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,840
I really love you so much.

473
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,180
But your pain...

474
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,980
and your wound...

475
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,120
How can I understand all that?

476
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,350
I want to know and feel all that

477
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,190
to share the burden with you.

478
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,020
But I can't do that.

479
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,190
I feel so bad and...

480
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,680
it's upsetting.

481
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,560
But...

482
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,120
it's all in the past.

483
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,980
I'm by your side now, Moong-i.

484
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,550
We're in love like this.

485
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,520
I will...

486
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,490
love you...

487
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,390
very, very much. Forever...

488
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,070
I'll love you the most in the world.

489
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,860
So...

490
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,070
all your sorrows...

491
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,760
Let's shake them off 
a little bit together.

492
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,010
Okay?

493
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,410
 Together... 

494
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,180
 What if Koala has to 
struggle because of me? 

495
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,970
You have me.

496
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,940
Gosh.

497
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,360
 Na Ro! 

498
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,490
 Na Ro! 

499
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,130
Hi, Auntie.

500
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,560
You know...

501
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,970
we made some sweet potatoes earlier.

502
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,050
Tangerines, too. I brought you some.

503
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,290
Gosh, thank you.

504
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,480
You're the only one, Auntie.

505
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,560
Right?

506
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,680
Would you like to come
 in for a moment?

507
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,910
- Shall I?
- Sure.

508
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,580
Let me take a look. 
It's my first time in your room.

509
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,520
Whoa, you're so organized.

510
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,540
You're the opposite of me.

511
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,720
Gosh.

512
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,320
What's that?

513
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,500
Are you doing math?

514
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,140
Yes, just as a hobby.

515
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,010
You're the same as me. 
I do that, too.

516
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,090
If you solve math problems when 
you have too many thoughts,

517
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,640
you clear your head. Right?

518
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,450
You feel refreshed.

519
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,470
- Right?
- Yeah.

520
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,690
Of course. You and I are in sync.

521
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,840
That's right.

522
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,860
We're in sync.

523
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,620
Do you have something to say?

524
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,270
Me?

525
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,430
Well...

526
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,370
You know...

527
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,610
I had said that I saw you before.

528
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,550
And I remembered where recently.

529
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,200
I guess I could be wrong.

530
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,460
Well...

531
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,660
A couple of times a year,

532
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,370
I do medical volunteer work.

533
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,220
Over there.

534
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,740
Well...

535
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,620
At Nambu Prison?

536
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,810
Now that I think about it, 
I remember you.

537
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,430
A doctor with a nice impression.

538
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,710
I felt so out of place when
 I first came back to Korea.

539
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I had a friend who treated
 me like a brother.

540
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,570
I thought if I had an older brother,

541
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,010
he'd be like that. 
He was so good to me.

542
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,750
I believed anything he said 
and followed his lead.

543
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,200
Come to find out later...

544
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,290
he used my identity and 
did some bad things.

545
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,550
So I got into lots of debt,

546
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,200
and I was accused of being a fraudster.

547
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,900
That's that, but...

548
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,550
I still can't believe that someone
 I trusted and looked up to

549
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,900
betrayed me.

550
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,100
That's what happened.

551
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,810
Gosh.

552
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,890
What a terrible a**hole.

553
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,720
So it takes...

554
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,900
only a moment to ruin your life.

555
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,940
Well, it's not like I think ill of you 
because I saw you there,

556
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
but I was wondering if
 you're the one I saw there.

557
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,500
Did you wish you were wrong?

558
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,420
Well...

559
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,820
You know.

560
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,280
I totally understand how you feel.

561
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,660
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

562
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,710
My gosh.

563
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,310
No.

564
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,760
I'm sorry if I upset you.

565
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,990
No.

566
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
I'm the one who is thankful
 that you asked me

567
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,510
quietly like this.

568
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,610
I stayed in a young man's room
 for too long. Right?

569
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,070
How tacky of me.

570
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,610
I'll go, Na Ro. Goodnight.

571
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,650
Okay.

572
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,900
- Goodnight, Auntie.
- Okay, bye.

573
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,100
Geez, even Auntie knows.

574
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,350
Should I move out of 
this house for real?

575
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,640
Why are you outside?

576
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,570
Well, you know...

577
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,150
I thought you were going 
into that room.

578
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,790
What did he say?

579
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,320
Gosh, wow...

580
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,430
Na Ro got mixed up with a fraudster.

581
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,290
He must've been in shock.

582
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,630
After coming back to his motherland.

583
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,020
Aigoo.

584
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,700
Why?

585
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,540
I think it's weirder.

586
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,600
What do you mean?

587
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,850
You said he was crying
 while telling you about it.

588
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,520
That's what's weirder.

589
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,420
I don't believe all tears.

590
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,930
Why don't you believe it?

591
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,120
Because he was so upset for real...

592
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,300
I'm sure he told you in tears 
because it upset him so much.

593
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,860
If you look...

594
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,200
there are tears you can't trust.

595
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,590
Something of a show.

596
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,710
Hiding anger behind the tears. 
Something like that.

597
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,260
Nah!

598
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,870
It's not good to look at it like that.

599
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,100
I'm sure Na Ro wanted 
to open up his heart

600
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,850
to you, Jjung-a.

601
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,120
Aigoo, to see a person like that is...

602
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,960
a bit, you know?

603
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,040
Why?

604
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,320
You're so kind.

605
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
Oh, so suddenly?

606
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,160
You were worried about me and that's 
why you were hanging out there, huh?

607
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,570
Gosh, that's not it.

608
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,180
I saw you going into Na Ro's room...

609
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,070
so I was wondering what's going on.

610
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,980
I thought, "Why is she going into 
a young man's bedroom at night?"

611
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,620
That's why.

612
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,320
You're calling me "Jjung-a" now.

613
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,570
Aunt, let's go inside.

614
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,700
I'm sorry about earlier.

615
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,020
I said to tell Unni about us, but

616
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,340
I completely ignored it.

617
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,210
When?

618
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,790
I don't remember at all.

619
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,860
When Unni walked toward us,

620
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,650
I couldn't tell her.

621
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,410
I'm living in her house for free...

622
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,370
and say that I like someone...

623
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,950
I couldn't say it.

624
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,390
I was too embarrassed.

625
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,060
Jjung-a.

626
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,500
I'm really okay.

627
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,700
Just do what you want to do.

628
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,430
Just do whatever you want to do.

629
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,080
I'm really fine.

630
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,800
Wow, it's so cold.

631
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,000
Gosh, so gold. Let's go inside.

632
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,489
Is it you, Seo Ah?

633
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,369
I'm home.

634
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:52,809
Chae Woon.

635
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,859
I told you to sleep over. 
Why did you come?

636
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,619
I was going to, but...

637
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:10,469
she kept telling me to leave.

638
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,799
Aigoo.

639
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:13,769
And you came?

640
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:18,109
And...

641
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:22,389
I was worried about Mom.

642
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,609
Soon Jung? What's wrong 
with Soon Jung?

643
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:29,059
No.

644
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:33,069
You, Mom.

645
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:43,459
Chae Woon.

646
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:45,789
Well...

647
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:50,039
I couldn't call you "mom" 
because I was embarrassed.

648
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,919
But I want to call you "mom" 
from now on.

649
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,849
I can do that, right?

650
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,749
Of course.

651
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,609
Of course, you can.

652
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,809
Yes, you can.

653
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:13,779
I didn't even...

654
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:19,109
expect you to call me "mom."

655
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:22,349
Thanks.

656
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,999
Oh, no.

657
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,989
I should've called you that sooner.

658
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,239
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:31,409
No.

660
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,789
Chae Woon, earlier...

661
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:40,169
you must've been shocked
 hearing everything.

662
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:43,329
A little bit.

663
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:49,709
It's all my fault.

664
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:56,019
Everything started with me.

665
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:58,749
No, don't think that.

666
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:03,109
You can live a good life
 and be happy now.

667
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:07,279
Yeah, let's do that. Okay?

668
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:12,039
I will be really good to Soon Jung.

669
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:16,419
Soon Jung who raised my Seo Yeon

670
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,869
so well like this.

671
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:21,429
I'll live...

672
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,619
repaying the debt for life.

673
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,699
Thank you.

674
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:29,119
No, I'm grateful.

675
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,099
 Mom, I got home okay. 

676
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,459
 You had a rough day today. 

677
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:44,479
 Get some rest. 

678
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:51,059
 

679
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:52,499
 Soon Jung. 

680
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:56,039
 I told you to let Chae Woon sleep over there. 
Why did you send her back? 

681
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,339
 Don't send her back next time. 

682
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:02,149
 You went through so much, Soon Jung. 

683
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,799
 I'm so sorry and... 

684
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,349
 thank you. 

685
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:13,459
♫  My heart is opening arms to you  ♫

686
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:19,059
♫  I'm barely going through today  ♫

687
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:25,319
♫  When the memories are fading  ♫

688
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,789
♫  I stand on the street  ♫

689
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:30,469
 

690
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:36,659
♫  I'm trying to erase it again and again  ♫

691
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,209
♫  But I can still hear you 
breathing on my ear  ♫

692
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:46,629
♫  Did you forget? 
Did you forget about me?  ♫

693
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:50,689
♫  I'm still waiting for you  ♫

694
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:51,849
Dad.

695
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:56,639
♫  My love is crying  ♫

696
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,309
Why did you do that?

697
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:05,489
♫  My heart is filled with tears  ♫

698
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:11,769
♫  I'm trying to erase it 
again and again  ♫

699
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:18,159
♫  But I keep thinking of your face  ♫

700
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:29,369
 Whoa, nice. 

701
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:31,709
 - Looks good.
- It's fancy. 

702
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:43,039
This is fried tofu.

703
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:44,839
This is...

704
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,469
beef jangjorim.

705
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:49,059
No, no.

706
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:53,589
It's beef jangjorim with quail eggs.

707
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,019
Salty. So salty.

708
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,179
And this is...

709
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,559
miyukgook with...

710
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,129
shredded brisket.

711
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:17,879
It's early in the morning. 
Thank you, sir.

712
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:18,999
Good day.

713
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,639
What's this?

714
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,699
Kamjiki!

715
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,399
Kamjiki!

716
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:37,329
How are you?

717
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,139
Gosh, Kamjiki. My Kamjiki.

718
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:41,389
My gosh.

719
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,829
It was pretty dirty.

720
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:47,869
It's clean now.

721
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:49,579
♫  Even though...  ♫

722
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,519
♫  Life is...  ♫

723
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:04,679
 I had ingredients left over from last time. 

724
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,099
 So I made some side dishes. 

725
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:08,889
 I won't send over side dishes anymore. 

726
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:10,709
 Be healthy. 

727
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,369
Aigoo.

728
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:40,079
Gosh.

729
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:43,929
They're...

730
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:45,809
food...

731
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,259
I'm craving now.

732
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,149
 

733
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:22,589
- I got the side dishes.
- I got Kamjiki.

734
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,369
It arrived.

735
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:30,169
What a wonderful world.

736
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:31,389
A nice country.

737
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:33,079
Kamjiki got clean.

738
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,809
Did you wash him?

739
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:36,109
No.

740
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:37,459
At a laundrymat.

741
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:39,249
A laundrymat?

742
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,879
You?

743
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,869
A cheapskate like you?

744
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,869
A cheapskate does what's 
necessary, Jung Min Jae.

745
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:49,309
 Thanks for the side dishes. 

746
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:50,379
But...

747
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,389
you don't have to do this...

748
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:53,689
As I wrote on the card,

749
00:43:53,689 --> 00:43:56,199
I cleaned out. I didn't waste 
the leftover ingredients.

750
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,409
"Cleaned out"?

751
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:58,899
What do you mean by that?

752
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:02,649
I cleaned out my refrigerator.

753
00:44:02,649 --> 00:44:04,959
I won't send over any more.

754
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:06,279
Don't you worry.

755
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:11,789
I won't ever appear
 in front of you again.

756
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:12,919
So don't worry.

757
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:14,579
 Gosh, thank you. 

758
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:15,779
Thank you, too.

759
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,019
All right then.

760
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,889
What's wrong with me?

761
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:34,549
Why do I say things...

762
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:38,829
to her, that's not in my heart?

763
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:40,889
Geez.

764
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:42,719
What an idiot.

765
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:46,009
Geez, seriously.

766
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:57,809
It's so good.

767
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,699
It's crazy good. Whoa.

768
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:11,509
♫  A beautiful world...  ♫

769
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:26,609
If I wear this to work,

770
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:28,859
would I change a bit?

771
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:43,009
Okay.

772
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:49,549
♫  Let's not live in anger.  ♫

773
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,389
 Park Pil Hong? 

774
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,819
Chairwoman?

775
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:12,919
I heard you met Jung Won.

776
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:14,229
Wow.

777
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:17,279
You sure have great information
 resources, Chairwoman.

778
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:20,849
You hid away Seo Yeon a long time 
ago, and it's come to this.

779
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:23,579
Jung Won and Seo Yeon 
both know about it.

780
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,119
 Know that. 

781
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,059
 Stay down quietly. 

782
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,299
 Got it? 

783
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,689
Chairwoman.

784
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:34,939
I don't think you can yell at me like this.

785
00:46:36,219 --> 00:46:37,219
What?

786
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:38,809
If I open my mouth,

787
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:42,169
my Jung Won might have to
 give up that CEO position.

788
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:43,619
Aren't you scared?

789
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:47,259
What? You punk!

790
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:48,809
So...

791
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:52,709
see me in a good light, Mother-in-law.

792
00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:56,559
 

793
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:03,529
Seo Yeon knows everything now?

794
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,799
Geez...

795
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,039
What should I do?

796
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:10,499
Aigoo, you're working hard.

797
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:12,339
You're working so hard.

798
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:17,629
Aigoo, ma'am.

799
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:19,739
You're working so hard.

800
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:21,029
- Sir.
- My goodness.

801
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:24,379
I'm sorry that I've been 
such a cheapskate.

802
00:47:24,379 --> 00:47:26,059
Don't mention it.

803
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:28,239
I was shortsighted.

804
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:31,419
And as for this mop...

805
00:47:31,419 --> 00:47:33,219
don't mop 100 times with it.

806
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:36,039
If you need to change it out, 
do so whenever you want.

807
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:39,479
I'll make sure that you don't lack any

808
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:41,059
cleaning supplies.

809
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:42,669
- Thank you.
- Aigoo...

810
00:47:42,669 --> 00:47:44,439
I'm always so thankful for your work.

811
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:45,969
Thank you, sir.

812
00:47:45,969 --> 00:47:47,979
- Good day.
- Thank you.

813
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,819
What did the President say to you?

814
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,459
Well?

815
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,229
♫  Hey, look  ♫

816
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:02,139
♫  A beautiful life...  ♫

817
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:03,279
Hi.

818
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:04,479
Excuse me.

819
00:48:04,479 --> 00:48:05,799
Hey!

820
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,779
Wait.

821
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:07,979
Excuse me.

822
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:09,239
Geez!

823
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:10,759
What's going on?

824
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:12,219
Geez.

825
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:14,669
Wait a minute.

826
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:19,909
Are you that scared of me?

827
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:21,709
No, sir.

828
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:23,319
I was in a rush to go to the restroom.

829
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:29,499
I've been so fussy in the past.

830
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:31,079
I'm sorry.

831
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:38,859
I've lived such a busy life.

832
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:40,949
So I couldn't relax and be calm.

833
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:44,719
I know people don't change
 that easily, but...

834
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:46,789
please watch me.

835
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:49,459
I'll try my best.

836
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:51,509
All right then.

837
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:52,809
Aigoo.

838
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:55,109
Yes, sir.

839
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,989
♫  Hey, look  ♫

840
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:02,769
♫  Let's not live in anger  ♫

841
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,209
Why? What's going on?

842
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:09,749
President is strange.

843
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:11,139
What?

844
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:19,029
That's right.

845
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:20,499
Now that I'm wearing this,

846
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,609
I feel like I'm back to being James,

847
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:24,469
and my heart feels warm and kind.

848
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:27,119
Okay.

849
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,249
Woo Jung Hoo.

850
00:49:28,249 --> 00:49:30,519
I'll be born again now.

851
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:02,909
 

852
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:04,489
Woo Jung Hoo?

853
00:50:04,489 --> 00:50:05,719
Yeah.

854
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:08,099
Jung Hoo is completely changed.

855
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:10,229
No matter how upsetting the 
report is during our meeting,

856
00:50:10,229 --> 00:50:11,989
he never gets mad.

857
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:13,899
Really?

858
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:17,349
So, employees are very 
nervous and anxious.

859
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:18,569
Why?

860
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:20,509
Isn't it good that he doesn't 
get angry and has changed?

861
00:50:20,509 --> 00:50:22,969
Because he's so different from before.

862
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:25,049
Noona, by chance...

863
00:50:25,049 --> 00:50:26,379
does Jung Hoo...

864
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:28,439
What?

865
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,459
Say it.

866
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:32,629
By chance...

867
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,439
does he have a terminal 
disease or something?

868
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:36,649
What?

869
00:50:36,649 --> 00:50:38,509
Hey, there's no way.

870
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:40,609
He recently had a complete
 physical exam.

871
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:41,529
Everything was fine.

872
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:42,549
Noona, the thing is...

873
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:45,279
some things don't show up
 during the exam.

874
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:49,009
Do you think he's the only one
 who knows about that?

875
00:50:58,399 --> 00:51:00,559
 Hae Deun, why don't you move
 into the training camp? 

876
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:03,909
 If you don't move in today, 
I'll assume you're not interested. 

877
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:08,269
Gosh, I'm torn.

878
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:20,409
Yes, Mr. Makjang.

879
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:21,799
Why aren't you coming in?

880
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:24,549
The client is coming in.

881
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:25,819
A client?

882
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:29,769
You know the client that we
 worked on for styling last time?

883
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:31,019
She's coming back.

884
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:34,039
She loved the styling you did for her.

885
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:36,159
Really?

886
00:51:37,509 --> 00:51:39,539
 Apart from everything else, 

887
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:42,139
 choose the one that excited you. 

888
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:44,849
Yes, I'll be right there.

889
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:45,999
Yes, well...

890
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:47,369
He... hello?

891
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:52,449
She keeps hanging up on me.

892
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:55,689
She liked my work?

893
00:51:55,689 --> 00:51:56,859
Yay!

894
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:05,599
She followed your styling tip,

895
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,129
and she was totally successful.

896
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:09,269
Her ex-boyfriend is begging 
her to see her again,

897
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:11,819
and he keeps calling her
 day and night.

898
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,339
So she's meeting him again today.

899
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,919
Oh, I see.

900
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:16,729
Thank you for last time.

901
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:19,219
What kind of style do you
 recommend for today?

902
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,339
Do you want to keep 
seeing him again?

903
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,929
You said that he betrayed you.

904
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:26,139
Well, that's true, but...

905
00:52:26,139 --> 00:52:28,349
he keeps asking me out.

906
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,769
He says I look different to him.

907
00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:32,929
His feelings aren't important.

908
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:34,429
Your feelings are important.

909
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:35,899
A man who cheats on you once

910
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:37,389
is bound to cheat on you again.

911
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:40,739
You don't bring in the trash bag
 you tossed before.

912
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:45,509
So today's concept is...

913
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:48,989
Look forward to it.

914
00:52:50,439 --> 00:52:53,029
Totally pathetic looking.

915
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:54,729
Pathetic... what?

916
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:56,899
But that's too...

917
00:52:56,899 --> 00:52:58,909
Be confident, ma'am.

918
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,139
The core issue in styling is in the heart.

919
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,669
Even if you don't get dressed up,

920
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:05,159
in your heart, "I know I'm pretty."

921
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,279
You say that to yourself.

922
00:53:06,279 --> 00:53:08,999
Repeat after me. "I know I'm pretty."

923
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,519
Mr. Makjang, you, too.

924
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,649
Hurry.

925
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:17,169
I can't do it.

926
00:53:17,169 --> 00:53:19,749
I know I'm pretty.

927
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:22,689
Gosh, more arrogantly and conceited.

928
00:53:22,689 --> 00:53:25,099
I know I'm pretty.

929
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:27,199
Like this. Hurry.

930
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:30,929
I know I'm pretty.

931
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:32,409
I know...

932
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,609
- Do I do this with my hand?
- Yeah, you do.

933
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:37,819
Really?

934
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:39,459
You did great.

935
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:40,459
Yes.

936
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:43,279
Director Lee Hae Deun has great taste.

937
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:44,249
Yes.

938
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:45,459
Yes, ma'am.

939
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,029
Come to us again.

940
00:53:47,029 --> 00:53:48,909
Yes. Thank you.

941
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,069
Okay.

942
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:52,119
Did she meet her ex-boyfriend?

943
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:53,209
Yeah.

944
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:55,339
She went out looking totally shabby.

945
00:53:55,339 --> 00:53:58,839
Her ex-boyfriend totally begged
 her to date him again.

946
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:01,159
Our client totally dumped him and left.

947
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:03,369
Daebak!

948
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:04,549
Yeah!

949
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:10,199
I don't want to get physical like this...

950
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:12,879
with people who work together.

951
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:16,809
What the heck? You did it, too.

952
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:18,899
Since the job is finished, I'm leaving.

953
00:54:18,899 --> 00:54:20,599
 What? He's not holding me back? 

954
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,119
I won't hold you back.

955
00:54:31,649 --> 00:54:34,239
Why? Why are you sitting down? I...

956
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,589
I won't hold you back. I won't.

957
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:38,489
I said so. Go now.

958
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:40,789
Okay, okay, okay.

959
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:42,539
What do you want?

960
00:54:44,509 --> 00:54:47,809
I'll give you 5% more 
on the offer I made to you.

961
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:50,489
10%.

962
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,919
You have no conscience.

963
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,199
I don't even get paid.

964
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:58,459
6%?

965
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,799
You're so kind. So kind.

966
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,929
I'll be generous since you're so nice.

967
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:04,849
I'll give you 6.5%.

968
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:05,959
Really?

969
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:08,189
Then you're my employee now.

970
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:09,419
Is that a deal?

971
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:10,659
Deal!

972
00:55:10,659 --> 00:55:12,479
What? What...

973
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:15,159
- Did you just spit?
- Thanks in advance, Mr. Makjang.

974
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:20,089
Don't call me Mr. Makjang now. 
Call me CEO.

975
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:22,309
Why? I like "Mr. Makjang."

976
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:26,049
I wish we don't get touchy 
with people we work with.

977
00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:28,659
 

978
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,579
CEO.

979
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:33,199
I've thought about this a lot. But...

980
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,319
I can't approve of appointing 
Hwang Na Ro as your assistant.

981
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,859
Why not?

982
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:41,239
You know well that Hwang Na Ro
 is good at what he does.

983
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:44,389
CEO!

984
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:51,529
 Hello, I'm Hwang Na Ro. 

985
00:55:51,529 --> 00:55:53,269
 No. 

986
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:55,179
 For some reason, I have a bad feeling. 

987
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:56,419
Director Jang.

988
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,129
Don't be too hasty in your decision.

989
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:01,869
Give him other tasks and
 watch him for now...

990
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:03,179
Mom!

991
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:05,719
You know how much
 I'm struggling these days.

992
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:07,779
Can't you even approve
 this request from me?

993
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:12,589
What do your struggles have anything
 to do with personnel changes?

994
00:56:12,589 --> 00:56:15,579
On top of that, if you decided that 
due to your personal struggles,

995
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:17,209
I can't allow it even more.

996
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:20,739
By chance...

997
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:23,779
do you have other feelings 
toward Hwang Na Ro?

998
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,589
I have a meeting off-site.
 I have to go.

999
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:30,309
If I do...

1000
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:33,419
is that bad?

1001
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,129
Seo Ah.

1002
00:56:36,129 --> 00:56:38,149
Anyway, I'll put Hwang Na Ro...

1003
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:40,229
as my assistant secretary.

1004
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:41,769
No, you can't.

1005
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,859
I won't approve.

1006
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,089
Mom.

1007
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:52,159
Unbelievable.

1008
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,219
You're only an intern.

1009
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:56,999
How dare you lecture me?

1010
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,489
What do you care who I appoint

1011
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,189
as my secretary?

1012
00:57:01,189 --> 00:57:02,649
Seo Ah.

1013
00:57:02,649 --> 00:57:06,339
- Hwang Na Ro isn't trustworthy.
- Bit Chae Woon!

1014
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:09,349
We're at work.

1015
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:11,259
Why don't you speak honorifics to me?

1016
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:12,619
No.

1017
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:16,439
I'm talking to you as your sister.

1018
00:57:16,439 --> 00:57:19,209
What's your reason for wanting to 
keep Hwang Na Ro close?

1019
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:22,609
Do you want Woo Jae Hee
 to worry about you?

1020
00:57:23,419 --> 00:57:25,879
Or do you want to work together

1021
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:28,599
- and kick me out?
- Hey!

1022
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:31,619
You get out.

1023
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:33,679
Get out!

1024
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:36,289
Get out!

1025
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:37,759
You won't get out?

1026
00:57:37,759 --> 00:57:39,289
Get out!

1027
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:43,029
Get out! Get out!

1028
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:45,209
Is anyone out there?

1029
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:46,589
Get her out of here!

1030
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,129
Right now!

1031
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:54,159
Please get out, Bit Chae Woon.

1032
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:57,419
Don't let Bit Chae Woon in here
 without my permission!

1033
00:57:57,509 --> 00:58:00,309
- Got that?
- I'm sorry, Director.

1034
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:03,309
Bit Chae Woon.

1035
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,589
Boss.

1036
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:18,059
Did you hire a part-timer
 for the evenings?

1037
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,969
Yes, he'll be here.

1038
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,789
Oh, yay!

1039
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,689
It's been so hard on me.

1040
00:58:23,689 --> 00:58:25,219
I'm so happy.

1041
00:58:25,939 --> 00:58:28,679
Hello.

1042
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,349
Eems hyung.

1043
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,709
Aigoo, Eems hyung, 
I missed you so much!

1044
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:35,619
I saw you not too long ago.

1045
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:36,909
No, I didn't.

1046
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:38,769
I think it's been about 
100 years since I saw you.

1047
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:39,879
Me, too.

1048
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:42,529
Eems hyung, sit here.

1049
00:58:42,529 --> 00:58:45,179
I'll bring you some delicious jokbal.

1050
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:46,059
No.

1051
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:47,379
I have to work.

1052
00:58:47,379 --> 00:58:48,329
Work?

1053
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,599
Work? What?

1054
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,979
Oh, Eems hyung, right.

1055
00:58:51,979 --> 00:58:53,449
You're a president.

1056
00:58:53,449 --> 00:58:55,009
You must be busy these days.

1057
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:56,589
I'm working here part-time.

1058
00:58:56,609 --> 00:58:58,779
Why would you work part-time here?

1059
00:58:58,779 --> 00:59:02,279
Then you're the new part-timer here?

1060
00:59:02,279 --> 00:59:03,469
Yes.

1061
00:59:03,469 --> 00:59:05,599
Thank you, Boss.

1062
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,259
Thanks in advance.

1063
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:08,149
Sure.

1064
00:59:09,419 --> 00:59:10,749
Why?

1065
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:12,789
You're busy with your business.

1066
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:14,829
You're all dressed up.

1067
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:18,279
Is your business suffering these days?

1068
00:59:18,279 --> 00:59:21,059
Aigoo, are debt collectors
 still chasing you?

1069
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,049
Debt collectors?

1070
00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:25,269
Geez, no, no.

1071
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:28,259
I was just saying as an example.

1072
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:33,009
Just because. I get so lonely at night.

1073
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:36,039
So I get to see you here, Hwak Se.

1074
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,689
I wanted to work happily.

1075
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:40,129
Aigoo, you were lonely.

1076
00:59:40,129 --> 00:59:41,659
Yeah, right.

1077
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:44,079
There's no medicine for loneliness.

1078
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:50,079
Don't tell people here 
about my background.

1079
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,319
Continue to call me James.

1080
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,629
Aigoo, of course.

1081
00:59:55,989 --> 00:59:58,279
Thank you in advance, sunbaenim.

1082
00:59:58,279 --> 01:00:00,019
Gosh, what sunbae?

1083
01:00:00,019 --> 01:00:02,279
Thanks in advance, Eems hyung.

1084
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:03,919
I'm so happy, Eems hyung.

1085
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:05,339
I'm so happy!

1086
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:15,089
Oh, my.

1087
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:20,309
Mr. Woo.

1088
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:23,109
Soon Jung...

1089
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:27,289
Ms. Lee, have you been well?

1090
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:29,819
Yes. What brings you here?

1091
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,199
Have you been well?

1092
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:32,019
Yes.

1093
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,529
Starting today,

1094
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:37,079
I'm working here part-time 
in the evenings.

1095
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:38,269
What?

1096
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:42,309
It's my hobby and recreational.

1097
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:43,739
As something like that.

1098
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:47,489
People work two or 
three jobs these days.

1099
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:49,759
Oh, I see.

1100
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:55,089
How is your health?

1101
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:57,159
Yes, I'm strong.

1102
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:58,959
That's good.

1103
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:03,139
Did the Chairwoman come back...

1104
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:04,999
or something like that?

1105
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:09,199
About that?

1106
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:13,229
Per your advice...

1107
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:15,549
I mustered up the courage.

1108
01:01:15,549 --> 01:01:17,089
I...

1109
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:19,689
was feeling frustrated here.

1110
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:21,509
It's much better now.

1111
01:01:21,509 --> 01:01:22,859
Is that right?

1112
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:25,269
Gosh, I'm glad you did.

1113
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:29,149
It's all thanks to your advice.

1114
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:31,899
Thank you so much.

1115
01:01:31,899 --> 01:01:34,689
Geez, I didn't do anything.

1116
01:01:37,939 --> 01:01:39,659
 Jung Hoo oppa... 

1117
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:42,279
 You worried about me in the past, too, 

1118
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:44,199
 as you smiled like you are now. 

1119
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:51,339
Woo Jung Hoo started working
 for a jokbal place part-time?

1120
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:52,689
Yes.

1121
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:54,709
According to Hwak Se,

1122
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:57,509
Mr. Woo felt lonely to stay home

1123
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:59,079
in the evenings.

1124
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:01,239
So he decided to work two jobs.

1125
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:02,989
Lonely?

1126
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:04,839
 Noona, by chance... 

1127
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:08,889
 does he have a terminal
 disease or something? 

1128
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:12,939
Jung Hoo is feeling lonely?

1129
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:15,339
Could he really be sick?

1130
01:02:18,389 --> 01:02:21,339
Okay, here is soju and beer.

1131
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:25,209
Enjoy. Enjoy...

1132
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:28,209
- Woo Jung Hoo is totally James.
- Enjoy.

1133
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:31,389
Oh, no.

1134
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:33,519
Thank you. Come again.

1135
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,979
Oh, my gosh!

1136
01:02:55,959 --> 01:02:58,829
I didn't come to see you.

1137
01:02:58,829 --> 01:03:00,069
I came to see Jae Hee.

1138
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:04,899
Why do you do this with me?

1139
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,589
Jung Min Jae.

1140
01:03:10,459 --> 01:03:12,719
You're too much.

1141
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:15,319
What?

1142
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:19,159
You are...

1143
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:21,539
just too much.

1144
01:03:31,509 --> 01:03:33,509
 - What could it be?
- There's something there. 

1145
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:35,019
 Oh, my gosh. 

1146
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,209
 Then by chance... 

1147
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:38,409
 could Bit Chae Woon, Hwang Na Ro... 

1148
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:40,069
 and Director Jang Seo Ah 

1149
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:41,599
 be in a love triangle? 

1150
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,179
That's how it looked to me.

1151
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:45,499
Director Jang totally got pissed off

1152
01:03:45,499 --> 01:03:48,029
that she yelled at Bit Chae Woon 
and threw a fit.

1153
01:03:48,029 --> 01:03:49,689
Doesn't Bit Chae Woon 
have a boyfriend?

1154
01:03:49,689 --> 01:03:51,399
I think I saw him in front 
of our building.

1155
01:03:52,459 --> 01:03:54,269
 Something is definitely strange
 about Bit Chae Woon. 

1156
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:56,719
 That article that came up
 on our blog, too. 

1157
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:58,279
 Right, Chief? 

1158
01:04:00,009 --> 01:04:01,549
 What could it be? 

1159
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:19,499
Hi, Koala. Traffic jam?

1160
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:24,219
Yeah, I left a little late, 
and there's so much traffic.

1161
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:25,679
Sorry, Moong-i.

1162
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:28,309
No, I can wait.

1163
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:30,639
I want to see you soon.

1164
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:33,269
Then let's talk until I get there.

1165
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,649
Focus on your driving.

1166
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:37,319
 There's not much to focus. 

1167
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,369
All the cars are stopped.

1168
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:41,649
No, focus.

1169
01:04:41,649 --> 01:04:44,269
Take your time. I can wait.

1170
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:45,289
I'm hanging up.

1171
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:46,769
 Wait, wait, wait. 

1172
01:04:47,399 --> 01:04:48,309
What?

1173
01:04:49,249 --> 01:04:51,019
Why don't you give me a kiss?

1174
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,539
My goodness.

1175
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:56,219
Hurry.

1176
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,689
There.

1177
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:02,959
Did you kiss?

1178
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:04,669
I couldn't hear anything.

1179
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:09,319
Is that good?

1180
01:05:12,029 --> 01:05:14,779
I'll be right there. Wait just a little bit.

1181
01:05:14,779 --> 01:05:16,599
Gosh, take your time.

1182
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:18,109
I can wait.

1183
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:19,269
Bye.

1184
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:25,199
There's too much traffic.

1185
01:05:40,429 --> 01:05:42,139
Did you follow me?

1186
01:05:46,929 --> 01:05:48,699
Do you have something to say to me?

1187
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:56,869
What is it?

1188
01:05:59,379 --> 01:06:02,449
Why do you keep blocking my path?

1189
01:06:05,889 --> 01:06:07,489
About what happened earlier?

1190
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:12,269
What makes you think that is
 how I'm blocking your path?

1191
01:06:13,129 --> 01:06:15,569
I'm doing that because 
Seo Ah is in danger.

1192
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:19,339
Since when did you care so 
much about Jang Seo Ah?

1193
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:23,389
You took away everything
 Jang Seo Ah had.

1194
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:28,399
Did Seo Ah brainwash you?

1195
01:06:28,399 --> 01:06:30,479
How can you two say that to me?

1196
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:31,639
Anyway...

1197
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:35,359
don't keep blocking my path.

1198
01:06:36,989 --> 01:06:38,449
I beg you.

1199
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:42,739
And if I do?

1200
01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:45,589
If you do?

1201
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:50,529
Then I'll block your path, too.

1202
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,369
Hwang Na Ro, you're already...

1203
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:59,099
doing your best to block 
my path. Aren't you?

1204
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:02,579
Through foul means.

1205
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:07,019
What are you doing right now?

1206
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:11,139
If you stop me in a spot where
 there aren't many people,

1207
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:14,439
did you think I'd even blink?

1208
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:17,829
Why do you pretend to be so strong?

1209
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:20,319
Pretending to be strong even if 
you're on the verge of dying.

1210
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,689
Everything I do might've 
been seen as a lie to you.

1211
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:26,149
But I was genuine toward 
you, Bit Chae Woon.

1212
01:07:26,149 --> 01:07:27,779
But just because you know 
about my past,

1213
01:07:27,779 --> 01:07:30,179
you judge me and look 
at me as if I'm a worm.

1214
01:07:30,209 --> 01:07:33,309
Why do you keep denying me 
and look down on me? Why?

1215
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:35,669
Why do you keep saying, no? Why?

1216
01:07:36,769 --> 01:07:37,929
Hey!

1217
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,309
What is this jerk doing right now?

1218
01:07:45,459 --> 01:07:46,869
Are you okay?

1219
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:48,769
Mr. Lee.

1220
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:49,969
Aigoo.

1221
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,709
Thank you.

1222
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:19,429
♫  Since when was it?  ♫

1223
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,419
♫  Without knowing  ♫

1224
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:25,489
Seo Yeon.

1225
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:30,269
♫  I'm looking at my gloomy heart  ♫

1226
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:33,009
♫  As I've always done  ♫

1227
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:39,309
♫  I was afraid that I might get hurt  ♫

1228
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:46,009
♫  I couldn't go to you, 
and I'd only imagine  ♫

1229
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:49,849
♫  I only think of you  ♫

1230
01:08:49,849 --> 01:08:54,149
♫  I can't do anything  ♫

1231
01:08:54,209 --> 01:09:00,179
♫  I try to let go of my regrets, 
but it keeps getting worse  ♫

1232
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:03,829
♫  Closer you get to me  ♫

1233
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:11,269
♫  I'm afraid you might catch how I feel  ♫

1234
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:16,699
♫  I look at you from a distance  ♫

1235
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:18,199
 

1236
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:21,259
 Whenever I appear, he turns 
into the old Woo Jung Hoo. 

1237
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:23,559
 - Where is the trash bag?
- Where I always keep them. 

1238
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:27,529
 Jung Min Jae, why did you 
bring that with you? 

1239
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,419
 Where is the dictionary I put here? 

1240
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:31,869
 Scared me. Did Dad come here? 

1241
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:34,129
 You should take off 
your socks and sleep. 

1242
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:35,819
 James? 

1243
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,589
 Be quiet. 

1244
01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:39,089
 - No manners.
- Hey. 

1245
01:09:39,089 --> 01:09:41,339
 Why are you here? Jang Joon Ah. 

1246
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:43,749
 Pick up your mom and 
bring your siblings. 

1247
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:45,989
 Thank you for taking care of them. 

1248
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:47,649
 No, Mom. 

1249
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:50,479
 This is the picture of CEO Kim Jung Won's
 hidden daughter Lee Bit Chae Woon. 

1250
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,039
 Please be honest with us now. 

1251
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:54,259
 Is it true that you have
 a daughter you're hiding? 

1252
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:56,323
♫  I can't do anything  ♫
