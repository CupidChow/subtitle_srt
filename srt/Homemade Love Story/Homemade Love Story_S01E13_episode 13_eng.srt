1
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,740
Who are you?

2
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,440
Father!

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,090
Pardon?

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,350
F... Father!

5
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,240
I... I'm James.

6
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,050
- Fa...
 - I'm... I'm... I'm sorry!

7
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,910
Wait, be careful.

8
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,280
Be careful!

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,540
Father...

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,860
Father!

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,790
Father! Be careful!

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,650
James hyung!

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,850
James hyung, what's wrong?

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,320
- The creditor...
- Why are you running away?

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,090
Aigoo, James hyung!

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,610
Is he sick? Is he? I'll call 911.

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,800
No, no. It's not that bad.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,310
Hey, James hyung.

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,480
He lives in the room 
next door. It's okay.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,910
James...

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,300
James?

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,330
- Hyungnim, so he's...
- You were shocked, huh?

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,470
Geez, it's a long story.

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,180
Well, we ended up 
taking care of him.

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,880
He lost his memory 
from an accident.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,450
He barely remembers his name.

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,940
It's James.

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,580
What?

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,830
You're...

30
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,240
that good looking guy
 in the picture.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,260
I scared you, right?

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,410
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,230
This is a dream.

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,480
Hyungnim, this is a dream, right?

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,720
No, Mr. Woo. It's not 
a dream. It's real.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,210
Oh, this is a dream.

37
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,030
What a weird dream.

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,780
Hey, wake up!

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,720
Hey, Mr. Woo...

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,140
I guess he also hurt...

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,360
over here, huh?

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,150
 

43
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,110
This is a dream.

44
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm dreaming because I put 
all the blame on Father.

45
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,800
Woo Jae Hee, let's wake up.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,280
Let's wake up.

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,620
Wake up!

48
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,460
Hyungnim!

49
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,710
It was a dream.

50
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,890
I guess I dozed off.

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,280
Geez, can't believe what
 a sucky dream that was.

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,990
I have to get to the 
construction site.

53
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,890
I came by to pick up 
my documents...

54
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,170
and came into the house...

55
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,710
Then this is...

56
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,620
Right, Jae Hee.

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,000
This isn't a dream.

58
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,100
Geez, Eems hyung, come on.

59
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,730
Aigoo!

60
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,860
Geez, Jae Hee. You sure 
seem shocked big time.

61
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,770
You're not this fragile, 
to begin with.

62
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,830
It's probably because
 I came out of his wardrobe.

63
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,680
His wardrobe?

64
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,350
- Yes.
- Geez, Eems hyung!

65
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,740
Why did you come out of there?

66
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,480
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,470
 Thank you! 

68
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,630
 Good job! You did great! 

69
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,300
Good job!

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,370
Bit Chae Woon, you were 
stunning! The best!

71
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,930
Thank you, CEO.

72
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,840
I'll go help out.

73
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,940
Young Lady Jung Won.

74
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,470
Soon Jung, you made it.

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,460
I thought you didn't come 
since your seat was empty.

76
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,430
I came a little late.

77
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,670
Thank you so much for coming.

78
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,310
Did you enjoy the show?

79
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,000
Mom!

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,900
I thought you didn't 
make it, Mom.

81
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,590
Mom?

82
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,080
CEO, this is my mom.

83
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,060
Mom, our CEO.

84
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,370
The one I totally like.

85
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,860
Wait...

86
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,420
Bit Chae Woon is...

87
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,530
your daughter, Soon Jung?

88
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,070
Excuse me?

89
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,650
I also found out not too long ago.

90
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,970
That Chae Woon's...

91
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,560
company CEO is you, Young Lady.

92
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,710
Mom, do you know our CEO?

93
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,030
Yeah.

94
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,670
We go way back.

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,540
What in the world.

96
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,090
Wait.

97
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,900
Bit Chae Woon is your 
daughter, Soon Jung?

98
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,410
My gosh.

99
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,820
Oh, my gosh!

100
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,260
No wonder I liked 
Bit Chae Woon so much.

101
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,650
This is so neat. Right?

102
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,960
Yes.

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,550
CEO.

104
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,210
Seo Ah.

105
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,050
Soon Jung is here.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Hello.

107
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,620
Thank you for helping us out
 with our home party.

108
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,520
Don't mention it.

109
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,060
Well...

110
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,740
Soon Jung is... no...

111
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,490
Bit Chae Woon is... wait, no.

112
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,500
Gosh, I guess I'm in shock.
 I can't speak.

113
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,940
- Director, she's...
- I'm...

114
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,840
Bit Chae Woon's mom.

115
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,110
I found out when I went 
to your house recently.

116
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,060
But I couldn't tell you at the time.

117
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,320
- I was so taken aback.
- Right.

118
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,090
You must've been so 
shocked as well.

119
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,320
Mother Soon Jung is quite bold.

120
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,370
Why is she doing 
something so drastic?

121
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,500
I'll have to revise my plan.

122
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,910
Chae Woon.

123
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,240
You were taken aback earlier, huh?

124
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,750
When I worked at Yeonhuidong 
madam's house party,

125
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,860
I ran into the CEO there.

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,240
A long time ago, when I used
 to work as a housemaid,

127
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,490
she lived next door.

128
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,710
I see.

129
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,470
That's what I thought.

130
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,760
And she asked me to help her 
with a party at her house,

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,750
so I went over to her house once.

132
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,200
Aigoo.

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,010
How did you hide the fact that 
you ran into Jang Seo Ah then?

134
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,230
You were worried that
 I'd get mad, huh?

135
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,600
Gosh.

136
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,370
My mom must've been so upset.

137
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,810
You can't even lie at all.

138
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,200
Because of the position I'm in,

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,140
does it make you 
feel uncomfortable?

140
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,040
I still address the CEO 
as a "young lady."

141
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,770
No, not at all.

142
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,290
You can address her 
like that out of habit.

143
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,180
It's too weird to call her 
"Jung Won" after all that time.

144
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,740
 I just felt bad for you. 

145
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,680
 You must've suffered so much
 at such a young age. 

146
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,900
Let's go.

147
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,230
Hi, Min Suk. I'm done taking notes.

148
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,350
Yeah, okay. I'll keep that in mind.

149
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,760
 

150
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,550
Then I can open up a branch
 sooner than expected?

151
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,620
 Yeah. 

152
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,700
You showed strong 
determination last time,

153
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
so things worked out well.

154
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,440
That's great!

155
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,130
Of course.

156
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,720
Gosh, come on.

157
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,450
  The customer is not
 answering the phone. 

158
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,440
Where did Min Jae go? 
She's not answering.

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,350
You said you bumped 
into her earlier, right?

160
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,930
Yes, in the front.

161
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,280
I'll get going then.

162
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,240
- I have to finish up the event.
- Director Jang.

163
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,300
Soon Jung.

164
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,070
It's out of the blue, 
and it's way too late.

165
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,850
But we'll apologize.

166
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,500
About the incident when 
Bit Chae Woon was in middle school.

167
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,500
Seo Ah.

168
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,720
You hear everything from 
Bit Chae Woon, right?

169
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,890
Seo Ah was immature then.

171
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,510
She was wrong in doing that.

172
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,420
I'm sorry, Soon Jung.

173
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,830
We apologized to Bit Chae Woon.

174
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,960
 I'm so sorry, Teacher. 

175
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,710
 I didn't do anything wrong! 

176
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,540
 Stay put! 

177
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,140
 Teacher, I'm so... 

178
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,700
 My Chae Woon... 

179
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,740
 went through... 

180
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,640
so much back then.

181
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,340
But she got through it bravely.

182
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,500
That's right.

183
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,730
You raised your daughter so well.

184
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,340
Gosh, no.

185
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,870
I didn't do anything for her.

186
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,940
My Chae Woon...

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,570
is too good...

188
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,650
She's too good for me.

189
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,310
Anyway...

190
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,090
we got to clear things up like this.

191
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,340
I'm so glad that things 
worked out well.

192
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,540
Please take good care 
of my Chae Woon.

193
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
Sure.

194
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,260
I'll get going then.

195
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,550
All right.

196
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,590
Find out where 
Min Jae ahjumma is.

197
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,690
Okay.

198
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Why did Mom have to
 bring up the past?

199
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,820
 Who is it? 

200
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,510
 An old friend had given it to me. 

201
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,640
Then that photo...

202
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,860
is from that ahjumma?

203
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,010
Why did Mom keep
 that so tightly then?

204
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,440
It's like it's her daughter's picture.

205
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,180
My Seo Ah is pretty
 particular, huh?

206
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,770
She takes after me.

207
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,530
Oh, no.

208
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,360
You're such a warm 
person, Young Lady.

209
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,250
Gosh, seriously.

210
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,620
I told you to call me "unni."

211
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,690
Oh, but...

212
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,490
if Bit Chae Woon and Seo Ah were

213
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,550
classmates...

214
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,020
Soon Jung, you weren't...

215
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,190
married then, though.

216
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,240
What's wrong?

217
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,870
Are you okay? Here.

218
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,000
Geez.

220
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,810
Could I give it a try?

221
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,100
Gosh, what do I do?

222
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,680
I have so many places to go today.

223
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,020
By chance, did you attend our event?

224
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,960
Yes.

225
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,060
If you're okay with it,

226
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,590
should I bring you something
 you can change into?

227
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,180
Oh, I'm a design team 
employee here.

228
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,100
I'll bring you something that 
will suit you from our line.

229
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,960
Would that be okay?

230
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
Of course.

231
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll be right back. 
Give me a moment.

232
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,700
This and...

233
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,840
a skirt...

234
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,790
Okay.

235
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,190
 
Mother, where are you right now?

236
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,030
Okay.

237
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,690
Bit Chae Woon!

238
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,300
Give me that and get back to work.

239
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,790
- There's a client in the ladies' room...
- I know.

240
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,530
She's my boyfriend's mother.

241
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,770
Carry on.

242
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,640
All right.

243
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,980
Score lots of points then.

244
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,750
My gosh! It's a perfect fit.

245
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,860
It's a cute style that
 suits me well.

246
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,960
Where is that smiley 
young lady from earlier?

247
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,450
Ah...

248
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,010
She went back to work.

249
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,320
She's busy.

250
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,900
Gosh, I didn't even 
get to thank her.

251
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,970
Gosh, she's got a good eye.

252
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,480
I picked these out.

253
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,860
I was in the design office, and she 
was looking for an outfit hurriedly.

254
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,450
Oh, I see.

255
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,170
Of course, that's the case.

256
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,740
Seo Ah, you have 
such a great eye.

257
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,240
Thanks.

258
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,650
 I'll pretend to fall for your lie. 

259
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,890
Young Lady.

260
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,990
To be honest...

261
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,160
my Chae Woon is...

262
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,320
- Chae Woon...
- You don't have to tell me if it's hard.

263
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,000
Chairwoman.

264
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,020
Please let me...

265
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,340
tell Young Lady Jung Won
 everything honestly.

266
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,650
 That's nonsense! 

267
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,550
 Are you trying to cut the ties 
between Jung Won and me? 

268
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,560
I can't stand this any longer.

269
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,080
Please let me reveal everything

270
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,960
and send back Chae Woon

271
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,840
to his birth mom.

272
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,440
Soon Jung, you've 
done well all this time.

273
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,680
To Seo Yeon, no...

274
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,650
You said it's Bit Chae Woon, right?

275
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,950
Do you really want to

276
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,460
tell that child

277
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,550
 that her grandma abandoned her? 

278
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,970
 Do you want to reveal what 
an evil man her birth dad is 

279
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,540
 and put a stake through her heart? 

280
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,730
 It's already too late. 

281
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,170
 If you don't want to
 ruin Bit Chae Woon, 

282
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,720
 you keep your mouth shut. 

283
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,890
 It will be over if 
you carry the burden. 

284
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,090
 Why are you trying to 
dig up everything now? 

285
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,680
Back then...

286
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,210
After I quit working for 
Young Lady Min Jae's family,

287
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,530
while I worked in a factory,

288
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,040
while I worked at an orphanage,

289
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,310
I met my husband there.

290
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,290
When I married him,

291
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,900
I came to live with my Chae Woon.

292
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,350
That's what happened.

293
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,220
That's what happened to me, too.

294
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,940
My Seo Ah...

295
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,000
is my second husband's daughter.

296
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh, I see.

297
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,670
In some ways, we have 
so much in common.

298
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,120
Our loved ones passed
 on before us,

299
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,460
and even though we didn't 
give birth to them ourselves,

300
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,300
we're raising our precious
 daughters in love.

301
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,080
 She must think... 

302
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,360
 my Chae Woon is my
 husband's daughter. 

303
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,140
Soon Jung.

304
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,320
You must've struggled
 so much all this time.

305
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,360
Don't mention it.

306
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,950
Actually, my Chae Woon is...

307
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,400
Chae...

308
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,740
Huh?

309
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,760
What are you two doing holding
 hands so affectionately?

310
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,420
We were badmouthing you.

311
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,690
What?

312
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,260
Hey, where did you go? 
I called you so many times.

313
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,940
Worked on my business

314
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,500
and gained an outfit.

315
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,820
Hey, it looks great on you.

316
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,980
- Isn't it cute?
- You look so pretty.

317
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,680
Lee Hae Deun?

318
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,660
Please work hard starting today.

319
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,470
Yes, I'll work hard.

320
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,500
Please address the
 customers politely.

321
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,440
 There are lots of entertainment 
agencies around here. 

322
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,430
 I think I can get picked 
up working here. 

323
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,880
 - Catch two birds with one stone. 
- I'd appreciate that.

324
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,820
Okay.

325
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,650
Whoa, it's a busy day.

326
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,650
 

327
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,150
 
A sandwich place?

328
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,430
Okay.

329
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,940
- Please warm it up.
- Yes, will do.

330
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,350
Hae Deun.

331
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,280
Delivery pick-up will 
come by for this.

332
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,850
Oh, okay.

333
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,790
Welcome.

334
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,080
Mister, it's ready to go.

335
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,870
Mister!

336
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,850
What should I do? I have to
 hurry up and deliver it.

337
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,190
 She said she got a new 
part-time job. But here? 

338
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,980
♫  The yellow cafe I see over there  ♫
The helmet.

339
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,540
Why didn't I think of my helmet?

340
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,060
♫  I'm running toward that place  ♫

341
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,160
It's weird.

342
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,410
It was the delivery man, 
but he just left.

343
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,450
I'm here to pick up a sandwich.

344
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,720
Here you go.

345
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,030
 Lee Hae Deun unni? 

346
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,310
Good day!

347
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,170
Whoa, a woman delivery.

348
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,460
So cool.

349
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,380
Let's just go.

350
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,390
♫  Should I give her a rose?  ♫

351
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,330
Hi.

352
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,780
Hey, Cha Ba Reun.

353
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,390
♫  What should I say and how?  ♫

354
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,140
Why are you here?

355
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,490
♫  All I can think about is her  ♫

356
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,240
♫  And I think she's approaching me  ♫

357
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,620
♫  Are the clouds in
 the sky cotton candy?  ♫

358
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,810
We should hurry.

359
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,740
Hey, get down.

360
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,470
Are you going to be late?

361
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,020
I guess I can't be late.

362
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,630
♫  I will muster up the courage  ♫

363
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,220
♫  I will confess my
 feelings to her today  ♫

364
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,860
♫  I will muster up the courage  ♫

365
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,360
Hold on tight.

366
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,900
♫  I will muster up the courage  ♫

367
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,440
Soon Jung, even though 
we're meeting after a long time,

368
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,330
it feels like I just met you yesterday.

369
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,430
Maybe because we 
lived together then.

370
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,860
Yes. You're right.

371
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,950
Let's get together with 
Jung Won often in the future.

372
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,680
Yes.

373
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,090
 What's going on? 

374
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,750
 Why does she look so uneasy? 

375
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,170
 Is she still feeling 
uncomfortable with me? 

376
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,040
 Because I took your first love? 

377
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,930
I have to take the bus over there.

378
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,900
Oh, okay.

379
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,420
Be careful going home.

380
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,980
- See you again, Soon Jung.
- Yes.

381
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,560
Goodbye.

382
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,350
Wait...

383
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,440
What?

384
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,380
The president is doing well, right?

385
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,190
 Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. 
Look at her. 

386
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,270
 Look at this. 

387
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,770
 Does Soon Jung still have lingering
 feelings for Woo Jung Hoo? 

388
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,260
Yeah...

389
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,280
my husband is well.

390
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,660
He's busy with work.

391
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,960
He's still very cut and dry as usual.

392
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,630
Speaking of the devil.

393
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,130
Yes, Honey.

394
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,040
It's me.

395
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,930
Yes, it just ended.

396
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,340
I'm on my way.

397
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,850
Noona, it's me.

398
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,030
Noona?

399
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,400
 As expected... 

400
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,390
 James is really James. 

401
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,270
I'm so childish.

402
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,750
Why pretend to get along with Woo Jung Hoo
 now that we're finished?

403
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,340
 It's okay. 

404
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,900
 It's a gift. 

405
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,370
But how can I not? 
When I think of our past?

406
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,740
 Noona! Hello? 

407
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,090
 Noona! 

408
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,570
Why?

409
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,320
What?

410
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,750
Father must be missing work.

411
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,610
Why did Uncle say...

412
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,960
 - Is Father doing well?
- What? 

413
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,230
 Yeah, of course. 

414
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,390
 Jung Hoo is full of energy. 

415
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,530
 Jae Hee! 

416
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,280
Jae Hee, Jung Hoo is...

417
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,130
- Did Father go somewhere?
- Huh?

418
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,120
Oh, well, as for that...

419
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,420
Is something going 
on with Father?

420
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,900
No, that's not it.

421
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,490
Geez...

422
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,080
Actually...

423
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,190
Jung Hoo took some time off.

424
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,750
After the divorce, I guess
 he was feeling down.

425
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,610
He asked to keep it a secret 
from the employees.

426
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,750
Mr. Jung.

427
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,960
- Jae Hee, you're here.
- Hello, Chief.

428
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,680
- Uncle. 
- Huh?

429
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,940
Are you staying in 
touch with Father?

430
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,650
Of course. I just spoke to him.

431
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,010
- Right, Chief?
- Pardon?

432
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,390
- Uncle.
- What?

433
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,030
Father is...

434
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,990
- Right now, Father is...
- Don't worry.

435
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,330
Jung Hoo usually 
doesn't answer your calls.

436
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,820
You know his temper.

437
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,550
It seems no one 
knows about him yet.

438
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,640
Uncle...

439
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,250
It's easy sailing since
 Father isn't there, huh?

440
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,020
 

441
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,120
 You shouldn't tell your mother 
about anything of concern for now. 

442
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,640
It might worsen her depression.

443
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,950
 
Geez...

444
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,910
Hi, Seo Ah.

445
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,540
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

446
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,300
We had our showcase event today.
 Your mom came, too.

447
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,670
Oppa, come and let's 
have dinner together.

448
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,990
 Okay? Oppa... 

449
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,000
After having dinner together,
 you can drive Mother home.

450
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,940
Mother will be so happy.

451
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,670
Mother seems a bit lonely.

452
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,870
Oh, really?

453
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,370
All right then. I'll wrap up and go.

454
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,500
Okay, Oppa. See you later.

455
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,750
Director Jang.

456
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,140
There's an after-party for 
the design team tonight, right?

457
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,280
It won't be fun if I join, huh?

458
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,410
Let's have dinner separately 
with Min Jae ahjumma.

459
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,630
I invited Jae Hee oppa.

460
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,840
Min Jae left, saying 
she had a lot to do.

461
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,930
Really?

462
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,770
I guess it would be uncomfortable.

463
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,540
I should know when not to join
 if I want them to say I'm cool.

464
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,560
Get back to work.

465
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,070
Oh, CEO!

466
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,500
You know that baby picture?

467
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,400
I guess that makes 
the baby Bit Chae Woon?

468
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,130
What?

469
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,090
You said someone you knew in the 
past gave you that baby picture.

470
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,410
So the person I knew in the past is 
either Min Jae or Soon Jung?

471
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,800
Are you saying you know
 I don't have many friends?

472
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,420
That's not what I meant.

473
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,260
What can I tell you? It's not.

474
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,500
Yes, Chairman.

475
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,790
Carry on.

476
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,510
Oh, yes.

477
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,790
 Because of the position I'm in, 

478
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,260
 does it make you
 feel uncomfortable? 

479
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,480
 I still address the CEO
 as a "young lady." 

480
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,170
Gosh.

481
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,080
Why does Mom think that?

482
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,100
Hi, Mom.

483
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,860
Are you on your way home?

484
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,510
I went grocery shopping 
and am headed home.

485
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,420
You looked amazing today, 
my daughter.

486
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,070
I'm so proud of you.

487
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,770
Mom, you're amazing, too.

488
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,360
I noticed today that you're 
much prettier than the CEO.

489
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,730
Aigoo.

490
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,120
That's nonsense.

491
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,670
You have work dinner?

492
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,050
Okay.

493
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,370
Be careful coming home later.

494
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,600
- We're off.
- Let's go.

495
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,910
- I heard we're eating meat.
- All right.

496
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,340
Bit Chae Woon, let's go to dinner.

497
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,940
Yes, I'll be there to 
eat some meat.

498
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,880
Na Ro, aren't you going to dinner?

499
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,450
I have to finish the briefing 
files by tomorrow. Go ahead.

500
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,570
Let me see it.

501
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,840
I see.

502
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,960
You're done once you review it.

503
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,690
- Let's do it together.
- I know.

504
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,330
I'll do it quickly.

505
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,840
Geez...

506
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,280
We should be loyal to each 
other as Samgwang people.

507
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,410
Really?

508
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,650
Oh, my. Mr. Woo 
must've been stunned.

509
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,490
Gosh, don't even mention it.

510
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,640
Both James and 
Mr. Woo were stunned.

511
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,430
We almost called 911.

512
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,780
Oh, my gosh.

513
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,560
I don't think this 
will work, Hwak Se.

514
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,790
Now that it's come to this,

515
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,400
let's just reveal it.

516
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,890
Reveal?

517
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,290
Yeah.

518
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,230
Let's tell the Samgwang
 family about James,

519
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,970
and let's think of a solution.

520
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,490
True. I think James is preparing
 himself to reveal everything.

521
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,960
Yes.

522
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,390
It won't solve anything by 
keep hiding him like this.

523
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,260
Keep hiding what, Unni?

524
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,920
Aigoo, Aunt. You always appear 
at the most crucial moment.

525
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,390
Be honest with me.

526
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,090
Were you hiding over 
there eavesdropping,

527
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,230
and did you decide to appear
 at the most crucial moment?

528
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,320
- At such a killer moment?
- Yeah, right.

529
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,680
Unni, I'm home.

530
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,220
Man Jung.

531
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,530
Yeah?

532
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,350
You know, Noonim...

533
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,870
To choose Aunt as the 
second person to open up

534
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,200
is a very tough decision...

535
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,800
Shush!

536
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Unni, what? Tell me.

537
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,380
Well, hello. I'm James.

538
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,050
Man Jung.

539
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,610
James doesn't have 
his memory right now.

540
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,790
No! Don't call the police.

541
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,010
Aunt, hear me out and...

542
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,970
Man Jung!

543
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,150
Hey, Man Jung, listen to us.

544
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,040
Actually, Jame is...

545
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,430
Hey, move.

546
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,130
Please have a seat.

547
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,520
Pardon?

548
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm a doctor.

549
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,860
Let me take a quick look.

550
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,050
Have a seat. You can relax.

551
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,960
Okay.

552
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,970
Sit.

553
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,860
I'll measure your temperature.

554
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,110
You're good.

555
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,240
Please breathe. You're fine.

556
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,630
Let me check your blood pressure.

557
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,000
Don't move.

558
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,040
 This woman is so cool. 

559
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,290
Just breathe.

560
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,240
I'll listen to your heartbeat.

561
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,230
Who are you?

562
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,040
My gosh. He has PTSD.

563
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,630
James.

564
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,920
James, it's okay.

565
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,440
It's my daughter.

566
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,010
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

567
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,170
- Sit up.
- Okay.

568
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,020
I'm home.

569
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,440
- It's okay.
- Did I do something wrong?

570
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,240
It's okay.

571
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,920
James, it's okay.

572
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,500
Sit up. It's okay.

573
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,630
All right. It's okay.

574
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,600
Whoa, amnesia?

575
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,860
Is this a drama or something?

576
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,010
Wow, it's a bit romantic.

577
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,380
My gosh. Romantic? 
This is serious.

578
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,720
Based on my examination, 
he seems to be fine.

579
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,050
But since he's showing 
signs of amnesia,

580
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,380
he should go to the hospital tomorrow
 and get a thorough exam.

581
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,350
I know a specialist. I'll talk to him.

582
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,950
Okay.

583
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,320
But to do that,

584
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,760
shouldn't we report this
 to the police first?

585
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,560
You should, Unni.

586
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,080
Unni.

587
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,760
No matter how much 
he pleaded with you,

588
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,150
how can you hide him for days?

589
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,830
Gosh, still.

590
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,450
James was so scared.

591
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,370
Hwak Se.

592
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,620
Yes.

593
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,170
- Yes?
- Are you feeling okay?

594
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,090
Uncle, you're blushing.

595
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,380
- Do you have a fever?
- Me?

596
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,660
- Am I turning red?
- Let me see.

597
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,470
Is it hot in here?

598
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,900
Right.

599
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,430
I shouldn't reveal it yet.

600
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,940
Hi, Hwak Se hyungnim. It's me.

601
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,110
Father...

602
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,400
How is he doing?

603
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,910
What?

604
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,660
Since he's out in the open,

605
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,190
we're about to report 
this to the police.

606
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,160
But he doesn't want that, though.

607
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,590
Well, yeah, that's true, but...

608
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,710
but looking at this long-term,

609
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,236
 - we should report this now... 
- Then I'll report.

610
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,226
What?

611
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,156
 My friend is a cop. 

612
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:51,406
 Tomorrow, I'll take Father... 

613
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,886
I'll take James with me...

614
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:56,216
to make a report and 
take him to a doctor.

615
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:59,296
But you're busy, Mr. Woo. 
We'll just do it.

616
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,476
 You said he's on the run. 

617
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:04,386
 We should respect James' position. 

618
00:34:04,386 --> 00:34:06,056
Yeah.

619
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:08,206
That is true.

620
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:11,456
I also know how that feels.

621
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:12,776
I've been on the run, too.

622
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:15,646
The creditors from 
a long time ago, Mom?

623
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:19,116
Gosh, I feel sorry for that ahjussi.

624
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:22,866
I think Jae Hee hyung has a point.

625
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:25,706
Let's do that then.

626
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:27,556
It's too late tonight,

627
00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:30,586
and his anxiety might get worse 
after we make the report.

628
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:31,706
Okay?

629
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:34,756
Then, shall we do that, Mr. Woo?

630
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:36,176
Yes.

631
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:50,466
The handsome young man
 is so thoughtful.

632
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,056
Gosh, my tummy.

633
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:12,976
 

634
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:16,506
I can't help it.

635
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:21,026
Hello.

636
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:24,796
Are you her daughter?

637
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:27,636
You heard, right? I'm James.

638
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:30,226
Hi.

639
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:32,876
I have to use the men's room.

640
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:35,186
Wait...

641
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,866
Geez, this is nuts.

642
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:46,466
He keeps sleeping. 
He must be exhausted.

643
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,096
- He must be up.
- Let's say hi.

644
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:55,066
Hey, hey. How do I look? Pretty?

645
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,266
Joon Woo, are you sleeping?

646
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:13,566
My sister wants to say hi to you.

647
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:16,366
Hello. Sorry for saying hi so late.

648
00:36:16,366 --> 00:36:18,976
I'm the second daughter 
of this family.

649
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,826
This used to be my room.

650
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,926
Since you were so desperate to
 move into Samgwang Villa,

651
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:27,826
I gave it up for you. 
Isn't that great?

652
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:36,186
I don't think you're sleeping.

653
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:37,706
Let's introduce ourselves properly.

654
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,026
We're roommates sharing the room.

655
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:40,786
Even if I'm in the attic
 and you're here.

656
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:46,926
Well, he must be super shy.

657
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,646
You're taking some time off 
from Seohan University, right?

658
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:51,726
My brother is a student there, too.

659
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:54,026
Oh, yeah. I'm Lee Hae Deun.

660
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,766
Thank you in advance.

661
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,636
This is so weird.

662
00:36:57,636 --> 00:37:00,046
Does he have social phobia 
or something?

663
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:02,526
I don't think so. Uncle Hwak Se
 said he's very sociable.

664
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:03,996
- Really?
- Yeah.

665
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:05,866
I'm so curious now.

666
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:07,526
Excuse me.

667
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,506
Let's say hi.

668
00:37:09,506 --> 00:37:11,896
Hello. Hello?

669
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:16,646
Let's stop for now and 
say hi next time.

670
00:37:16,646 --> 00:37:19,026
Gosh, I can't stand being curious.

671
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:20,796
Excuse me.

672
00:37:20,796 --> 00:37:22,276
Excuse me.

673
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:23,846
Stop it.

674
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:25,356
Aigoo, hey.

675
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,856
Why are you bothering Joon Woo?

676
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:29,176
Leave him alone.

677
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:31,196
We wanted to say hi.

678
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:34,266
Aigoo, sorry.

679
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:35,686
You guys.

680
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,296
Joon Woo...

681
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,036
received dermatology treatment.

682
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:41,756
He doesn't want to see anyone.

683
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:43,496
I spoke to him on
 the phone earlier.

684
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:46,406
- Oh, I see.
- What treatment?

685
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:48,396
Did you do an aesthetic treatment?

686
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,946
Your eyes? Or your nose?

687
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:52,256
- Where? How much did you pay?
- Hey, Hae Deun.

688
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,586
Aigoo, sorry, Joon Woo.

689
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:57,786
I brought you dinner over there.

690
00:37:57,786 --> 00:37:59,286
Eat it later.

691
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:00,856
Hey.

692
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,536
Let's leave. Let's go.

693
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:03,906
Gosh, the smell.

694
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,876
Hey.

695
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:06,746
Wash your feet.

696
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:08,276
- Let's go.
- Geez...

697
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:09,546
I'll wash them.

698
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:10,956
Wait.

699
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,486
Wait a minute.

700
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:17,796
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

701
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,096
I heard we're the same age.

702
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,606
I'll speak casually.

703
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:24,756
Enjoy your dinner.

704
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:39,516
Gosh, I thought I'd suffocate.

705
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:46,506
But how could Lee Ra Hoon and 
Lee Hae Deun lie like that?

706
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:51,696
Oh, yay!

707
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,196
Okay, thank you for 
all your hard work today.

708
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:11,226
Eat lots of meat.

709
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:12,886
Good job!

710
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:15,456
 Thank you! 

711
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:18,436
Where is Hwang Na Ro?

712
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:20,256
He's preparing the briefing
 files for the Spain project.

713
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:22,266
Bit Chae Woon is helping him.

714
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,966
They're suspicious.

715
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:26,006
What do you mean suspicious?

716
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:28,346
They can help each other 
out as colleagues.

717
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:30,916
Hi, Oppa. Where are you?

718
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:33,606
You're almost here. Come in.

719
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:35,186
Oppa!

720
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:37,856
Her boyfriend.

721
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:39,486
Director's boyfriend.

722
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,306
Wait...

723
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:46,776
Where is my mom?

724
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:49,156
She left saying she's busy.

725
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,716
Then you should've told me.

726
00:39:51,716 --> 00:39:53,746
Director, your boyfriend?

727
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:55,166
Me?

728
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,036
I'll introduce him properly.

729
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:58,676
This is Mr. Woo Jae Hee.

730
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:00,536
He runs an architectural firm.

731
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:03,056
He's been my older brother's 
friend since childhood.

732
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,336
And...

733
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,896
And my...

734
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,576
He's your boyfriend, right? 
We know everything.

735
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:10,886
- Oh, no...
- You look good together!

736
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:12,556
 You look great together. 

737
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:14,406
Woo Jae Hee.

738
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:18,976
 Oppa! 

739
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,536
 Oppa! 

740
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,716
 What are you doing? 

741
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:24,266
 Avoiding your girlfriend? 

742
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:27,696
Wow, I get to see you here.
 I'm happy to see you.

743
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:29,326
Do you know each other?

744
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,116
We live in the same house. 
In the same villa.

745
00:40:32,116 --> 00:40:33,336
Really?

746
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:34,936
Is that true?

747
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:36,496
Yeah.

748
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:42,486
I've been so busy lately that 
I couldn't visit you.

749
00:40:42,486 --> 00:40:43,656
I had no idea.

750
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:47,126
To welcome Director Jang Seo Ah's 
boyfriend enthusiastically,

751
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:48,816
a round of applause!

752
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:55,296
 Welcome! 

753
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:57,846
Everyone...

754
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:00,646
I have to say something.

755
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:03,326
Well, Director Jang Seo Ah 
and I are...

756
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:05,376
not in any special relationship.

757
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,456
We're not in a relationship. 
She's just my friend's younger sister.

758
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:09,196
My friend's sister.

759
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,146
We were close since childhood.

760
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:20,136
She's pulling my leg. 
Why are you kidding around?

761
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:23,166
Geez, I don't think so.

762
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,856
 Geez... 

763
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,856
I'm sorry. I was in
 the middle of a job.

764
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:29,146
Enjoy your dinner.

765
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:30,966
Where are you going?

766
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:32,666
I have to go.

767
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:35,236
Geez, you can't leave like this.

768
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:37,836
It's nice to run into our fellow 
Samgwang resident outside.

769
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:39,986
Eat before you go. 
This is an expensive place.

770
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:41,486
- This way.
- No...

771
00:41:41,486 --> 00:41:42,736
I have to get going.

772
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,646
Geez, you're so shy.

773
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:49,206
Everyone, I think our 
director's boyfriend is shy.

774
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,766
What do we do at times like this?

775
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:52,646
 Drink. 

776
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,526
 Drink. 

777
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:56,276
 Drink. 

778
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:58,586
 - Drink. 
- All right, all right. Sit down.

779
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,366
There's no food at 
home at this point.

780
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:02,056
Geez, seriously.

781
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:11,586
My apologies. I'm sorry.

782
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:19,556
He must be really busy 
with his work.

783
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:21,156
Okay, let's eat by ourselves.

784
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,806
 Let's eat. 

785
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:40,886
 

786
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:46,136
 - The customer is currently on another call.  
- Oppa!

787
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,156
  You'll be connected to the voicemail.  

788
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,566
How can you do this to me?

789
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:55,906
It's so embarrassing in
 front of my staff...

790
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,956
Why be embarrassed? 
I said it nicely.

791
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:01,716
And you. Why didn't you tell me 
that my mother left earlier?

792
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:05,616
Because I wanted to
 introduce you to my staff.

793
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,956
Seo Ah.

794
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:10,136
- We cleared this up...
- Even so, did you have to say that there?

795
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:13,056
Are you flirting with 
a woman in there?

796
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,796
Did you have to say that there?

797
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:17,836
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

798
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:20,416
But I should be clear 
about these things...

799
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:25,306
Seo Ah, I've got a lot 
going on these days.

800
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:27,436
I'm sorry. I'm off. 
See you next time.

801
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:34,836
You're so mean, Oppa.

802
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:38,256
Yes, Manager. Thank you.

803
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:46,556
♫  In the pitch-black road of mine  ♫

804
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:48,046
Geez.

805
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:51,396
Stop doing this to me.

806
00:43:54,056 --> 00:43:55,326
I'm leaving.

807
00:43:55,326 --> 00:43:57,686
♫  Like the star that's shining 
like a jewel in the night sky  ♫

808
00:43:57,686 --> 00:43:59,016
Oppa!

809
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:02,186
♫  The shining day will come  ♫

810
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:03,546
Her boyfriend?

811
00:44:06,526 --> 00:44:09,556
♫  A night without anyone 
to lean on or to talk to  ♫

812
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:11,766
Director Jang left early.

813
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:15,426
She says we can eat
 our hearts out tonight.

814
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:23,036
Don't you think Director had an 
argument with her boyfriend?

815
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,096
The mood turned 
kind of sour earlier.

816
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,286
An argument? They took 
off by themselves.

817
00:44:27,286 --> 00:44:30,056
Eat slowly. You'll get sick.

818
00:44:30,056 --> 00:44:32,866
I came here late. 
I have to catch up.

819
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:54,026
You're here again.

820
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:55,376
I'm here again.

821
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,136
Here. Change your flowers 
with these new ones.

822
00:44:57,136 --> 00:44:58,996
The flowers are so pretty.

823
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,966
What were you doing?

824
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:02,326
What's this?

825
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:04,826
Preparing to open up a store?

826
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:06,416
Yeah.

827
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:08,326
Hey.

828
00:45:08,396 --> 00:45:11,956
You come and visit my place
 whenever you want to.

829
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:14,476
When are you going to
 invite me to your place?

830
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:19,376
I'm sorry. I should've had you over.

831
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:20,956
It's okay.

832
00:45:20,956 --> 00:45:23,466
Things have been
 hectic for me lately.

833
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:27,076
You said you share 
a house, right?

834
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:30,566
Yeah, well, it's like a monthly 
rental boarding house.

835
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:32,926
There are places like
 that these days.

836
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:37,266
Mom.

837
00:45:39,346 --> 00:45:40,966
You know, Father...

838
00:45:41,986 --> 00:45:43,286
Jae Hee.

839
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:45,766
I ask of you. For now...

840
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:48,306
don't bring up your father.

841
00:45:48,306 --> 00:45:51,536
Until I get better from 
my depression,

842
00:45:51,536 --> 00:45:54,546
and until I'm completely 
independent. Okay?

843
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,056
All right.

844
00:45:57,306 --> 00:45:58,756
Thanks, my son.

845
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:07,906
Jae Hee really said that?

846
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:09,806
In front of your staff?

847
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:13,296
The staff seemed to
 take it as a joke.

848
00:46:14,626 --> 00:46:16,926
But how can he do that?

849
00:46:16,976 --> 00:46:20,116
So, why did you invite 
Jae Hee to the work dinner?

850
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:21,916
To introduce him...

851
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:24,386
as my boyfriend officially 
in front of everyone.

852
00:46:24,386 --> 00:46:26,836
You stretch your arm no further
 than your sleeve will reach.

853
00:46:26,836 --> 00:46:29,316
You knew Jae Hee wasn't 
playing along with you.

854
00:46:29,316 --> 00:46:31,376
But I didn't know he'd act like that.

855
00:46:34,496 --> 00:46:36,166
Gosh, seriously.

856
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:40,786
Is Jae Hee dating 
someone or something?

857
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:45,926
That Jae Hee...

858
00:46:45,926 --> 00:46:48,926
Where would he find a girl 
who's better than my daughter?

859
00:46:57,186 --> 00:47:00,536
 - And my...
- He's your boyfriend, right? 

860
00:47:00,536 --> 00:47:01,866
 I'm sorry. 

861
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:03,786
 You know I'm always busy. 

862
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:07,416
 That's not it. 

863
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:09,826
Ah...

864
00:47:10,596 --> 00:47:13,176
That's why he didn't say anything.

865
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:15,996
He knew I didn't get 
along with Seo Ah,

866
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:18,316
but he did nothing since 
she's his girlfriend.

867
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:24,946
Geez!

868
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,056
Why do I feel so terrible?

869
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:31,106
Whether Jang Seo Ah is 
dating Koala or a sloth,

870
00:47:31,106 --> 00:47:32,826
what do I care?

871
00:47:35,426 --> 00:47:37,126
I ate too much.

872
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:42,776
You have a stomachache, right?

873
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,636
Geez, take this digestive medicine.

874
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:48,156
Did you follow me?

875
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:52,306
I'm going home, too.

876
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:57,206
You didn't hear me at all, no matter 
how loud I called out to you.

877
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,966
You can't see nor hear anything 
when you get angry, right?

878
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:01,266
I'm not angry.

879
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:03,096
Why would I get angry after 
eating expensive meat?

880
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:04,556
That's what I mean.

881
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:07,406
Why do you get an upset stomach 
after eating expensive meat?

882
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:10,516
Well, I guess I got sick because 
of the expensive meat.

883
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,846
I'm right.

884
00:48:24,846 --> 00:48:26,786
You are angry.

885
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:29,916
I'm not angry!

886
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:36,826
Geez.

887
00:48:38,486 --> 00:48:40,956
You've got quite a temper, 
Bit Chae Woon.

888
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:51,086
 Jae Hee. 

889
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:53,586
 I ask of you. For now... 

890
00:48:53,586 --> 00:48:56,166
 don't bring up your father. 

891
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:00,776
Right.

892
00:49:00,776 --> 00:49:03,956
For now, let's hide the fact.

893
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:12,526
Ahjussi, coming home now?

894
00:49:12,546 --> 00:49:16,126
Hyung, I heard James
 startled you earlier.

895
00:49:16,126 --> 00:49:18,146
Huh? Yeah...

896
00:49:18,146 --> 00:49:22,196
Whoa, we were totally in shock 
when we saw James at first.

897
00:49:24,186 --> 00:49:27,556
I guess he really 
shocked Mr. Woo.

898
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:30,326
- I'm home.
- Oh, my.

899
00:49:30,346 --> 00:49:31,716
Mr. Woo, you're home.

900
00:49:31,716 --> 00:49:34,386
You were startled 
this afternoon, huh?

901
00:49:34,386 --> 00:49:36,856
Well, no. That...

902
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:40,296
Where is that ahjussi?

903
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:42,466
James?

904
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:44,656
He's sleeping in Hwak Se's
 room right now.

905
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:46,436
Hwak Se went to work.

906
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:52,076
So, where did you run
 into him at first?

907
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:54,526
Well...

908
00:49:55,476 --> 00:49:56,976
That day...

909
00:49:56,976 --> 00:50:00,576
I went somewhere.

910
00:50:00,576 --> 00:50:04,736
He was riding his bike and...

911
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:23,386
Did he really get hurt?

912
00:50:51,356 --> 00:50:52,916
Yes, Noonim.

913
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,546
I'm glad to hear that 
Jae Hee is okay.

914
00:50:55,546 --> 00:50:58,216
Yes, yes. Get some 
rest, Noonim.

915
00:51:03,676 --> 00:51:05,316
 Father! 

916
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:08,016
 - Wait, a creditor...
- Why are you running away, Father? 

917
00:51:09,256 --> 00:51:11,506
Did I mishear him say "father"?

918
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:12,966
Welcome.

919
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:15,086
Welcome.

920
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:46,266
What's up, Aunt?

921
00:51:46,266 --> 00:51:47,616
What? Do you want some jokbal?

922
00:51:47,616 --> 00:51:48,886
I'm out for a stroll.

923
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:50,406
Why eat jokbal this late at night?

924
00:51:50,406 --> 00:51:51,946
Carry on.

925
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:59,126
Boss, please take their order.

926
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,236
Okay.

927
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:08,376
Is that your best?

928
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,466
It's heavier than yours.

929
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:11,896
What did you say?

930
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:13,886
Hi, Chae Woon noona
 and Na Ro hyung.

931
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:17,296
Unni, daebak. Did you know one 
more resident was living here?

932
00:52:17,296 --> 00:52:18,546
What?

933
00:52:18,546 --> 00:52:20,406
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

934
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:21,646
What are you saying?

935
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:30,786
You know...

936
00:52:30,786 --> 00:52:32,746
let's talk.

937
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:35,326
Talk about what?

938
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:37,236
Well...

939
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:04,176
So what?

940
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:25,906
Stop.

941
00:53:25,906 --> 00:53:28,286
Gosh, scared me.

942
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:30,586
Geez.

943
00:53:31,766 --> 00:53:33,316
She's not my girlfriend.

944
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:34,506
What?

945
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:38,146
I'm not Seo Ah's boyfriend.

946
00:53:38,146 --> 00:53:41,136
I clearly said so at 
the restaurant earlier.

947
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:44,726
When? I didn't hear that.

948
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:47,936
I know. Of all timing, you went out 
to talk on the phone just then.

949
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:50,386
Anyway, Seo Ah and I are nothing.

950
00:53:50,386 --> 00:53:53,346
My best friend Joon Ah.

951
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:55,606
Seo Ah is his younger sister.

952
00:53:55,606 --> 00:53:57,776
I didn't ask, and I don't 
want to know.

953
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,166
Wait.

954
00:54:01,546 --> 00:54:04,306
And the reason why

955
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:08,336
I stayed quiet during your
 middle school incident

956
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:11,206
is because it was awkward
 for me to step in.

957
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,786
I'm sure you did.

958
00:54:12,786 --> 00:54:15,666
You need my help with your work,

959
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,276
and since we live Samgwang Villa,

960
00:54:17,276 --> 00:54:19,616
- you didn't want to self-destruct.
- Self-destruct?

961
00:54:19,616 --> 00:54:21,336
Did I commit a crime?

962
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:22,936
Did I say you did?

963
00:54:22,936 --> 00:54:24,216
Why are you getting angry?

964
00:54:24,216 --> 00:54:26,296
You're the one getting angry, 
Woo Jae Hee!

965
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,036
You are angry. You're not 
calling me Koala, either.

966
00:54:29,036 --> 00:54:30,526
My gosh.

967
00:54:32,326 --> 00:54:33,716
Geez.

968
00:54:34,526 --> 00:54:36,216
Geez, hey.

969
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:39,356
So, I'm really not.

970
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:40,476
I don't have a girlfriend. Really.

971
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:43,176
- All right?
- Who cares if you do or not?

972
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:44,726
Well, that is true.

973
00:54:44,726 --> 00:54:48,746
Did you look at the revised floor
 plan email Mr. Yoo sent you?

974
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:50,136
Right?

975
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:51,876
You do need something from me.

976
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:52,826
What?

977
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:56,056
You want to ask me for a favor, 
so you want to resolve and move on.

978
00:54:56,056 --> 00:54:57,236
Geez.

979
00:54:58,986 --> 00:55:00,926
Do I look that calculative?

980
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,146
Yes!

981
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:05,336
Woo Jae Hee.

982
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,356
I'll make this crystal clear.

983
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:10,276
I don't care whether you have

984
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:12,046
a girlfriend or a wife.

985
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:13,316
Nah.

986
00:55:13,316 --> 00:55:14,966
I think you do care.

987
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:17,916
I don't care!

988
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:21,646
Why are you yelling?

989
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:25,426
Bit Chae Woon.

990
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:27,506
Bit Chae Woon.

991
00:55:27,506 --> 00:55:29,896
 - Open the door! 
- They're getting dangerous.

992
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,646
 How do I go in? 

993
00:55:31,646 --> 00:55:34,876
What if they really get 
close at that rate?

994
00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:37,726
Geez.

995
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,846
It's about time my charm 
starts to work on her.

996
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,886
Geez!

997
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:53,606
What's wrong with me?

998
00:55:55,296 --> 00:55:56,736
Gosh.

999
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,706
 Oh, my gosh! 

1000
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:11,166
 No wonder I liked 
Bit Chae Woon so much. 

1001
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,386
 - This is so neat. Right?
- Yes. 

1002
00:56:14,386 --> 00:56:16,686
 Soon Jung, you weren't... 

1003
00:56:16,686 --> 00:56:18,896
 married then, though. 

1004
00:56:21,356 --> 00:56:23,796
 It will be over if 
you carry the burden. 

1005
00:56:23,796 --> 00:56:26,136
 Why are you trying to 
dig up everything now? 

1006
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:49,426
 

1007
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:56,686
Ma'am, did you sleep well?

1008
00:56:56,686 --> 00:56:58,486
Yes, James.

1009
00:56:58,486 --> 00:57:00,076
Did you sleep well?

1010
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:02,006
- Yes.
- You woke up early.

1011
00:57:02,006 --> 00:57:05,986
I'd like to help you with 
preparing breakfast.

1012
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:08,196
Gosh, no. Just relax.

1013
00:57:08,196 --> 00:57:09,516
Oh, no.

1014
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:11,956
Since everyone knows about me,

1015
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:14,356
I'd like to help out in any way I can.

1016
00:57:14,356 --> 00:57:17,016
Oh, should I peel these?

1017
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:19,726
- Yes, sure.
- Okay.

1018
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:22,986
- Mom, good morning!
- Hi.

1019
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,686
Is he the one?

1020
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:30,146
Hello, I heard about you.

1021
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,466
I couldn't say hello because
 I came home late last night.

1022
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:34,576
I'm the oldest daughter, 
Bit Chae Woon.

1023
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,396
Oh, I see.

1024
00:57:36,396 --> 00:57:38,436
Nice to meet you.

1025
00:57:38,436 --> 00:57:39,956
I'm James.

1026
00:57:40,826 --> 00:57:42,726
Was it tough to hide out?

1027
00:57:42,736 --> 00:57:44,046
No.

1028
00:57:44,046 --> 00:57:47,056
Hwak Se and Soon Jung 
were so good to me.

1029
00:57:47,056 --> 00:57:48,926
I had no trouble at all.

1030
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:51,296
But...

1031
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:55,786
all three of your daughters
 look so kind.

1032
00:57:56,546 --> 00:57:58,766
- Three?
- Yes.

1033
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:01,546
There are only two daughters.

1034
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:03,046
Hae Deun and me.

1035
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,326
What?

1036
00:58:04,326 --> 00:58:05,856
Oh...

1037
00:58:05,856 --> 00:58:09,236
I saw someone upstairs yesterday.

1038
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,576
She had long hair like this.

1039
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:16,016
Hae Deun doesn't have long hair.

1040
00:58:16,016 --> 00:58:17,196
What?

1041
00:58:22,446 --> 00:58:25,846
He must've seen Hae Deun.

1042
00:58:25,846 --> 00:58:28,866
Sometimes she looks 
like she has long hair.

1043
00:58:28,866 --> 00:58:29,996
Yeah.

1044
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:32,206
- My gosh.
- That's right.

1045
00:58:33,126 --> 00:58:35,076
Is that so?

1046
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:36,866
Good morning.

1047
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:39,196
Hi, Mr. Woo, did you sleep well?

1048
00:58:43,126 --> 00:58:44,696
Did you sleep well?

1049
00:58:47,246 --> 00:58:50,206
Are you peeling potatoes?

1050
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:55,686
Mr. Woo, James is so attentive.

1051
00:58:55,686 --> 00:58:57,836
He's a big help with house chores.

1052
00:58:59,056 --> 00:59:01,216
He's a big help with house chores?

1053
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:02,726
Yeah.

1054
00:59:02,726 --> 00:59:06,966
He must've been so 
kind to his wife.

1055
00:59:08,426 --> 00:59:10,346
Isn't that right, James?

1056
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:13,126
I think I must've been.

1057
00:59:15,226 --> 00:59:18,526
My gosh, I wish you'd get
 your memory back soon.

1058
00:59:18,536 --> 00:59:21,116
I'll come back later...

1059
00:59:21,116 --> 00:59:23,856
and take James to the hospital.

1060
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:26,506
My gosh. Thank you, Mr. Woo.

1061
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:29,526
Thank you.

1062
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:31,026
Sure.

1063
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:34,226
Mother, good morning.

1064
00:59:34,226 --> 00:59:35,876
Good morning, Na Ro.

1065
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:36,726
Hi.

1066
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:41,976
Hello.

1067
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:42,876
Hi.

1068
00:59:48,386 --> 00:59:50,496
I'm off to work!

1069
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:53,546
Hey, Bit Chae Woon.

1070
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:55,866
Aren't you late? I'll give you a ride.

1071
00:59:55,866 --> 00:59:58,376
It's okay. We're not headed 
in the same direction.

1072
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:01,046
I'm on my way to 
a construction site.

1073
01:00:01,046 --> 01:00:02,176
I'll drive you.

1074
01:00:02,176 --> 01:00:04,126
Bit Chae Woon, we'll be late.

1075
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:06,016
Do you want to grab
 a taxi down there?

1076
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:08,886
- Sounds good.
- Let's go.

1077
01:00:09,826 --> 01:00:12,266
Koala, good day.

1078
01:00:15,626 --> 01:00:19,026
Does James really have amnesia?

1079
01:00:21,336 --> 01:00:22,726
Cunning Penguin.

1080
01:00:22,726 --> 01:00:24,196
Headbutt.

1081
01:00:24,196 --> 01:00:26,276
Geez...

1082
01:00:26,276 --> 01:00:28,316
That's bad.

1083
01:00:40,926 --> 01:00:43,166
 You look great together! 

1084
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:44,726
 - That's not it...
- You look great together! 

1085
01:00:54,876 --> 01:00:57,416
Did Ms. Lee see the 
email I sent her?

1086
01:00:57,426 --> 01:00:58,726
The revised floor plan?

1087
01:00:59,526 --> 01:01:00,626
I'm sure she did.

1088
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:02,296
Why didn't she give me 
her feedback then?

1089
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:04,056
Try calling her.

1090
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:06,826
You call her.

1091
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:10,296
Did you guys fight?

1092
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:14,076
Aigoo, geez, seriously.

1093
01:01:14,076 --> 01:01:15,726
Nice going.

1094
01:01:16,726 --> 01:01:18,286
It's not like you're 
school-aged kids.

1095
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,686
Yes, Mr. Lee, it's me.

1096
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:24,656
When do you get off work today?

1097
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:27,126
You'll have to come by 
and take a look at this.

1098
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:29,096
I'm not sure.

1099
01:01:29,096 --> 01:01:31,266
Mr. Woo will stay here.

1100
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:34,316
She won't come 
because I'm here?

1101
01:01:37,466 --> 01:01:38,906
Ms. Lee.

1102
01:01:38,906 --> 01:01:41,296
If you joined our project, 
you should see it to the end.

1103
01:01:41,296 --> 01:01:44,496
Just because you're miffed at me, 
are you tossing the work aside?

1104
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:46,676
Excuse me?

1105
01:01:46,676 --> 01:01:50,556
Isn't that what you mean? You don't 
want to come since I'm here.

1106
01:01:50,556 --> 01:01:52,586
No, that's not it.

1107
01:01:52,586 --> 01:01:54,746
How about at home? 
You won't come home, either?

1108
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:56,176
Just because you don't
 want to see me?

1109
01:01:56,176 --> 01:01:58,566
Are you guys living together?

1110
01:01:58,566 --> 01:02:01,296
Hey, how about Seo Ah?

1111
01:02:01,296 --> 01:02:03,996
That's not it. I haven't had the 
chance to tell you. Hold on.

1112
01:02:03,996 --> 01:02:06,176
Headbutt, no, Bit Chae Woon...

1113
01:02:06,176 --> 01:02:07,286
Hello?

1114
01:02:10,586 --> 01:02:13,116
 - The customer can't answer the call right now. 
- Geez!

1115
01:02:13,116 --> 01:02:16,126
That Headbutt. She's taking 
revenge on me like this.

1116
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:21,476
Let's talk later. Get back to work.

1117
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:22,946
Geez.

1118
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:25,756
Wow, really.

1119
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:28,656
I made time to stop by 
while I was working offsite.

1120
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:31,056
I should just leave.

1121
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:41,826
It's all my fault.

1122
01:02:41,826 --> 01:02:44,876
I should've drawn a clear line.

1123
01:02:45,926 --> 01:02:47,666
Geez, seriously.

1124
01:02:51,036 --> 01:02:52,766
Jae Hee!

1125
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:56,956
An accident?

1126
01:02:56,956 --> 01:02:58,756
 How did this happen? 

1127
01:02:58,756 --> 01:03:00,286
Hey, Mr. Woo, are you okay?

1128
01:03:00,286 --> 01:03:01,866
Wake up!

1129
01:03:01,866 --> 01:03:03,366
Are you okay?

1130
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:05,946
Koala! Koala!

1131
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:08,046
What happened? What happened?

1132
01:03:08,046 --> 01:03:09,556
He fell from there.

1133
01:03:09,556 --> 01:03:11,086
Oh, my gosh!

1134
01:03:11,086 --> 01:03:14,446
- Where are you hurting? Where?
- Wait...

1135
01:03:14,446 --> 01:03:17,386
I think I hurt my back. It's okay.

1136
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:19,406
What do you mean you're
 okay? Let me see.

1137
01:03:19,406 --> 01:03:21,066
Let me see. Over here?

1138
01:03:24,276 --> 01:03:27,706
How about here? 
Let me see. Over here?

1139
01:03:27,706 --> 01:03:28,996
Here, too?

1140
01:03:28,996 --> 01:03:30,906
I'm ticklish!

1141
01:03:36,336 --> 01:03:37,856
Hey, you.

1142
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:39,306
You did this last time, too!

1143
01:03:39,306 --> 01:03:40,936
Darn you!

1144
01:03:40,936 --> 01:03:42,836
It really hurts! It hurts!

1145
01:03:42,836 --> 01:03:44,636
Geez.

1146
01:03:44,636 --> 01:03:46,566
Gosh.

1147
01:03:51,716 --> 01:03:53,716
Bit Chae Woon, did I scare you?

1148
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:55,736
I mean...

1149
01:03:56,736 --> 01:04:00,116
I was up there and just...

1150
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:02,216
I was just... did I scare you?

1151
01:04:03,276 --> 01:04:05,436
Bit Chae Woon. Bit Chae Woon!

1152
01:04:05,436 --> 01:04:07,236
Geez, Bit Chae Woon!

1153
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:10,366
Bit Chae Woon!

1154
01:04:10,366 --> 01:04:11,986
Bit Chae Woon!

1155
01:04:11,986 --> 01:04:13,566
Bit Chae Woon!

1156
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:14,796
I'm sorry.

1157
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:17,366
I'm sorry. I scared you a lot.

1158
01:04:17,366 --> 01:04:18,886
You shouldn't kid around like that.

1159
01:04:18,886 --> 01:04:19,946
Wait.

1160
01:04:19,946 --> 01:04:22,866
I'm sorry. I had no idea 
you'd be so worried.

1161
01:04:22,866 --> 01:04:25,186
What do you mean worry?
 I just got scared.

1162
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:27,576
You got scared because 
you were worried about me.

1163
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:30,426
I just got scared. What worry?

1164
01:04:30,426 --> 01:04:32,396
You did worry.

1165
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:35,696
That's why you got teary-eyed.

1166
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:40,046
- When I get scared...
- Don't say you cry when you get scared.

1167
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,196
Wait.

1168
01:04:55,606 --> 01:04:57,126
I'm sorry.

1169
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,426
I'm sorry for scaring you...

1170
01:04:59,426 --> 01:05:01,476
and I'm sorry for joking around.

1171
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,426
And...

1172
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:09,576
I'm sorry I didn't draw 
a clear line with Seo Ah.

1173
01:05:12,296 --> 01:05:15,326
What do I care whether 
you draw the line or not?

1174
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:17,626
You do care.

1175
01:05:18,556 --> 01:05:20,246
I care.

1176
01:05:24,056 --> 01:05:25,346
About what?

1177
01:05:27,096 --> 01:05:28,756
Why do you care?

1178
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:31,296
Because it bothers me.

1179
01:05:33,826 --> 01:05:36,726
Because when I see 
you upset like this,

1180
01:05:37,526 --> 01:05:39,626
it bothers me.

1181
01:05:42,766 --> 01:05:44,166
Because...

1182
01:05:46,796 --> 01:05:48,006
I...

1183
01:05:49,606 --> 01:05:51,066
think...

1184
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:54,406
I think...

1185
01:05:56,006 --> 01:05:57,816
I like you.

1186
01:06:02,576 --> 01:06:05,266
Don't you feel the same way, 
Bit Chae Woon?

1187
01:06:13,526 --> 01:06:15,266
Isn't that right?

1188
01:06:38,596 --> 01:06:44,956
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1189
01:06:44,956 --> 01:06:53,036
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1190
01:06:53,036 --> 01:06:57,926
♫  We're drawn to each
 other like the magnets  ♫

1191
01:06:57,926 --> 01:06:59,706
 

1192
01:06:59,706 --> 01:07:01,296
 It's Woo Jung Hoo. 

1193
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:03,026
 - You're his son, right?
- You're lying, right? 

1194
01:07:03,026 --> 01:07:04,746
 Be honest with me. 

1195
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:06,176
 You don't have amnesia, right? 

1196
01:07:06,176 --> 01:07:08,576
 - To our neighborhood?
- What should I do, Mom? 

1197
01:07:08,576 --> 01:07:10,916
 Chae Woon, bring her over. 

1198
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:18,046
 I'll be more aggressive in 
helping you out from now on. 

1199
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:19,316
 Hang out with Jae Hee. 

1200
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:22,516
 - I won't give up on you, Oppa.
- Seo Ah, I like someone else. 

1201
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:23,576
 Who? 

1202
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:25,406
 
 Pil Hong hyungnim is 
getting out? Already? 

1203
01:07:25,406 --> 01:07:27,006
 Wait for me, world. 

1204
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:28,916
 Park Pil Hong is coming. 

1205
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:32,536
♫  The rain called you
 is making me wet  ♫
