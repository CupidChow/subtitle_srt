1
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200
Are you okay, Noonim? 
      

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,120
Don't you have to go to a hospital?

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,500
My friend is a doctor. Should I call him? He lives in the next building.

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm okay now.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,490
I get surprised easily and have an indigestion problem.

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,100
Mainly because of somebody.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,100
I'm sorry. I should've not brought the dumplings.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,100
- Did you bring these dumplings? 
 - Yes.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Of course, she gets choked on it because she doesn't like dumplings!

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,980
What are you talking about it? I love dumplings.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Oh, did you?

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,260
  Look at him. He doesn't even know what his wife likes.  

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,920
But still, I'll ask my friend just in case.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,300
Hello? It's me. Can you talk right now?

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, I was wondering, what should I do if somebody gets food stuck in their throat?

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,400
- They don't have any other symptoms, but-- 
 - Yes, aunt! It's me!

17
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,630
Can I talk to you right now?

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,010
Yes, James! What's going on?

19
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,570
Yes! There's somebody who had food stuck in their throat. Should we go to an emergency room, doctor?

20
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,750
Oh, that happened to whom?

21
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,890
Ah, to my old friend.

22
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,940
Oh. Are they okay now?

23
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,660
Oh, yes. That' a relief.

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,400
Then, just let them drink some warm water and relax.

25
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,300
Jjung-a!

26
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,310
If any other symptoms come up, call me.

27
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,540
- Yes! 
 - Who is it?

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
- Ah, it's Mr. Eems. 
 - Yeah?

29
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,500
He said his friend had something stuck in their throat.

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,400
- His old friend? 
 - Yes.

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,340
- Who would that be? 
 - I don't know.

32
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,870
Noonim, my friend said, since you're breathing fine, so it's okay--

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,600
Drink some warm water and relax. That's what Man Jung said.

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,500
Why did you even call Man Jung?

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
- Who would that be? 
 - Oh!

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll go to the door.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,900
Hello, grandfa--

38
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,790
Wow.

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,310
Hello, ajussi.

40
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,780
Hello, kid.

41
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,550
You finally recognize me properly.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,940
Also, could you call me an uncle, not an ajussi?

43
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,860
Call me, uncle Eems.

44
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,490
- Yes... 
   - Ba Wi, come inside!  

45
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,750
I guess he came here to find his dad!

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,000
- Did you come here because your dad wasn't coming back? 
 - Did you come here to find me, Ba Wi?

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,400
My friend said to call him if you have any unusual symptoms in 30 minutes. He said he'll run right here.

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,300
Thank you so much. You're very kind!

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,940
My dad is always kind!

50
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,670
He said he was very popular with girls!

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,010
  That's right, dad?  

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,350
- This boy! 
 - Is that so? I think so, too!

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,960
- Yes? 
 - Grandfather... no, ajussi... no, uncle Eems!

54
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,380
- Yes! 
 - That's a toupee, right?

55
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,700
  Ba Wi...  

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,600
  I dyed my hair because of you, you little boy!  

57
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,800
  Woo Jung Hoo looks pretty good after dying his hair!  

58
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,150
By the way, why did you come here today?

59
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,880
Ah, I heard that you met up with Soon Jung.

60
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,610
Did she run to you already and told about it?

61
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
She didn't run to me.

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,400
But Jae Hee said to me as well that it's utterly ridiculous.

63
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,540
It's too salty!

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,700
Is it? It was good!

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,900
Man Jung said you shouldn't eat yet.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,600
By the way, what the hell was that?

67
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,920
I heard that you go against the children's marriage because I and Soon Jung needs to be together?

68
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,900
No, I didn't go against their marriage!

69
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,850
I said we should postpone the wedding until Chae Woon becomes the legal daughter of Jung Won!

70
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,800
Even though Chae Woon becomes the legal daughter of Jung Won, she's still Soon Jung's daughter as well.

71
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,840
How can you think of such ridiculous thoughts with a person who's going to be our in-law?

72
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,520
I was thinking of your future.

73
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,790
There's still a long time to live from now on!

74
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,650
Are you going to get older by yourself lonely?

75
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,600
Then, what about you? Aren't you going to be in the same situation as me--

76
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,650
- Ah! 
 - Ah?

77
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,330
That's why you did that. You felt bad to start a new life first, so you wanted to get me someone before.

78
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,940
How can you think about it that way!

79
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,100
You don't know my sincerity.

80
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,950
What kind of sincerity is that? It's just a delusion.

81
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,680
A delusion?

82
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,140
The first love that you dreamed of came in front of you! As a single!

83
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,800
If you married your first love, then you would've not become the stubborn, stingy person you're now.

84
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:57,360
You didn't want to, but I made you marry me, so this tragedy happened!

85
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,280
Did I say something wrong?

86
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,960
Sure.

87
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,180
I guess it can be like that.

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,130
Because of my bad temper, I made you who never had to suffer, suffer.

89
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,010
I pestered you so much, so you got the indigestion issue.

90
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,590
At least you admit that.

91
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:36,000
So, it was because I thought about your future, and your new start, purely on a friendship level.

92
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,900
I get it.

93
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,580
Thank you.

94
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay. I'll start my new life first.

95
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,260
And you should start a new life with that good-looking, tall guy across the hall.

96
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,840
Why are you keep trying to make me involved with professor Son?

97
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,060
What about you? You had been trying to involve me with Soon Jung the whole time!

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Anyway.

99
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,150
Either we are starting a new life separately or whatever, let's focus on Jae Hee getting married first.

100
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,400
Then, I'll get going.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,300
Ah.

102
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,700
How is your indigestion?

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm fine now.

104
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,180
That's good to hear.

105
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Wait.

106
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,000
You know that I have a therapy session tomorrow, right?

107
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,600
The doctor said I should come with you. Can you make it?

108
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,630
I don't know.

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:43,200
I don't know the two who will start new lives separately needs to go to a therapy session together.

110
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,720
That's true. Well, you can leave.

111
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,270
Why is he acting like that when I said I'm going to help him start his new life?

112
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,060
My goodness!

113
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,230
When did he eat all of the dumplings?

114
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,230
He doesn't even like dumplings!

115
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:22,860
  Is it like when I ate all of the egg buns that Soon Jung made?  

116
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,170
Since you're helping me, the work is getting done faster!

117
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,430
There are so many things to do!

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,700
I hope this goes well, so you can pay off all of your debt.

119
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,460
You said you still have a lot of debt even after you sold your studio, right?

120
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,650
Yes. I'm still paying off my best!

121
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:58,500
I heard from Chief Yoo that your debt is because you were losing money for your contractors.

122
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,600
I can't turn away from people going through trouble.

123
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,990
But because I sold that place, I moved into the Samgwang villa, so I met you!

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,100
That's true.

125
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I wish I can make enough money to get our own place.

126
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Yes. A small and pretty house.

127
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,700
That day has to come as soon as possible! But why did my mom said we should wait for what?

128
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,490
I think she has a plan in her mind for your father.

129
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,800
I was thinking about this in the office today.

130
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,000
I thought about what it would be like in your mother's position. And then, that just popped in my head.

131
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,090
I guess my mom is a unique person.

132
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,230
- Do you want some coffee? 
 - Sounds good.

133
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,390
I'll make some in decaf.

134
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,990
  Ah, you should enjoy the scent first. Like this.  

135
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,300
Did you hear anything from Park Pil Hong yet?

136
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,910
Ah...

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
In fact, I ran into him earlier today.

138
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,300
He came by to pick his stuff up.

139
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,490
You should've called me!

140
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,430
I got his phone number.

141
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Also, I got his promise to keep in touch.

142
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,860
Give me his number. I'm going to meet up with him.

143
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,750
Moong-i.

144
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,480
Why don't you give him some time?

145
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,500
He said he wants to be a good father for you.

146
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,600
Do you trust his words?

147
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,400
I don't trust that! I'm never going to trust him!

148
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,290
If he were a trust-worthy person, then he would've not deceived us in the first place!

149
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,210
But I still want to trust him.

150
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,360
Let's not push him too hard and see what he does.

151
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,700
But what if he makes another trouble?

152
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,090
Why don't we give him a shot? He's your father.

153
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,700
Let's do it that way, shall we?

154
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,880
    
 Your phone is ringing a lot.  

155
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
This time it's aunt Man Jung?

156
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,490
I guess everyone's gathered right now.

157
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,780
And I think aunt Man Jung had no choice but to call me.

158
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,400
I guess you didn't have a good relationship with Bit Chae Woon's aunt?

159
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,860
I was in a good relationship with everybody.

160
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,500
Ah, besides with Woo Jae Hee.

161
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,600
What about with Bit Chae Woon? Did you have a good relationship with her?

162
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,900
It wasn't good nor bad.

163
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,500
Is it decided to fail the full-time position transition of Bit Chae Woon?

164
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,090
Yes.

165
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,740
I think she'll leave the company soon.

166
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,600
With her personality, it'll be strange if she doesn't leave.

167
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,400
I bet she must get so annoyed.

168
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,970
She doesn't get recognized in the company, and she doesn't get accepted as a daughter to my mom.

169
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,980
That's good. It's going according to the plan.

170
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,100
Are you really happy about it?

171
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
What?

172
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,900
I don't think you're truly pleased about it.

173
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,580
Then?

174
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,210
You look empty.

175
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:35,600
I think Seo Ah, you're actually not a person who hates and attack other people.

176
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,160
Did you just call me by my name?

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,600
Now you're crossing the line.

178
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,400
If you get warm affection all the time,

179
00:12:52,700 --> 00:13:00,500
you'll be a brighter, warmer, and sweet person than anybody else.

180
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,500
To make you into that kind of person,

181
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,290
I'll love you a lot, Seo Ah.

182
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,230
  Jae Hee's mom! Jae Hee's mom!  

183
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,320
Is she going to be okay now?

184
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,080
     

185
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,170
Ah, really...

186
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,090
We're strangers now. I should be nice.

187
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,880
Yes?

188
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,030
Her voice sounds fine.

189
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,080
What was that?

190
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,080
     

191
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,080
She's really fine now.

192
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,500
     

193
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,760
Ah, really!

194
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,930
Young lady Min Jae.

195
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,710
She still loves the president.

196
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,190
How can I make her realize the president's feeling?

197
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,100
Ah! That's right.

198
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
    
    

199
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,000
     

200
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,640
I guess Chae Woon came home!

201
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,950
  Oh, Chae Woon!  

202
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,300
You came home late tonight!

203
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,730
- I was helping Jae Hee's work a bit. 
 - Oh. It's cold outside, right?

204
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,010
Where's Mr. Woo?

205
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,120
He's going to stay overnight at the office. He has a very important contract tomorrow.

206
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,850
Oh. He's working really hard.

207
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,500
Earlier today, Mr. Woo's mother came by here.

208
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,140
Ah, really?

209
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,040
She's against our marriage, right?

210
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,800
No, she's not against it,

211
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,920
but she has a different reason that she needs to think about it.

212
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,750
Then, it was true that...

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,400
What? What are you talking about it?

214
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,660
I heard about you and James from Jae Hee today.

215
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,100
My goodness! Chae Woon!

216
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,310
It's nothing like that!

217
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,100
Are you sure?

218
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,350
It's nothing like that! There's nothing.

219
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,360
But you don't sound like it.

220
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,360
Chae Woon! My goodness.

221
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,600
I'm going to see the CEO soon, and talk about your wedding.

222
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,380
- That sounds good, right? 
 - Yes, sure.

223
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,900
- You should wash and come out! I'll prepare for your dinner. 
 - Okay...

224
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
- Hey, I recommend the pink one! 
 - Okay.

225
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,000
It can be not enough, so we should ask about this...

226
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,990
- The red one is pretty, too! 
 - My god!

227
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,900
What are you guys doing? What is this unusual scene right now?

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,900
Unni, are you coming home now?

229
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,990
- Unni, you're home! 
 - Hey, noona!

230
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,050
Lee Hae Deun, did you do it well earlier today?

231
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,570
Yes. I'm going to work for the online business team from tomorrow!

232
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:22,720
I was so surprised to hear that younger noona got head-hunted to the big noona's workplace!

233
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,400
I was so surprised as well!

234
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,050
It's not getting head-hunted, but it's just a contract position.

235
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,200
It can work out after doing the work! Congratulations my sister!

236
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm happy for you, unni!

237
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,200
- Thank you. 
 - Congrats!

238
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,700
But what are you guys looking at?

239
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,740
Ah, Lee Ra Hoon is thinking of taking over a second-hand food truck.

240
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,200
Even it's second-hand, it's going to be expensive!

241
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,500
We're getting it from a person we met through our boss, and it came out 40% cheaper than usual.

242
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,340
40% cheaper?

243
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,360
It's that one.

244
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,200
It's a street food franchise.

245
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Just with this, it looks okay.

246
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,350
Right? I think so, too!

247
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,500
Tomorrow we're going to meet up with the person who takes care of the franchise.

248
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,840
- Just two of you? 
 - Yes.

249
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,410
So, I talked about this with Ba Reun,

250
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,700
and if it's okay with you, it would be great if you can come with us tomorrow.

251
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,100
We're a bit worried to just decide by ourselves.

252
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,700
- But she's busy. 
 - Right. I mean, if it's possible.

253
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,920
Even though I'm busy, I should come with you guys because this is so important!

254
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,840
- What? Really? 
 - Unni!

255
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,100
- Noona, thank you so much! 
 - Thank you!

256
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,000
- Did you tell about this to mom? 
 - I'm going to tell her in the morning.

257
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,800
- Oh, Lee Ra Hoon, now you're a business owner! 
 - Call me an owner.

258
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm proud of you!

259
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
But it has to work out well.

260
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,200
With unni's help, it'll go great!

261
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,900
That's right! And we should work hard as well.

262
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,900
  - Fighting!   
 - Business owner! You should get us something!

263
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,200
  - Of course! Tell me everything that you want. 
 - I want a nice bag.  

264
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,480
  Then, what can I do because I'm your daughter?  

265
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,460
  What is possible because I'm your daughter?  

266
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,180
  Was being your daughter meant I have to give up so many things like now?  

267
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,150
- Young lady, you came home late tonight. 
 - Yes.

268
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,180
Thank you for your work.

269
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,760
- Seo Ah, you came home so late. 
 - Mom!

270
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,600
Mom, your daughter is home now.

271
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,700
Did you drink again?

272
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,670
I just drank a little bit in a good mood.

273
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,900
- Good night, mom. 
 - Did you...

274
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,700
drink with Hwang Na Ro?

275
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,220
Yes.

276
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,730
Seo Ah.

277
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,830
I really don't like that you go out for a drink with Hwang Na Ro like this.

278
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,000
What do you like about me, anyway?

279
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,070
Are you really going to have a relationship with Hwang Na Ro?

280
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,900
Please don't do that, Seo Ah!

281
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Why can't I date him?

282
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,160
Is it because his background is not good?

283
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,700
It's not about his background, but his human nature is the problem!

284
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,270
What's wrong with his human nature?

285
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,510
What do you know about him to say such a thing?

286
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,300
Isn't it enough if he likes me unconditionally and treats me well no matter what?

287
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,900
I can't be with Jae Hee oppa, and now I can't be with Hwang Na Ro!

288
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Why are you being like this to me, mom?

289
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,120
Because I think you're like this because you got angry with Jae Hee!

290
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,660
- You're being irrational! 
 - I'm not doing this in anger at the moment.

291
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,450
I'm in love with Hwang Na Ro.

292
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,200
What?

293
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,960
I think it's not like you don't like Hwang Na Ro,

294
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,220
but you don't trust what I do.

295
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,600
If Bit Chae Woon liked him,

296
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,100
you would've acted differently.

297
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,970
  Seo Ah!  

298
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,020
If you don't like me that much,

299
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,420
then you should bring your biological daughter and live with her.

300
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,220
I'll leave this house!

301
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,250
Or maybe you should leave the house.

302
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,300
How can you say such a thing?

303
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,720
Do you really don't know how many things I gave up because of you?

304
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,050
I announced that Chae Woon is not my daughter and let her leave this house. You saw all of those!

305
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,500
And how can you say such a thing to me!

306
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,540
That's what I'm saying!

307
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,010
So!

308
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,550
You should bring your real daughter and have a happy life together.

309
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,100
     

310
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,400
Ah, it's so strange.

311
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,020
What about it?

312
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,700
I mean, Na Ro didn't eat together with us that often,

313
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,000
but it feels empty after knowing that he actually left.

314
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,820
  Right, uncle?  

315
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,960
I wonder if he's eating well.

316
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,320
He'll be fine! Don't worry about him too much.

317
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,070
Then, is the downstair's room empty now?

318
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,550
- Yes. 
 - Oh?

319
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,200
If that room is empty, then Cha Ba Reun! You should take that room.

320
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
That's right!

321
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,600
Can I just keep using the room together with you?

322
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,000
- Why? 
 - Because I got attached to you!

323
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,740
What?

324
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,030
Don't get attached to me!

325
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,950
Ah! That's right! She shouldn't move to the downstair's room.

326
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,500
If she moves downstair's, then she would hang out with Ra Hoon over there in secret.

327
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,900
- No, we wouldn't do that! 
 - No!

328
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,400
A strong denial is suspicious!

329
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,700
  No! It's not like that...  

330
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,680
Wow! This meat! Noonim!

331
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,500
- Having a meat dish in the morning is so indulgent! 
 - Right. It's the best breakfast ever!

332
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,600
Have as much as you want!

333
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,070
- Mr. Woo, have a lot! 
 - Yes, mother!

334
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,370
Wait a second.

335
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,220
Son-in-law Woo.

336
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,240
Oh, with wasabi?

337
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,690
Wow! It goes well together!

338
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Right? It's a good combination, right?

339
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,950
  I learned this when I was working in a restaurant!  

340
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,800
- Uncle! 
 - Yes?

341
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,080
- Thank you! 
 - No, no!

342
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,300
- No, no. 
 - Okay, I get it. You should have it first.

343
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,610
Yes, thank you.

344
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,310
It's spicy!

345
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,900
I was going to give it to the uncle, but you took it! Why are you mad at me!

346
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,000
  Were you trying to pull a prank?  

347
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,510
Mr. Woo! I heard you have an important contract to make today.

348
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,260
Ah, yes.

349
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:05,020
It'll go well since you worked hard for it.

350
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,800
Thank you.

351
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,800
Today is an important day for everybody! Including Lee Ra Hoon.

352
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,440
Ra Hoon as well?

353
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:16,690
I'm going to take over a second-hand food truck today.

354
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,820
40% cheaper than usual.

355
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,400
Oh! That's great news, Ra Hoon!

356
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,100
I'm happy for you!

357
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,580
I'm going with him today for the contract.

358
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,450
He's going to meet the person from the head-quarter.

359
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,180
Oh, really?

360
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,070
If you can go with them, it's great.

361
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,480
Oh! Our Ra Hoon is now a business owner!

362
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,450
- Yes, I'm an owner now! 
   - I have to be nice to you!  

363
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm going to work with our Ba... with Ba Reun.

364
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,400
Owner Lee Ra Hoon, congratulations! Owner Ba Reun, congratulations!

365
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Ra Hoon, congrats! Ba Reun, congrats to you, too!

366
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,450
Thank you so much! We'll work our best.

367
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,370
Hey, Chae Woon. Isn't it time for your company to announce the transition to the full-time position?

368
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,260
Ah, yes. But don't have your hopes high.

369
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,190
The other intern that I'm competing with is very good as well.

370
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,020
What are you talking about it! He wouldn't be better than you.

371
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:13,140
- If you don't become full-time this time-- 
 - Hey, Chae Woon! You'll get it, so don't worry about it!

372
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,320
Noonim! Shouldn't we blow your lucky flower petal at this point?

373
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,710
Oh, about that...

374
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,270
Why? Did we already use all of them?

375
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,600
No, it's not like that.

376
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,810
I think that flower petal is not working anymore.

377
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,370
Last time, when Chae Woon's contest time, it didn't really work as well.

378
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,600
It eventually worked out!

379
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,000
Let's do something else!

380
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,000
Yes! That petal lost its power. It has been around a long time! It totally lost its power.

381
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Yes, everybody. Thank you for waiting. Then let's do Hwak Se's "Samgwang, Samgwang, fighting."

382
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,540
Everybody, gather here, please!

383
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,430
Okay. I hope Mr. Woo's important contract goes well,

384
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,040
and Ra Hoon taking over the food truck goes well as well!

385
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,050
Yes, and our Bit Chae's work goes well as well!

386
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,050
I hope all of us do well!

387
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:13,510
Let's do this. Samgwang, Samgwang, fighting!

388
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,150
- Hello! 
 - Good morning!

389
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,970
Hello!

390
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,690
    
    

391
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,950
Yes.

392
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,800
I can't make Seo Yeon get unfair treatment anymore.

393
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,300
  If I don't get the full-time position this time, I really think there's something going on.  

394
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,120
  Why do you think like that? You might have a lower score than her.  

395
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,310
  No, I don't think so.  

396
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,600
I checked it, and we have a similar evaluation score.

397
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,100
  Well, isn't that because you got many important projects at the end of the term?  

398
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,640
It seemed like Director Jang is helping you a lot.

399
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,110
Anyway, you know that rumor is still going around!

400
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,470
  The rumor that Bit Chae Woon is the daughter of the CEO?  

401
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,820
  They said it's not true!  

402
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,200
  No, it's really suspicious.  

403
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,490
  Don't you think that's the reason why Bit Chae Woon and Director isn't getting along with each other?  

404
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,500
  Are you saying they're competing with each other because they're sisters?  

405
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,900
  I guess that can be a possibility.  

406
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
     

407
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,970
Bit Chae Woon, good morning.

408
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,400
Are you going to quit the company right away?

409
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,360
Aren't you going to quit the job if you don't get a full-time position?

410
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,020
It's a bit shameless to stay around in our company without having a decent position.

411
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,260
Thank you for worrying about me, director.

412
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,400
She's arrogant until the end...

413
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,710
I looked through your data throughout the time.

414
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,160
You're definitely better in skill-wise than Kim Dae Won.

415
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,580
I'm proud of you.

416
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,150
Thank you.

417
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
So...

418
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,590
I'm going to pick you.

419
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,300
The reason why I called you in today

420
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,110
is I wanted to apologize to you about yesterday.

421
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,360
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

422
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,670
I regretted it.

423
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:56,300
But if you pick me this time, you'll suffer from a lot of misunderstanding and speculation again.

424
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,450
I think so as well.

425
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,380
But instead, you can do great job to cover up all those speculations, right?

426
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:14,790
I think my individual data is better than Kim Dae Won,

427
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,240
but he will have a better overall evaluation.

428
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,210
That's how the evaluation program is structured.

429
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,800
I thought about this a lot.

430
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,300
But don't choose me, CEO.

431
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Even if you choose me, I'll turn it down.

432
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,200
Then, are you going to quit and leave like you said yesterday?

433
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,300
I'm not going to leave.

434
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,200
I'm going to start again from the bottom and make the way up.

435
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,830
Also, I'm going to go to school as well.

436
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,900
If you think that way, why don't you go to study abroad?

437
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,000
I want to do study abroad someday, but not now.

438
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,600
I still have a lot to learn in the field,

439
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,900
and I want to get married as well.

440
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,430
Oh, the personnel appointment is up now.

441
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,200
  Congratulations! 
   

442
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,620
  I told you so, Dae Won! I knew you'd get it.  

443
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,360
- Congratulations! 
 - Thank you!

444
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,100
Congratulations, Dae Won! I'm happy for you.

445
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,340
Thank you, Bit Chae Woon.

446
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,780
I'm sorry.

447
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,740
Why are you being sorry? Congratulations.

448
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,540
- You should get us something! 
 - Yes!

449
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,800
  - I knew you'd get it. 
 - Thank you!  

450
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,600
  If you want to stay in the company as a contract position,  

451
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,620
  your work will be different from now on.  

452
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,200
  It means it's going to be hard. Will that be okay with you?   
 I'm sorry!

453
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,200
I'll help you.

454
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,470
It's fine.

455
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,870
Why is Makjang not coming here?

456
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,050
Hello, Mr. Makjang? Where are you?

457
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,900
I'm a bit sick right now.

458
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,100
  You're lying! You just don't want to come here.  

459
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm really sick...

460
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,700
The office is too cold.

461
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,700
Ah, cold...

462
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,800
It's freezing! Why is it so cold in here?

463
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,690
Mr. Makjang!

464
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,580
Mr. Makjang! Mr. Makjang!

465
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,500
- I'm so cold... 
 - Why did you not turn on the heater? Is the heater not working?

466
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,000
- I couldn't pay for it, so the gas is not coming in anymore. 
 - What?

467
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,100
- Why didn't you turn this on at least? 
 - That's broken.

468
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,830
How much didn't you pay for the gas to stop?

469
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,490
You had been paying me the whole time.

470
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,130
I was paying your paycheck instead of the gas.

471
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,640
Oh, no! Let's go to the hospital now!

472
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,000
- Don't take off my blanket. 
 - But we should go to the hospital!

473
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,400
- Put my blanket back on. 
 - Stand up! Ah!

474
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,950
You're very pretty.

475
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,010
Do you have a headache?

476
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,480
I don't have a headache. I said it wrong. You're not pretty. Give my blanket back.

477
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,200
I guess you're very sick.

478
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,580
You're not pretty...

479
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,750
It's just a common cold.

480
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,060
- I got surprised. 
 - Why is it so cold in here? That's why he caught a cold!

481
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,930
- Thank you for coming here, aunt. 
 - Your welcome.

482
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,150
Let's go for now.

483
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,740
- Where? 
 - Where are we going?

484
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,000
We should go somewhere warm. You'll be sick even more if you stay in this cold room!

485
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,120
Where do you live?

486
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,440
I'm not going to tell you where I live.

487
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,630
- His home is far away, somewhere in a rural village. 
 - Oh.

488
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,400
He looks like a city boy.

489
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,100
- Aunt. 
   - Yes?  

490
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,330
I'm very dizzy right now, so I can't stand up.

491
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,100
Right. If you're dizzy, then you can't stand up.

492
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,240
Then, there's no choice. I'll piggyback him until the taxi stop.

493
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,200
Hae Deun, grab his legs. In three, grab his legs up.

494
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
- You want me to hold him up? 
 - Yes. I'm going to piggyback him.

495
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,220
- Okay, pull him up in three! 
 - I don't think this is a good idea.

496
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,500
- I can carry you. 
 - It's not a good idea, aunt!

497
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,900
One, two, three!

498
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,930
Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Oh, no!

499
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,650
- Oh, my god! Mr. Makjang! 
 - Help me...

500
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,130
Wait!

501
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,460
You don't look like a person who's sorry.

502
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,200
What? Ttak Bae, I'm not a person who does that kind of a small business!

503
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,710
  Please help me with this, hyung! Think as a part-time job.  

504
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,000
  You're the best at talking! I'll pay you a lot.  

505
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,340
How much are you going to pay me?

506
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,220
You bastard, you should pay me more than that!

507
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,080
Koala! Are you on the way to make the contract?

508
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,500
Yes. I'm about to go inside.

509
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,400
I called you to wish you good luck.

510
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Thank you. Did you meet up with Ra Hoon for the food truck?

511
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,400
  I'm on my way there.  

512
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,980
Ah, if it weren't for this contract, I would've come with you.

513
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,100
It's okay. You can come by and see it later. Then, good luck with your work!

514
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,700
I might not be able to call you right away. I have to go around multiple departments for a briefing.

515
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,720
I get it. Let's eat something delicious tonight.

516
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,000
Sounds great.

517
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,440
Moong-i, I love you.

518
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,700
I love you, too, Koala!

519
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,070
I'm so nervous, Ra Hoon.

520
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,860
Don't be nervous.

521
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,200
- You're so frozen right now. 
 - What?

522
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,700
I'm not frozen! I'm fine! My goodness...

523
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,130
You're cute.

524
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,530
Don't be nervous!

525
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
- I'm not nervous. 
 - Let's take a picture!

526
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,580
- A picture? 
 - It's the historic first day of our business.

527
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,500
Sure.

528
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,480
Oh! Excuse me.

529
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,800
Are you the chief Ko from PH Food?

530
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,600
Yes, that's me.

531
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,000
Hello! It's nice to meet you.

532
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,740
- Hello. 
 - It's very nice to meet you.

533
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,290
It's so good to meet you.

534
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,820
Why don't we have a seat?

535
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,500
Yes, sure.

536
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,000
We read the headquarters guide book thoroughly.

537
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,700
And we have a couple of things to ask you.

538
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,990
- First of all, the food truck's menu-- 
 - Wait.

539
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,200
Don't do this.

540
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm sorry?

541
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,500
This is not a good thing. Don't do this work.

542
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,000
What are you talking about it? We looked up, and it looked nice.

543
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,280
The company where provides the menu is a famous place as well.

544
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,890
No. This is bait! Anyway, don't take over this one, and find another place.

545
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,500
Chief Ko, didn't you come from the headquarter?

546
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm sorry. I should go.

547
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,200
Oh! I'm sorry, guys.

548
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,100
- Noona. 
 - Hello--

549
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,270
Park Pil Hong.

550
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,270
I'm sorry!

551
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,220
Park Pil Hong!

552
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,800
- Big noona! 
 - Unni!

553
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,590
Park Pil Hong! Wait!

554
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,900
Don't follow me! You might fall!

555
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,700
We should talk!

556
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,420
Seo Yeon!

557
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
You were going to scam on my brother, weren't you?

558
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,300
The food truck and the company, those are all lies, aren't they?

559
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,850
I didn't know it's going to be your brother!

560
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,600
Also, I just came out here because an acquaintance asked me to help him.

561
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,330
But I recognized your brother, and told him not to take this!

562
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,170
If it weren't my brother,

563
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,200
then were you going to scam the person?

564
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,770
Why are you doing this kind of work?

565
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,200
Do you know how much my brother was happy about this opportunity?

566
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,340
That money!

567
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,380
Do you know how hard he saved that money?

568
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,900
- That's why I told him, honestly! Don't do this! 
 - If it weren't for my brother, you would've scam the person!

569
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,300
All those money that people saved really difficultly, you were going to take all of it!

570
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:06,010
Well, I'm not the person who's taking that money directly. I was just here to explain the business.

571
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:11,300
- Because I'm good at communicating, so I'm pretty famous in this field. 
 - Park Pil Hong!

572
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,850
Did you live like this the whole life?

573
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,100
Were you like this before as well, so that's why you made my mom sick, and you went to jail?

574
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Why?

575
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,700
Why did you finally show up before me?

576
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,700
In this terrible form! Why?

577
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,900
Seo Yeon.

578
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,390
I'm sorry.

579
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,800
I have a plan.

580
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,920
Even though I lived a life full of regret, but I remorse about it.

581
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:55,150
- I'll get back on my feet as soon as possible, so I can be your proud father-- 
 - Stop right there.

582
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,820
Please get away from my sight.

583
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,700
I don't need a dad.

584
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,060
I don't have a father.

585
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,810
So...

586
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,960
Please go far away to where I can't even hear about you.

587
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,600
Please...

588
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Please, I want you to do that.

589
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
Seo Yeon..!

590
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,700
Really! There's a big misunderstanding between us.

591
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:36,700
Okay, Seo Yeon. I'll never come back in front of you in this horrible form.

592
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,000
I have an important plan, so I should get going.

593
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,680
Where are you--

594
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,860
Where are you going?

595
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,400
Are you going somewhere else to scam other people?

596
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,720
You should put some ointment on your knee, okay?

597
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,100
My goodness!

598
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,010
You're not going to make any trouble, right?

599
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,420
Park Pil Hong!

600
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,200
- Big noona. 
 - Unni!

601
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,100
What's going on?

602
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,780
Who was that guy?

603
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,000
Is he really a scammer?

604
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Unni! Did you get hurt here?

605
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,500
  Oh, no...  

606
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,040
I guess Woo Jung Hoo is not coming.

607
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,400
Jung Min Jae!

608
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,100
They said we should come here 10 minutes before the session.

609
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,500
I'm sorry. There's heavy traffic.

610
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,090
You fall easily! You shouldn't run.

611
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,690
Let's go inside.

612
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,650
I didn't know they had a space like this.

613
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,200
Be careful!

614
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,100
Welcome.

615
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,720
This room is a bit different, right?

616
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:41,970
Yes! I only met you in your office.

617
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,860
Today is a day we just talk comfortably.

618
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,200
I don't have that much time right now.

619
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,440
It wouldn't take that long.

620
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,300
- Did you bring your emotionally attached objects? 
 - Ah, yes.

621
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,780
This is it.

622
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,700
  That's so cute!  

623
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,000
What about you, Mr. Woo Jung Hoo?

624
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,350
Yes...

625
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,400
That's great! Who wants to talk about it first?

626
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,780
Why don't you go first? You said you're busy.

627
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,640
S-Sure.

628
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,300
Then, you should go to the next room and fill out the questionnaire.

629
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,580
Yes.

630
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,220
You look good in that outfit!

631
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,400
This is another room that I've never been to.

632
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,100
Take your time and fill this out, please.

633
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,650
Ah, yes.

634
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,770
Oh, wait. I did this before--

635
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:05,700
  When was the happiest moment in your life, Mr. Woo Jung Hoo?  

636
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,200
Well...

637
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,390
I bet it was when you made tons of money.

638
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,700
When the sales have gone up dramatically,

639
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,700
or is it going to be when you pay off all of your debt?

640
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:33,040
Ah, when you first went to see the movie with your first love, Soon Jung?

641
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:40,800
The happiest time in my life was when my wife had our Jae Hee, I mean when she gave birth to our son.

642
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,600
His mother and father liked it that we had a son.

643
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,670
  My wife was in labor for more than 18 hours.  

644
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,400
But I couldn't be with her because of my company's work.

645
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,690
I couldn't focus at work at all,

646
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,150
but I'm the person in charge, so I couldn't get out of it.

647
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:12,040
What if something happens to her?

648
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,090
I thought I was losing my mind.

649
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:22,650
After working until dawn, I ran to the hospital,

650
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,390
but she wasn't in the labor room.

651
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,610
I thought something happened to her.

652
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,020
I was terrified.

653
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,610
But then,

654
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,210
I went to the hospital room...

655
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:58,500
She was drinking kelp soup in a huge bowl and smiling.

656
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:06,600
I was really happy at that moment.

657
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,920
  She's alive!  

658
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,600
  Since she's eating well, she's fine.  

659
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,980
At that time, I was really...

660
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,050
I was really happy.

661
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,430
  Yes. It must have been a happy time.  

662
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,800
Then, can I ask, what do you regret the most?

663
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:47,450
  If it's a tough question for you to answer, then you don't have to talk about it.  

664
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,820
I bet it would've been the time when he started a business with a friend that he trusted.

665
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,000
He got fooled by his friend, lost a lot of money, and was chased by debt collectors.

666
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,870
  If it's uncomfortable for you to answer, then you can talk about it next time.  

667
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,860
My wife...

668
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,600
and my son, I wasn't nice to them.

669
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:22,000
I was a cranky, stubborn, and stingy guy to them.

670
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:30,130
I took care of my parents, my siblings, and even my relatives.

671
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,000
I paid for all of their living expenses and tuition,

672
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,800
but I always told my wife to save electricity and water.

673
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:46,690
  I said to her that "you don't know that money is precious because you don't go out and make money!"  

674
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,500
  I see.  

675
00:47:54,790 --> 00:48:00,370
Can I ask you why you did that?

676
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,650
In this whole world,

677
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,400
I thought she was the one whom I can take for granted.

678
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:21,620
I thought I could walk all over her.

679
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:30,000
Actually, it was really hard for me to make money to support my parents

680
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,065
and take care of my younger siblings.

681
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,400
Sometimes I hated it,

682
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,970
but I had to bear with it.

683
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,600
Everyone was looking at me because I'm the oldest son.

684
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,710
I pretended to be okay when I'm outside,

685
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:58,300
  but I poured out all the annoyance and frustration from outside on her.  

686
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,090
Because I thought it was okay for me to do that to her.

687
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:12,699
Because I knew it well that my wife loves me so much.

688
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:20,200
So I thought I could treat her like that.

689
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,000
I didn't know...

690
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:38,200
that was growing into a wound in her heart.

691
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,280
  I really didn't know about that...  

692
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,280
Did it go well?

693
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,700
Of course!

694
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,700
- How about you? 
 - It was fine.

695
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,530
Your eyes got red.

696
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,100
I sneezed a bit hard.

697
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:22,690
Do you want to go somewhere and have Soondae soup with me..?

698
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,560
I have a plan.

699
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh, right. I have to go to the jokbal place for my part-time job.

700
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,800
Then, why don't we say bye here, Jung Min Jae?

701
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,720
Okay, you should go, Woo Jung Hoo.

702
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,930
Yes, then.

703
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,980
What's the point of realizing it now?

704
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,160
It's all over now.

705
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,160
     

706
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,040
Yes, Soon Jung!

707
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,700
Soon Jung! Welcome to my place.

708
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,800
How have you been?

709
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,660
Your place is wonderful!

710
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,200
      
 That's really nice.

711
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,700
- Take this, please. 
 - Thank you! It's very pretty!

712
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,470
How can your taste for choosing flowers so similar to your daughter?

713
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,200
Are you talking about Chae Woon? She has a similar taste to me.

714
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,120
Soon Jung. You're here to persuade me, aren't you?

715
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,760
That you and Woo Jung Hoo has nothing in between.

716
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,650
You already knew about it.

717
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,800
Why don't you read this?

718
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,700
Oh, this is... How can I..?

719
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,200
This is my diary that I wrote a long time ago.

720
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,900
Did you still keep your old diaries?

721
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,500
This is a precious one! I didn't know you kept a diary.

722
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,000
Well, you wanted to be a writer, so it's not surprising, I guess.

723
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,900
But why do you want me to read this..?

724
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,420
It's a bit embarrassing,

725
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,500
but I thought it might help you to understand the situation at that time.

726
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:44,250
It's too embarrassing for me to show you the whole entries, but...

727
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,240
Why don't you read this part?

728
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,960
Oh, my. Is it really okay for me to read this?

729
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,400
Yes, it's okay.

730
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,400
Oh, my...

731
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,480
Today's a very sorrowful day.

732
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,470
  Today's a very sorrowful day.  

733
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,700
  It's because I realized Jung Hoo oppa's real feeling.  

734
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,100
  Actually, I...  

735
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,520
  Actually...  

736
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,540
  I like Min Jae.  

737
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,700
  I guess you must be surprised.  

738
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,430
  Whenever I'm around Min Jae, we are always fighting.  

739
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:42,740
  I'm trying to be nice to her, but somehow it doesn't work like that.  

740
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:49,700
  Jung Hoo oppa had feelings for Young lady Min Jae.  

741
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,000
  I had no clue.  

742
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,730
  I really didn't know about it at all.  

743
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:06,600
  I can't believe there was someone else in Jung Hoo oppa's heart  

744
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,300
  who was the only consolation in my life.  

745
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,470
  It's very sorrowful.   

746
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,290
  What should I do with this sorrow?  

747
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,500
Soon Jung, I didn't know about this.

748
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,890
Has your misunderstanding been cleared up a bit now?

749
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:41,550
But then, why did he treat me like that?

750
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,400
Soon Jung, you would have been upset at this time.

751
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,300
Yes, I was upset at that time because I had a crush on him.

752
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,800
But now it's all a good memory.

753
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,000
When I see both of you from the side,

754
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,540
I can tell that you both have feelings for each other still.

755
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,400
Oh, no. It's not like that! That's not true!

756
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,400
- Please, have some tea. 
 - Yes.

757
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,490
What a strange thing.

758
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,300
Be careful, be careful!

759
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,100
- Careful! 
 - Let's lie down right here.

760
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,300
I'm sorry, I must have been heavy to carry.

761
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:51,640
  - Thank you, uncle!  
 - It's nothing!

762
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:57,700
By the way, I guess you are really sick! Your whole body is burning like a campfire.

763
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:02,700
He took some medicine, so it'll go down soon. Why don't you lie down and have some rest?

764
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,900
Yes, thank you so much.

765
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,740
Don't worry about it. I guess he can't lie down because we're around! Let's go outside. Have some rest!

766
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,520
Have some rest.

767
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,820
Where are you going?

768
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,240
- What's wrong? 
 - Don't go!

769
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,830
Let's go back up to the bed!

770
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,460
Are you okay?

771
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,940
- What's wrong? 
 - Don't go. Stay here.

772
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,900
Why don't you lie down first?

773
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,220
Are you okay? Did you eat something?

774
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,680
I didn't eat anything yet.

775
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:44,710
How can't you haven't eaten yet? I'll make you some porridge.

776
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,750
It feels like your fever went down a little bit.

777
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:59,200
  I guess you're worried about me a lot. You're so cute!  

778
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,770
Why is he laughing?

779
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:06,410
Did he lose his mind because of a high fever?

780
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,920
Yes, I think I'm a bit off right now.

781
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,600
Are you okay?

782
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,830
I'm not okay.

783
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,200
- Can you see it in the front? 
   - I can see with my eyes.  

784
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,240
- Hwak Se. 
 - Yes?

785
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,000
It was hard, right? Thank you.

786
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,790
It was nothing! I'm very strong, you know.

787
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:35,000
Because of that, I came home with you, so I'm happy.

788
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,700
I'm happy, too.

789
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:43,460
I guess noonim went to work.

790
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:50,300
Then, Jjung-a, why don't we kiss in the meantime?

791
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,500
- Hae Deun will come inside soon. 
 - Don't worry about it.

792
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,900
I'll look around like this.

793
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:18,010
What should I do? How am I going to get out of this room?

794
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,300
I can't hide it anymore.

795
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,100
- Forget about it. Let's tell everything. 
 - Wait, wait!

796
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,400
Why, all of a sudden?

797
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,020
What? Why not?

798
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,320
- Let's just tell them now! 
 - No, wait!

799
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:40,920
At least, when I pass the audition for the radio singing contest, can we tell them then?

800
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,050
- No, what's the difference? Let's just tell them now. 
 - Wait, wait!

801
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:54,900
I just want to have anything to make noonim feel secure about you dating me.

802
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:01,300
Thank you, Jjung--!

803
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,910
Man Jung...

804
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,840
Why did you two come out from that room?

805
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,160
Unni.

806
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,990
Yes?

807
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,410
- We... 
 - Wait!

808
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,130
We are in a relationship.

809
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,900
What?

810
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,500
We are dating.

811
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,200
  I'm sorry, Mr. Woo.  

812
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,700
  We decided to change our subcontractor.  

813
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:06,510
The contract will proceed smoothly.

814
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,400
Is the company you were going to sign a contract with was Woo Jae Hee construction company?

815
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,800
Yes. Didn't you know about that?

816
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,730
I thought you intervene this because his company is very small.

817
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,300
I feel bad for Mr. Woo. He worked really hard.

818
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:27,290
But I can't do much because I got told to do it from the top.

819
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
What? You didn't get the contract?

820
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,000
How come?

821
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,620
We were sure to get it!

822
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:38,110
It was. But it got changed at the last minute.

823
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,600
The company's management changed its contract at the very last minute.

824
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,830
This is driving me crazy...

825
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,100
I thought it would be a done deal, so the material company already brought all of the materials in!

826
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:50,940
What should we do with all the construction workers that we signed the contracts?

827
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:57,330
What should we do with all those debts that we pushed it until now?

828
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,690
Yes, president.

829
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,900
I'm sorry.

830
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,700
We didn't know this will happen as well.

831
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,000
Yes, hyungnim! I just heard about it as well.

832
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,860
I didn't expect this to come.

833
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,720
Mr. Woo! I heard you couldn't get the contract!

834
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,100
What are you going to do with the delayed construction cost?

835
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,100
President, I will fix that for you!

836
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,940
How are you going to fix that! Huh?

837
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:27,760
Mr. Woo, we know that you're suffering, too, but how are you going to fix it!

838
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,860
I'll take responsibility and fix it all. I'm so sorry.

839
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:37,320
What should we do now!

840
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,130
  I'm so sorry.  

841
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,730
Hey, Woo Jae Hee!

842
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,200
This bastard, you were here.

843
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,210
What are you doing now?

844
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,510
I took care of everything in the name of Park Pil Hong.

845
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:24,410
I guess Jae Hee will struggle for some time.

846
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,100
  He should've not offended our princess!  

847
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:35,130
But Jae Hee oppa will get through this well, right?

848
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,000
I was just going to make him scared a little bit, but the problem is

849
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:45,000
that he's business partner Yoo Do Hyun, even used private loans in secret to Woo Jae Hee.

850
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,500
Is that so?

851
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:56,070
This might be complicated.

852
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,800
    
   
    

853
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,990
Why is he still not texting me?

854
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,200
     

855
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:45,110
  The person you're trying to reach is unavailable now...  

856
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,600
Jae Hee...

857
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,080
     

858
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,390
     

859
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,800
  Hello...  

860
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,100
You did this, didn't you?

861
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,900
What is going on!

862
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,130
Please, don't misunderstand me.

863
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:12,420
I just got some information, so I wanted to tell you.

864
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:21,030
Your father, Park Pil Hong, made Woo Jae Hee couldn't get the contract.

865
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,000
  He got a bribe and stole the blueprint.  

866
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,610
  And he worked as a broker in between.  

867
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,000
Why would Park Pil Hong do that?

868
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,800
Why would Park Pil Hong screw Jae Hee!

869
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,670
You know about it.

870
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:41,300
He does anything if you give him money.

871
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:45,510
  He doesn't even care about his child in front of money, that old man.  

872
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:58,630
I'll see if there's any way I can help.

873
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,390
What do you mean you're going to help?

874
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,560
You're all the same people!

875
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,820
I hope you can pull yourself together, Bit Chae Woon.

876
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,600
Hwang Na Ro... Hwang Na Ro...

877
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,800
Hwang Na Ro!!

878
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,970
     

879
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,300
     

880
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,600
Jae Hee.

881
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,500
Jae Hee.

882
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:15,510
Jae Hee. Are you okay?

883
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:28,120
Did you get hurt?

884
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:34,630
What happened? Who did this to you?

885
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,290
Chae Woon.

886
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:49,780
I'm fine.

887
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm fine.

888
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:00,830
I'm sorry...

889
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,940
I'm really sorry...

890
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:17,510
♫   When the memories are fading   ♫

891
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:23,200
♫   I stand on the street where we walked together   ♫

900
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,590
  Unni, can you just tell me your honest feeling?  

901
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,100
  I don't like you two dating. Bring someone who's a doctor like you!  

902
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,100
  Can't I say that as your sister?  

903
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:23,630
  Man Jung! Man Jung!  

904
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,450
  Please help Jae Hee. I'm your granddaughter as well.  

905
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,000
  Please take some pity on me, grandmother.  

906
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,800
  Seo Ah, please help me.  

907
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,900
  - You should convince the Chairwoman and make this right. 
 - Jae Hee.  

908
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,770
  There's no reason for the Chairwoman to ruin your work.  

909
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:40,530
  - I didn't do it! 
- If it's not you, then why would the company related to the Chairwoman intervene in the contract?  

910
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,420
  I'm sorry, Jae Hee.  

911
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,620
  If you didn't meet me, you didn't have to go through this.  

912
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:47,820
  It's fine! Mr. Woo is a wealthy family's son!  

913
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:51,180
  I'm ashamed that you are my father.  

914
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,200
  I have someone to report.
