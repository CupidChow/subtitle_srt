1
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,300
Wait! 
      

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,080
Why are you taking him for what?

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,100
Seo Yeon, I'm okay.

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,100
Are you his family?

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,930
Are you his daughter?

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,030
No. I don't have any relationship with him.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,170
Then, we can't tell you anything.

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,700
What? Park Pil Hong got caught by the police?

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,600
I thought you reported him.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,400
  Do you think I'm crazy? What would I know he would say to the police!  

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,150
Anyway, Park Pil Hong is caught by the police, so please keep my promise.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,900
The promise that you said you'll resolve the contract that Jae Hee didn't get it. We don't have time to wait.

13
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,270
I don't know if Park Pil Hong getting caught by the police will be good for me or not.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,700
  - How can I trust you and help you? Let's hang up for now.   
 - Chairwoman!

15
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,730
Who reported Park Pil Hong to the police?

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,170
Yes. Please investigate thoroughly of Park Pil Hong.

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,780
If you need it, then I'll come in as a deponent.

18
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,350
Yes, thank you.

19
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,710
If you can give me a little more time, then I'll take care of this no matter what!

20
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,190
- I said no. 
 - Sir! Sir!

21
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,310
You know better than I am that we're struggling right now.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,980
You said you'd send the money yesterday, but you still didn't pay me!

23
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,650
I'm sorry, but can you give me a bit more time?

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
Stop apologizing and just send me the money.

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm sorry. It's not possible for you to get any more loans.

26
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,200
     

27
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,370
Yes, mom!

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,550
No, I'm not busy.

29
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,930
I guess you called me because you're worried about Jae Hee.

30
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,000
  Yes. Mr. Woo didn't even eat breakfast and left early.  

31
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,600
Right. I think he's busy taking care of his company's issue.

32
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,750
Don't worry! He'll figure it out well.

33
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,130
  Of course. I believe so.  

34
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,750
By the way, Chae Woon.

35
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,600
I was just wondering. Maybe somebody did it on purpose to ruin his contract?

36
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,800
Did you hear anything about that possibility?

37
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,340
Well, they are looking in that direction as well.

38
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,040
I guess Mr. Woo is not the kind of person who will make enemies.

39
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,180
  If you get any new information, then let me know!  

40
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,780
Yes, mom.

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,790
Oh! Are you guys going out for work now?

42
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,660
Yes, mother.

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,710
Mom. Jae Hee hyung's work didn't go well, right?

44
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,730
Right, it didn't go well.

45
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,790
Mom, I just thought about this when I heard you talking on the phone.

46
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:25,730
I think there is somebody that will have a grudge over him.

47
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,030
Who?

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,620
I heard that Park Pil Hong is in the police station right now.

49
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,440
He got caught quicker than I expected.

50
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Who do you think reported him? Jae Hee oppa? Or maybe Bit Chae Woon?

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
If Park Pil Hong just gets arrested and stays in prison, that will be the best,

52
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,820
but it might affect if it doesn't go that way.

53
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,810
To us?

54
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
No, to me.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,700
When everything gets revealed, the Chairwoman made I'll get blamed for everything.

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,600
If you knew about it that well, then why did you agree to do this? Did you want to get a favor from my grandmother?

57
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,590
Do you think that's all I care about it?

58
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,100
It's because I love you, Seo Ah. This is what you wanted to do.

59
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,600
Even if there's something happens, you wouldn't have any trouble. I'll take it all on me.

60
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,890
You were the one who reported, mom?

61
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,500
Yes. It's not just me, but other subcontractors of Jae Hee also reported Park Pil Hong.

62
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:38,320
By the way, the police came to take him away when you were with him?

63
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,410
Yes.

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,300
Oh, no! You shouldn't see all that.

65
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm fine.

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,490
You must be the one who is going through a hard time.

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,770
You had to report him by yourself.

68
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,290
No, it's okay. If I didn't report him, he might make bigger trouble.

69
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,650
And moreover, he must be harmful to you.

70
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,600
I really wished him to have a new clean life.

71
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,930
You think I stole the blueprint from Woo Jae Hee's company? And I gave that to the rival company? Why would I do that?

72
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,220
I bet you did it for the money. You also delivered the bribe directly to get the contract signed.

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,810
What's that? That's absurd. Who reported me?

74
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,890
Is it a person in the construction company? Let me meet the person.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,800
No, first of all, let me see the Chairwoman Lee Choon Seok of LX company.

76
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,800
Right. Since you kept asking to see the Chairwoman, so we contacted her,

77
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,700
but she said she doesn't know you.

78
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,060
Is that so? I knew she would say that when she didn't answer my call.

79
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,210
Then, Woo Jae Hee. Let me talk to Woo Jae Hee in person.

80
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,410
Chae Woon.

81
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,530
Ah, Jae Hee.

82
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,000
I didn't hear you coming.

83
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,050
What are you doing here? You should go to work!

84
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,160
I should go now.

85
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,110
It's a bit messy here, so...

86
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,000
If the surroundings are organized, then you'll feel better and will get more good energy.

87
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Why are you doing this? If people flooded in here, it'll be destroyed again, so why do you put in an effort!

88
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,750
Jae Hee...

89
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,690
I'm sorry, Chae Woon.

90
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,190
You should go. I'll clean the place, so please, just leave now.

91
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
Jae Hee.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,400
When things are like this, we should pull ourselves together more. Why are you shaken so much?

93
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,800
I don't know what happened between you and your father, but let's get help from your father for now--

94
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,700
You are saying the same thing!

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,350
If I get help from my father, everything will be resolved.

96
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,300
Whenever I go to people to ask for money, everybody said that to me.

97
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:21,550
Why are you doing all this when you can ask for money from your wealthy father and pay off the debt and live comfortably!

98
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,600
Do you think the same way?

99
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,250
Don't you know why I'm doing this?

100
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,150
Don't you know why I'm struggling to make a living?

101
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,340
Aren't you the one who should understand me at least?

102
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,900
Jae Hee...

103
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,390
I'm not in a sane mind right now.

104
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,320
I don't know why I'm doing this to you. I'm sorry, Chae Woon.

105
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,080
Chae Woon, I'm sorry.

106
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,900
No, it's okay.

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,600
You can be like this to me, or who else you'll do it?

108
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,000
You can pour more onto me. I'm fine.

109
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,460
Jae Hee, don't keep everything inside and suffer by yourself.

110
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,380
You can vent more on me. I'm really fine.

111
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,300
  Jae Hee.  

112
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,460
- Jae Hee. What are you going to do now? 
 - Hyungnim.

113
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,990
How can you do this to me?

114
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,730
We were like a family working hard together.

115
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,500
How can you betray me like this?

116
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,200
- Sir, it's not like that. 
 - Chae Woon.

117
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Hyungnim, I'm sorry. It happened so suddenly.

118
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,460
You bastard!

119
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,810
What should I do now? What should I do with my people in my company?

120
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,520
What should I do with my own family!

121
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,420
I deeply apologize. I'll take responsibility for your factory to have no trouble!

122
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,440
I'm really sorry.

123
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,100
I know you're devastated as well, but how can you take care of my factory?

124
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,060
I know your situation!

125
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,720
I know that you're overwhelmed as well...

126
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,990
  Mother!  

127
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,180
- Jae Hee. 
 - Mom!

128
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,800
What is... what is going on..?

129
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,920
Mother!

130
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,000
- Mother. 
 - What is going on here?

131
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,100
Did our Jae Hee do something wrong to you?

132
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,780
Did he not pay your money back? How much is it?

133
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,490
- I'll be back next time. 
 - I'll pay it for you! How much did he not pay back to you?

134
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,020
Jae Hee, what is--

135
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,200
Did you get hurt? Who hit you?

136
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,400
Who made you like this? What happened?

137
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,020
- Jae Hee's mom, let's go outside for now. Let's go out. 
 - Let me go!

138
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,490
It's all because of you.

139
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,850
It's all because of you!

140
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,860
It's all because you kicked Jae Hee out.

141
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,710
It's all because of you, so Jae Hee had to leave the house since college and had to suffer, and now it became like this!

142
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,600
That's why this happened. That's why--

143
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,930
- Mom! Are you okay? 
 - Mother!

144
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,070
You should've not come here all of a sudden!

145
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,090
It's all because of you...

146
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,930
It all happened because of you...

147
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,240
Jae Hee...

148
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,100
I knew I had a weird dream.

149
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,300
You know that my dream is pretty accurate, right?

150
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,860
Especially when it comes to you, Jae Hee, my dreams always got it right.

151
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,660
What are you talking about it? There were tons of times you got it wrong.

152
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,300
Listen. Do you know why dreams seem to predict something?

153
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,200
It's because you put the meaning into it.

154
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,620
If nothing happened this time, you would've forgotten about that dream.

155
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,460
So are you saying that I'm wrong?

156
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,600
If you two are going to fight, can you leave?

157
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,350
I have lots of things to figure out.

158
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,620
Jae Hee, what happened? Did you get a grudge from somebody?

159
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,240
How can a contract that you were 100% confident about becomes like this..?

160
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,350
Did Seo Ah do it?

161
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,660
  Seo Ah?  

162
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,560
Let's not assume somebody when we don't have any evidence.

163
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,720
Don't you have to go into the store?

164
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,220
Chae Woon, you should go to your work as well.

165
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,720
Yes.

166
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,430
- What about you? 
 - I have something to talk about with Jae Hee.

167
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,040
Jae Hee, I hope your panic disorder didn't come back, did it?

168
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,560
Chae Woon, did he have any symptoms like that?

169
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,190
There's nothing. I became okay a long time ago, what are you talking about it?

170
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,170
Mom, you should go. Please, leave now.

171
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,900
  Why don't you two should go to work?  

172
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,430
Chae Woon, I'm sorry for you to see this.

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,100
No, I'm okay. You must have been startled.

174
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,020
I'm shocked that Jae Hee kneeled down in front of a stranger.

175
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,700
I never even let him kneel in front of me.

176
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm not going to leave them alone when I found out who did this to our Jae Hee!

177
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,680
Seo Ah? Even if it was her, I'm not going to leave her alone.

178
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,910
I'm going to put that person into prison!

179
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,380
I'll pay for your debt.

180
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,790
But instead, close your office and come into my company.

181
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,800
Don't you remember?

182
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,610
I said I'm not going into your company, and I'm not going to inherit any of your money.

183
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,430
Who said I'm going to inherit you my fortune?

184
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,300
Don't you still know that you're not in a situation to consider your pride?

185
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,600
How can I not know that? I'm very aware of it.

186
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,870
I was running around early in the morning and apologized to everybody.

187
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,800
I feel so sorry for all those people suffering because of me, and I feel like I'm about to die!

188
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,600
That's why I'm saying. I'll help you!

189
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,470
When you have a father who can help you with it, why are you suffering for no reason?

190
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:01,730
  I'm going to bet my precious 100 won to that you'll come to me seeking help in a couple of years!  

191
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,240
What if I don't have a father who can help me?

192
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,980
What if I don't have a wealthy father?

193
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,870
If I were a person who didn't have anybody to lean on?

194
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:27,860
I lived like that until now since we end our father and son relationship after graduating high school.

195
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,770
Do you think this is my first time struggling?

196
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,400
There was a time when I slept on a street and starved for days because I didn't have any money.

197
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Maybe I look like a positive person to other people, but I really struggled to make a living until now!

198
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,700
I lived until now with the idea that I have to figure out everything, and I don't have any person to take care of me!

199
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,650
You punk!

200
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,040
Hey, what did I do that wrong?

201
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,500
Is it because... I didn't help your friend Bum Jin's father?

202
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,130
At that time, I was--!

203
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,050
Forget about it.

204
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,780
What should I do by making excuses now? It's all my fault.

205
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,530
Sure. You should figure it out all by yourself.

206
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:33,250
Like me when I was young, you might get beat up by debt collectors and get terrified for the rest of your life,

207
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,930
and even might go to prison sued for fraud. Do whatever you want to do.

208
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:55,100
Then, why were you nice to me when I lost my memory and lived in Samgwang villa?

209
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,700
I thought our relationship got restored at that time.

210
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,990
I was nice to you because it was James, not you.

211
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,900
Is that so.

212
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,070
I guess it would've been better if I didn't recover my memory.

213
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,330
Don't forget to eat well.

214
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
Also, don't forget to take medicines.

215
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,000
  Father--  

216
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,280
  It's all because of you, James. Thank you.  

217
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,400
  Your father must be happy since he has such a thoughtful son like you.  

218
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,400
Hwak Se! Don't clean the house, I'll do it later.

219
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,400
No, noonim, let me do it. Today, I want to do it.

220
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,980
You're going to your work later today. You should just have some rest for now!

221
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,570
Did you try calling Man Jung?

222
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,300
No, I didn't.

223
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,320
You should call her.

224
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:29,200
I tried multiple times, but she didn't pick up and got a reply saying she's busy working.

225
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,070
But if you call her, she'll be happy.

226
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,590
Sure.

227
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,630
No, actually, you should go see Man Jung and bring her back home today.

228
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,100
This is your homework for the day.

229
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,640
- But are you going somewhere right now? 
 - Yes, I'm going to see the CEO.

230
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,610
Did you get it? Please take Man Jung back home today.

231
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
I'll be back.

232
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,600
Noonim!

233
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,800
Yes, what's wrong?

234
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,460
Thank you for everything, as always.

235
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,480
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

236
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,510
You should do the homework well that I gave you!

237
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,590
And let's talk about it as the three of us together at dinner.

238
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,730
Have a nice meeting with the CEO, noonim.

239
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,770
- Stop cleaning the house and have some rest. I'll see you later! 
 - I'm fine. Okay!

240
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,100
Thank you for everything until now, noonim.

241
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,590
Thank you.

242
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,900
  Joon Ah, we should meet up. I have something to talk about Seo Ah with you.  

243
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:09,480
  It's not my style to hide like this when I'm working in my mom's company.  

244
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,000
Sure, I should tell.

245
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,120
I have to tell.

246
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,200
Thank you for your hard work. Let me introduce Kim Dae Won to you.

247
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,400
He was an intern in our Design team, and now he got a full-time position.

248
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,300
I'm Kim Dae Won. I'm going to work with you for the Online shooting team. I'll look forward to work with you!

249
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Nice to meet you!

250
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,800
Wait, then did my sister didn't get it?

251
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,560
What are you talking about it?

252
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,630
I can't believe that my sister didn't get the full-time position.

253
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,100
You didn't know that your sister didn't get the position until now when you're her sibling?

254
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,700
Nobody in my family knew about it.

255
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,670
Unni must have been disappointed.

256
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,400
That's Bit Chae Woon's fault! How can she not tell about it to the family?

257
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,400
Probably she didn't want us to be upset about it!

258
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,100
She's a very considerate person.

259
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,700
She's very considerate. It's not her fault at all.

260
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,840
I thought about it, and I think your family, including Bit Chae Woon, is all very considerate.

261
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,700
I'm pretty thoughtful.

262
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,700
That's what I'm saying.

263
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,770
Anyway! That old lady CEO Kim Jung Won, I don't like her after keep thinking about it.

264
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
That old lady..?

265
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,300
What about her?

266
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I mean, think about it. My unni must be more than qualified.

267
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,500
I bet since that lady is the CEO, she failed my sister on purpose to show everybody that she's fair.

268
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,900
There's also a rumor going around that my sister is her real daughter.

269
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,700
But she's the CEO of this big company! I doubt that.

270
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,960
What are you talking about it? She's the person who said her real daughter is not her daughter.

271
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,180
I get it. Stop yelling at me...

272
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,980
But did that really happen?

273
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,100
That's right. How can you know about all this stuff?

274
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,300
Right. I don't know about it.

275
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,900
- I should go see them. 
 - Who? The CEO Kim Jung Won?

276
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,800
Why do I see her? A different person. I'll be back soon.

277
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,800
Where are you going again?

278
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,100
I have to go somewhere.

279
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Why are you always going somewhere?

280
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,820
Why is this place so hot?

281
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,100
By the way, why was he like that all of a sudden?

282
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,800
It felt like he was hiding from somebody.

283
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,050
Why is it so hot in here?

284
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,190
CEO, your son is here.

285
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,500
- Joon Ah! 
 - Yes, mom. I'm here.

286
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,900
Joon Ah! My son!

287
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,100
What happened to you? You came right away after my text.

288
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,800
I have so many things to be sorry for you.

289
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,400
Now you even know what to be sorry. You've grown up!

290
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,110
- Let's have a seat. 
 - Yes.

291
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,700
How's your clothing store? Is it going well?

292
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,960
Yes, it's going alright...

293
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,160
- Mom, actually I am-- 
 - Joon Ah.

294
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,150
I texted you because I'm very sad and upset about Seo Ah these days.

295
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,210
Is that so? Right, about Seo Ah...

296
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,700
There's a guy that she got close to these days.

297
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,170
A guy? Who is that? Is it somebody not Jae Hee?

298
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,410
- Are you sure they are in a close relationship? 
 - I'm not sure about that.

299
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,270
It feels like she got close to him in defiance about Jae Hee.

300
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,620
But it looks like she has real feelings for him, too. I don't know what's right.

301
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,910
My goodness. But mom, maybe it's something like this.

302
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,930
Perhaps the guy is somebody who came close to her because of our money.

303
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,240
I believe you know it better, but Seo Ah looks very strong on the outside,

304
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:05,300
but she will fall head over heels when somebody takes care and please her.

305
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,770
That's why I'm so worried about her.

306
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,300
Yes!

307
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,150
I'm here instead of Director Jang to receive a sign from you.

308
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,970
- Where's she? 
 - She's in a meeting with the development team.

309
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,370
I brought it because I thought you need to review it now since it's something that we have to start working on right away.

310
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,400
You can leave it here and go.

311
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,230
Yes.

312
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,740
Hello.

313
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,500
- Did Seo Ah get a new secretary? 
 - We hired one more.

314
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,900
This is Seo Ah's older brother.

315
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,510
Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Na Ro.

316
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,340
Hello, I'm Jang Joon Ah. Nice to meet you as well.

317
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,000
But mom, did Seo Ah really hired him? It's a bit strange.

318
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,500
She doesn't employ close aides because she's so suspicious.

319
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,820
I'm not saying you're strange.

320
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,200
Oh? Oppa!

321
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,860
Why are you here?

322
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,570
- I thought you are in a meeting. 
 - It just got ended.

323
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,410
Na Ro, you brought that in by yourself. Thank you for doing that.

324
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,680
What is going on?

325
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,470
Then, I'll go back to work.

326
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,090
Right. Since you're here, I'll introduce him to you.

327
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,000
You don't have to introduce him to me again. I heard from mom that he's your new secretary.

328
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,860
That's right. And also,

329
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,000
he's the one I'm dating.

330
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,870
What? Did you just hold his arm?

331
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,700
Mom, then is the person you were talking about is this person?

332
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:52,710
Since we're all gathered today, why don't we have dinner all together? With Chairwoman as well.

333
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,540
Seo Ah.

334
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,400
What are you talking about it, Seo Ah? Why do we have dinner all together, even with the Chairwoman?

335
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,800
It'll upset my stomach. Also, I'm busy today.

336
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,260
Jang Joon Ah?

337
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,130
The way that bastard looking at me is disgusting.

338
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,270
Mr. Sideburn! Mr. Sideburn!

339
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,600
- Are you calling me? 
 - Yes!

340
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,800
- My name is not a sideburn, but Hwang Na Ro. 
 - What? It's a Hwang-sideburn?

341
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,450
I'm just joking. I'm not good at memorizing people's names.

342
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,350
- I heard from the CEO that you had been living in Samgwang villa. 
 - Yes.

343
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,000
Then I guess we have a great fate!

344
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,990
You know Jae Hee, right? Woo Jae Hee. He's my best friend.

345
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,340
- You must be friends with Jae Hee as well if you lived there, right? 
 - I'm not close with him.

346
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,170
Also, I don't live in the Samgwang villa anymore.

347
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,590
Oh, really? Oh, then I guess Mr. Sideburn is the one who lived in the downstairs room! I slept over there yesterday.

348
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,290
- Is he stupid? 
 - What did you say?

349
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,200
Nothing. My name is not sideburn, but Hwang Na Ro.

350
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,900
Oh, I keep making a mistake. I'm sorry. I'm really bad at memorizing names. What was your name again?

351
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,610
Sideburn?

352
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm sorry! It was a joke.

353
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,490
Are you really in a relationship with Seo Ah?

354
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,100
Yes.

355
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,110
For real? Are you really dating her?

356
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,840
Wow, your eyes! I guess you're really in a relationship with her.

357
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,100
Then, I guess you have infinite patience!

358
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,300
It's because Seo Ah's temper is no joke. Are you coping with all that?

359
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,560
I guess you really love her. Am I right?

360
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,360
By the way,

361
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,590
- do you know Woo Jae Hee is in a bad situation? 
 - I don't know about it. What's going on with him?

362
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,200
I guess you're not his best friend since you don't know about it.

363
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,500
I should go to a meeting.

364
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,100
Yes, you can go.

365
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,060
Why is that bastard keep talking casually to me?

366
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,300
I should look into him. He's suspicious.

367
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,960
What's going on with Jae Hee without telling me? Ah, ah!

368
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,150
I forgot to tell my mom about everything again.

369
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,310
How can I go in there again? I lost my timing.

370
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,000
- You have to come back in two days. Have a lot of water and rest. 
 - Thank you.

371
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,270
Why did they send so many messages?

372
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,000
Hwak Se didn't contact me at all.

373
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Is he mad?

374
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,150
Next patient, please!

375
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,010
Why are you here, Hwak Se?

376
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,620
Hello, doctor. I'm here to get some treatment.

377
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,440
What have you come in for today?

378
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,000
Do you have any problems at all?

379
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,930
Everything.

380
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,270
Before, I only had an issue with my throat, but now everything is not okay with me.

381
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,530
I think I got a terrible disease.

382
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,250
I think I got a bad disease that makes somebody suffer.

383
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,230
Did that somebody said they're suffering a lot?

384
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,890
I think so.

385
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,800
If that's the case, it's not your problem,

386
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,300
but that somebody is a terrible person.

387
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,250
A truly awful person.

388
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,710
I guess you were so upset because of me yesterday.

389
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,880
I threw a tantrum, left you alone, and ran out of the house.

390
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,680
I'm really sorry.

391
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,720
No! Why are you sorry?

392
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:55,570
Give me your hand. I think there's something on your hand.

393
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,220
This is the treatment. Didn't I cure your disease right away?

394
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,570
Doctor, I got cured already. You're the best!

395
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,960
Yes, I'm pretty good.

396
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,900
Unni told you to bring me back home, right?

397
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,320
Since you're here, I should pretend to give in and go home.

398
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,280
- I wasn't going to go home. 
 - Yes, you should go home.

399
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Weren't you cold to sleep here last night?

400
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,210
I thought I was going to freeze to death!

401
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:38,550
The wind blows through in this room. Maybe you should hug me warmly like this later at home.

402
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,890
Then, you should go now. I should see the patients.

403
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,190
You should go make money.

404
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,200
Then.

405
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,220
See you!

406
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,100
- Doctor. 
 - Yes?

407
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,330
One second.

408
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,030
Can you hug me for one time?

409
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:11,160
What are you doing at my workplace?

410
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,910
I guess you need a special prescription.

411
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,810
Well, if that's the case...

412
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,500
It's so good to see you like this.

413
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,200
- Right. 
 - Let's talk well with my sister later at home.

414
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,960
I love you.

415
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,600
- I should go now. 
 - Bye!

416
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
- Goodbye! 
 - Hurry up and go!

417
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,880
- Goodbye! 
    - Bye!  

418
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,280
  Excuse me.  

419
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,150
  You might get severely sick if you sleep here. 

420
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,800
  - Excuse me, young guy? 
 - Leave me alone!  

421
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,900
Noonim...

422
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,230
Noonim, you saved me.

423
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,730
I might not be able to pay back your kindness,

424
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,610
but I have to have a conscience.

425
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,950
Mom!

426
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,570
Hae Deun! I'm so proud of you, my daughter!

427
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,470
- Are you here to see the CEO? 
 - Yes.

428
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,370
But I still have some time to see her, so I came to see you first.

429
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,770
- Is your work enjoyable? 
 - Yes! I'm having so much fun.

430
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,920
- That's good. 
 - Ah, mom. About unni...

431
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,610
I just heard about this, but I think she couldn't get the full-time transition.

432
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,550
- Is that so? 
 - I think she must be disappointed.

433
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,460
It's all because of the CEO!

434
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,040
I asked you to see me because...

435
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:59,470
I thought the Chairwoman might be related to the case of Mr. Woo.

436
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:04,870
If that's the case, I feel like Mr. Woo got such big damage because of us.

437
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,270
The suspect that came out on the surface is Park Pil Hong.

438
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,340
Park Pil Hong?

439
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,530
How does he know about Mr. Woo?

440
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:21,330
Then, did Park Pil Hong was going around Chae Woon the whole time?

441
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,320
I think so.

442
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,860
He's getting investigated in the police station right now.

443
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,060
It's because I reported him.

444
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,860
Did you?

445
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:36,470
We have to wait and see if he's going to get prosecuted or not,

446
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,190
but he's getting investigated now.

447
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,160
Then, does Chae Woon knows about this as well?

448
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,540
Yes. She knows about it.

449
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,980
I feel like our adults are doing horrible things to Chae Woon.

450
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:06,110
I know that Park Pil Hong is the one who shook your life,

451
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:16,510
but I can tell it would've been a lot of pressure for you to make that decision to protect our Chae Woon.

452
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,640
Hwang Na Ro!

453
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,870
How have you been?

454
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,830
Hae Deun! What brings you here?

455
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,720
Are you working here now?

456
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,970
I got a contract position for the Online shooting team. It only has been a few days.

457
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,730
You look like a different person in a suit! You look pretty cool.

458
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,940
Is everybody doing good?

459
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,830
Not really. There's a lot going on.

460
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:54,070
How can you just move out without telling us? We were all surprised and sad.

461
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,770
I'm sorry.

462
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,750
The saddest person among us wants to see you now.

463
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,060
Mother!

464
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,950
Na Ro!

465
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,900
Mother, how have you been?

466
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,870
Do you know how sad I was when you left the house after just leaving a letter?

467
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,530
I'm so sorry.

468
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,560
Oh, this is..!

469
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,570
I wasn't going to wear this because you made me upset.

470
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,670
But it's so pretty not to wear it.

471
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,770
- Thank you for getting me this. 
 - It's nothing.

472
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:48,110
- It looks good on you. It's beautiful. 
 - Right? It's very pretty.

473
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,570
Hwang Na Ro!

474
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,570
Hello.

475
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,270
Are you here to see my mom?

476
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,770
Yes, Seo Ah. I'm here because of Mr. Woo's incident.

477
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,310
I believe you heard that his contract didn't go well.

478
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,760
Yes, I heard about it from my mom.

479
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,520
But why are you seeing Na Ro?

480
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,250
Ah, is it because he left the Samgwang villa all of a sudden?

481
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,070
Don't worry about him. He's doing well.

482
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,160
Then, I hope you have a nice meeting with my mom.

483
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,070
Na Ro.

484
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,890
- I'm just wondering, but you and Seo Ah..? 
 - Yes.

485
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,420
We are in a relationship.

486
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,870
Why is it so hard to contact you?

487
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,520
I'm sorry. I'm a bit busy these days.

488
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,970
Mr. Woo! Why are you coming now? I was waiting for you.

489
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,930
Detective, Mr. Woo will make everything straight.

490
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,610
He will make it clear that I didn't do anything wrong!

491
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:26,370
Then, are you saying Park Pil Hong didn't steal your company's blueprint?

492
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,510
Right.

493
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,970
- There was no sign of the blueprint getting stolen. 
 - See? You should've trusted me!

494
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,350
Be quiet.

495
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:44,170
Then did you know that he worked behind the scenes and bribed to steal the factory contract?

496
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,770
About that...

497
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,800
Mr. Woo, I didn't do that!

498
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:51,530
I went to that construction company for Chairwoman Lee Choon Seok, and that's when I knew about it!

499
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,270
That they were going to sign the contract with your company!

500
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,670
That grandma is framing me. She's trying to send me away into prison!

501
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,770
My god, Park Pil Hong!

502
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,580
About that, I don't know anything about it.

503
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,270
- I'm not sure if this person did it because of money or not. 
 - No, Mr. Woo!

504
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:19,960
Even though I need money, why would I ruin your work? You're dating my daughter! I didn't do it!

505
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,740
  Why didn't you tell me about this! Why!  

506
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,870
  Right now, Woo Jae Hee, you are the most certain victim.  

507
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:36,270
So if you sue Park Pil Hong, we can claim an arrest warrant.

508
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,960
According to your partner, Yoo Do Hyun, this person disguised his identity and stole someone's name,

509
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:49,870
and if that is proven to be an act to steal Woo Jae Hee's contract, then he'll get a charge with fraud as well.

510
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,930
Mr. Woo! You know why I used the name Lee Dong Chool! It's all because I wanted to see my daughter, Seo Yeon.

511
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,470
That's the only reason why I did that!

512
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,220
I didn't do anything bad. Please, save me!

513
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,240
I really didn't do anything!

514
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,520
Can I think about this until tomorrow?

515
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,170
Why don't you do that?

516
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:21,230
Mr. Woo! I'm Seo Yeon's father. Don't forget that I'm Seo Yeon's father.

517
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,550
Are you saying you're Chae Woon's father?

518
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:34,350
Do you really think you qualify to be her father?

519
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:43,250
Do you know how much Chae Woon is suffering and struggling all because of you?

520
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:49,570
If I only think about that, then I want to put you into prison right away.

521
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,670
Do you understand?

522
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,550
Woo Jae Hee.

523
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,470
- Chae Woon. 
 - Oh, mom.

524
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,070
Where's Mr. Woo?

525
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,970
I think he's busy with his company's work.

526
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,540
What should we do?

527
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:46,370
Chae Woon, in fact...

528
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:53,050
I heard about everything from the CEO.

529
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:58,650
I heard that Park Pil Hong is in the police station right now.

530
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,810
You heard about everything.

531
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,910
Yes.

532
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,300
Mom...

533
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:22,770
Yes, I know about it.

534
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,770
I know how you feel...

535
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,010
Big noona.

536
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,040
Yes, Ra Hoon.

537
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,970
I guess you must be very disappointed. You were excited about the food truck.

538
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,240
No, I'm fine! You are the one who must be upset.

539
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,570
By the way, was that person...

540
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,100
your biological father?

541
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,530
Yes.

542
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,310
Ah, I was right.

543
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,570
But he looked like a nice person.

544
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,730
Ra Hoon.

545
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:36,990
If you met your biological father and it turned out to be like that kind of person, then how would you feel?

546
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,670
I don't know.

547
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,670
I guess I'll ask him why does he do such kind of thing.

548
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,240
I'll wonder if he's really financially struggling. If that's the case, I can help him.

549
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,370
How can you help them financially?

550
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,570
I have some money that I saved to start the food truck business.

551
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:02,170
You worked really hard to save that money!

552
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:06,170
How can you give that money to a scammer father?

553
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:12,130
If I give that money, so my father doesn't have to do that kind of work, then it's worth it.

554
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,250
If he doesn't have to do that kind of work...

555
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:23,290
I don't know if that is a fixable thing.

556
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:29,390
But he might have ended up in that situation without his will.

557
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,970
He would've not been a person like that.

558
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,260
You're such a sincere person! Your gene would've come from somewhere!

559
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,270
Am I a sincere person?

560
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,610
- Yes. 
 - Maybe I'm an unexpected mutant!

561
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,490
Or maybe he might be the one.

562
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,600
Let me lie down here! It's been a long time.

563
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:04,220
But I want to see my birth father.

564
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,270
It can be better not to meet them.

565
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,980
But still...

566
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,250
Why are you here?

567
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,990
Jae Hee's father.

568
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,640
Can you please help Jae Hee?

569
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,880
I already...

570
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,870
I talked about that with Jae Hee, but he didn't want any of my help.

571
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,640
You don't have to listen to him!

572
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,590
He's never going to bend his pride down in front of you. He's just like you!

573
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,870
Please help with him.

574
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,570
I think something terrible might happen to him!

575
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,770
What am I suppose to do with him when he doesn't want any money from me?

576
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,070
Jae Hee's father...

577
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,570
Maybe you should help him!

578
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,070
Right.

579
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:23,150
I'll sell my apartment and help Jae Hee.

580
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:28,670
You don't even care about your own son. You only care about money!

581
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,830
Even if our son is devastated, you only care about the money!

582
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,270
You know it very well, Ms. Jung Min Jae.

583
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:44,500
Yes. I don't care about anything else but the money!

584
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,970
I forgot you were this kind of person. It feels stupid of me to ask for help from you.

585
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,390
Good night.

586
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,570
Wait...

587
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,100
Jae Hee's mom.

588
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:13,370
She still thinks I'm a ruthless stingy person.

589
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,760
  Chief Yoo!  

590
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:24,050
I think I can get some money for the private loan.

591
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,420
- I met somebody earlier, and I think I can borrow it from-- 
 - About that...

592
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,360
I paid back.

593
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,940
Really?

594
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,090
How?

595
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,480
Hey, How did you pay it back?

596
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,770
I heard that you paid for Chief Yoo's private loan.

597
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:04,470
I told you earlier that I'll take care of it by myself!

598
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:09,170
- Why did you do what I didn't even ask for-- 
 - Can't I do that as your father?

599
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:18,070
I lived my entire life until now as a ruthless stingy father.

600
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,650
But do I have to live like that for the rest of my life?

601
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:29,310
Can't you give me a chance to change myself?

602
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:33,870
I didn't give that money to you for free.

603
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,200
You can pay me back from now on.

604
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,870
I looked around to get some money the whole day.

605
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:46,690
- Even if it wasn't you, I found somebody who's going to lend me money! 
 - So you are saying

606
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:51,780
that you don't want to borrow even a dollar from me?

607
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,920
You don't want to give me a chance to act as your father?

608
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:01,720
Even though you're devastated, you don't want to lean on me?

609
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,990
Yes, I guess so.

610
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:18,670
I'll work hard and pay back the money that you lent.

611
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,960
Thank you.

612
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,070
You shouldn't drink soju on an empty stomach! You always get an upset stomach.

613
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,240
It's none of your business.

614
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:44,420
If you drink all of this, then what should I drink?

615
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,980
- Have a goodnight, father. 
 - What?

616
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:52,760
Hey! You should buy a new bottle before you leave!

617
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,070
Welcome, Young lady Min Jae.

618
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,070
I'm sorry to bother you late at night.

619
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:05,070
Jae Hee didn't come home yet, did he?

620
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:10,020
No. I guess you came here because you're worried about him.

621
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:21,730
- Mother, welcome. 
 - Bit Chae Woon.

622
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,610
Bit Chae Woon!

623
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,710
Chief Yoo! Is Jae Hee in the office?

624
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,270
Yes.

625
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:59,070
Did he go to the police station today?

626
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:02,370
I was really upset about that.

627
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:06,130
He can just put Park Pil Hong into prison with a charge of fraud,

628
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:11,070
but Jae Hee says he has to clear his false accusation, and he's trying hard right now.

629
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,140
A false accusation?

630
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,110
Yes, sir.

631
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:21,770
Park Pil Hong didn't interrupt the contract on purpose, but he got entangled in it without knowing it.

632
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:27,170
So I don't think we need to sue Park Pil Hong.

633
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,520
Right, I'm upset about that part as well.

634
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,690
But he's a nice person, and I think he got a false accusation.

635
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,730
I ask for your mercy.

636
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,910
Yes, sir. I'm so sorry. Yes!

637
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,170
Moong-i!

638
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:49,880
What are you doing now?

639
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:53,370
Why are you trying to help him?

640
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,090
I went to the police station, and it seems like Park Pil Hong got a false accusation.

641
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,880
I think the Chairwoman and Hwang Na Ro did it, but I couldn't get any evidence yet.

642
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,570
Why do you care if he got falsely accused or not?

643
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,850
He made you like this. He came to you with a fake identity!

644
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,250
Why do you forgive him!

645
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:16,670
Then what should I do? Should I just leave him like that?

646
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:22,130
If he gets arrested this time, he'll get aggravated punishment. We can't let him go to prison again.

647
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,770
Why not?

648
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,170
- If he did something wrong, then he should go to prison! 
 - He's your father!

649
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,070
How can I just leave him alone?

650
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,270
He's not my father.

651
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:36,190
That kind of person is not my father!

652
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:41,240
I'm not saying somebody who did wrong is innocent.

653
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,110
He got falsely accused. Are you just going to leave him alone?

654
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:50,270
He's not going to repent even though you take him out of this trouble.

655
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,060
He's never going to change!

656
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,040
He's going to make another trouble and make you suffer!

657
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,730
Why do you think like that? We should make him not do that!

658
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,120
In a way, I feel sorry for him, too.

659
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,270
If you keep being like this, then I can't be with you anymore.

660
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:16,330
How can I see you? How can I love you when I'm ashamed?

661
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:22,270
When you can even consider that person's mind in this situation, when you're taking responsibility for everything,

662
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:27,490
it makes me terribly sorry to you. So how can I be with you?

663
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,520
Chae Woon.

664
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,210
Then, should we...

665
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,520
stay apart for a while?

666
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:49,720
We can't get married right now since the situation is like this.

667
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,860
And I have to focus on fixing the problem for now.

668
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,450
Thankfully, I got a job today. It's a construction site work in Incheon.

669
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,240
I'll be there for a while.

670
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:05,370
Then, are you leaving the house?

671
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:13,520
I think I should work a lot and give my head some space.

672
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,980
When are you leaving?

673
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,460
Tomorrow.

674
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,280
Tomorrow?

675
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,890
How can you decide that without telling me--

676
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,270
  Why am I saying this?  

677
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,150
  I don't have the right to say it.  

678
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,780
One second.

679
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,170
Yes, sir!

680
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:48,370
  I'm sorry. I went around many places today, but can you extend the repayment date a little longer?  

681
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,870
  I know about it. I'm sorry.  

682
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:58,460
I'm going to a site in that area tomorrow, so I'll visit you when I'm there.

683
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,460
Yes, I'm so sorry, sir.

684
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:26,710
     

685
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:37,070
  Your mother is in your room right now. I hope you can come and comfort her.  

686
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,870
Jae Hee.

687
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:53,270
Why are you here like this? I'll call a cab, let's go home.

688
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,770
How did it go?

689
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,670
I gathered some money that I saved for emergency use.

690
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,300
- So-- 
 - I, um...

691
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,070
It got resolved well, mom.

692
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,070
What?

693
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:14,400
Father lend me the money to pay the urgent one.

694
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,430
Your father did that?

695
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,670
But before, he was...

696
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:23,110
Oh, I didn't know about that.

697
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:28,780
I extended the other loans' repayment dates, so don't worry about it, mom.

698
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,220
This is true, right? You're not lying to make me not worry about you, right?

699
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,270
Then you should check for yourself!

700
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,350
Let's go.

701
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,100
It's okay. I can go by myself.

702
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,410
Let me take you home, Ms. Jung Min Jae.

703
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,250
I'm sorry to bother you late at night.

704
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:07,370
It's okay. Don't forget to eat well, and brace yourself.

705
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,450
Yes, I will.

706
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:13,770
- Chae Woon, I'll see you later. 
 - Goodnight.

707
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,660
Unni.

708
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,330
- Man Jung! 
 - Auntie!

709
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:34,720
Man Jung!

710
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,320
Unni, I'm sorry.

711
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,890
- It's okay. 
 - I'm sorry.

712
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:46,270
Let's go inside, Man Jung. It's cold, let's go in.

713
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,970
I'm home!

714
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,410
What is it?

715
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,370
Huh? He wasn't at the jokbal place as well.

716
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,040
Wait...

717
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,200
Why there's nothing here?

718
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,350
What's going on?

719
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,360
Wait, did he leave?

720
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,670
Did Kim Hwak Se leave?

721
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,910
Wait a second...

722
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:00,010
  - Goodbye! 
 - Bye!  

723
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:10,370
Ah, he came to my office to say goodbye forever.

724
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,660
Man Jung, what's going on?

725
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,370
- Hwak Se didn't come home yet? 
 - What?

726
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,070
- Unni! 
 - Yes?

727
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:31,270
I think he left.

728
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:32,760
What?

729
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,770
I think he packed and left.

730
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,330
But why?

731
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:42,770
I don't know as well.

732
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,040
I guess he left.

733
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,910
My goodness, Man Jung.

734
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,060
Man Jung.

735
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,970
He'll be back!

736
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:07,670
Don't worry. He'll be back no matter what!

737
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:31,270
  Mr. Woo! Did you take your mother back home well?  

738
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,370
Yes. Why are you still awake?

739
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:37,370
I was about to go to bed.

740
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,350
I'm sorry to make you worry about me.

741
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,440
No, it's okay.

742
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:51,770
Mr. Woo, did you have a hard time today?

743
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:55,470
We can endure it together.

744
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,530
Everything will pass soon.

745
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,070
Yes, mother.

746
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:05,450
- I'll go upstairs.  
 - Yes, have some rest.

747
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,580
  Hwak Se, where are you?  

748
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:20,530
  Please, pick up your phone.  

749
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:46,320
♫   Did you forget? Did you forget about me?   ♫

750
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:51,850
♫   Did you forget all those memories   ♫

751
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:57,340

01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:20,680

756

I love you.

01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:55,620
♫   I'm still waiting for you   ♫

770
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:00,900
♫   My love is crying   ♫

771
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:06,470
♫   My heart is filled with tears   ♫

772
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:12,170
♫   Did you forget? Did you forget about me?   ♫

773
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:17,400
♫   I'm still waiting for you   ♫

774
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:23,070
♫   My love is crying   ♫

775
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:31,300
♫   My heart is filled with tears   ♫

776
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:36,940
♫   I'm trying to erase it again and again   ♫

777
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:42,710
♫   But I keep thinking of your face   ♫

778
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:48,390
♫   I'm trying to erase it again and again   ♫

779
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:55,850
♫   But I keep thinking of your face   ♫

780
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,930
     

781
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,650
  Is it deposited under the name Hwang Na Ro?  

782
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:04,390
  I guess Chairwoman Lee Choon Seok did it by putting Hwang Na Ro in the front.  

783
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:08,710
  How can you ask for help now? You should go back to America when I'm still talking nicely to you.  

784
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,670
  The company that interrupted is a subsidiary of the CEO Kim Jung Won?  

785
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,680
  Did Seo Ah really do it?  

786
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,960
  What does this mean?  

787
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:19,350
  It means that I love you.  

788
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:22,670
  I bet you're not feeling great since you're staying fall away from Jae Hee.  

789
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:24,270
  Oh...  

790
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:27,370
  Jae Hee, are you doing okay?  

791
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:31,470
  I'm very busy working hard.  

792
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:36,430
  I'm very busy that I can't even think about you.  

793
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,200
  I'm busy working, but...  

794
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,850
  I miss you every single second.  

795
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,720
  I miss you.
