1
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,140
Ma'am.

2
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,730
Please have a seat first.

3
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,120
There's a process to go 
through for the paternity test.

4
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,630
I'll explain it to you.

5
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,950
I have a favor to ask you.

6
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,980
 

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,680
These are the foods I wanted to 
make for you when I meet you.

8
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,960
I lost you when you were so little.

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,260
I didn't get to cook anything for you.

10
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,980
Here.

11
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,310
Here you go.

12
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,230
Take your time. Eat a lot.

13
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
Thank you for this food.

14
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,440
It's good.

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,680
- Really?
- Yes.

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,400
Eat slowly.

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,660
 

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,900
 

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,200
I'll get back now.

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,570
Thank you.

21
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,770
 

22
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,280
Hi. What's up, Mom?

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,850
Sorry, my daughter.

24
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,110
I kept calling you when
 you're busy, huh?

25
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,900
Are you at the office?

26
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,400
Yeah. Why?

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,790
That's great.

28
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm near your office.

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,510
If you didn't have lunch, I thought 
we could eat together.

30
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
Mom...

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,100
Didn't you go to work?

32
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,270
I thought you said 
you had to get back.

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,060
Oh...

34
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,440
Well...

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,300
About that... actually...

36
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,060
it was a lie.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,100
Could you take a look at this?

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,510
Oh, here?

39
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,230
 - This area?
- Yes. 

40
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,690
 Thank you. 

41
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,960
Yes. I wish you luck.

42
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,190
It's an opening. We'll give 
out lots of free stuff.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Thank you. I'll root for you.

44
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,320
Mom!

45
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,080
My daughter!

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,240
You should've rested at home on
 your day off. Why did you come?

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,270
Gosh. Wait.

48
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,690
Ta-da! Number two.

49
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,210
Right?

50
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,390
But Chae Woon, I...

51
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,930
actually bought this, too.

52
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,820
I thought you could wear this...

53
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,520
for a special occasion.

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,860
This was the last one in the store.

55
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,200
She said someone wanted it.

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,820
She said to bring it back
 if you don't like it.

57
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,750
- The salesperson said...
- And you believe that?

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,590
She said that to sell it to you.

59
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,300
No, she said it's true.

60
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,080
That she'd be in a bind.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,640
Let's see.

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,050
Wow!

63
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,530
It looks so lovely on you.

64
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,940
Gosh, it's so pretty.

65
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,650
Let's eat lunch. Let's go.

66
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,400
Do you like it?

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,130
Yeah. Let's go.

68
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,880
Did you work all this time
 without eating lunch?

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,610
Gosh, you'll hurt your stomach.

70
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,610
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

71
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,400
Gosh, dogani soup is expensive.

72
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,520
I was craving it.

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,860
Why?

74
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,560
Are you feeling weak these days?

75
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,070
No.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,210
Aigoo, it's enough.

77
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,830
You eat. Okay?

78
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,570
- Here, enjoy.
- My goodness...

79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,720
Just this much.

80
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,210
Mom.

81
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,350
I can't believe you're 
eating so late.

82
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,020
Hurry up and eat. Here.

83
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,430
Okay.

84
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,220
Put all the rice in and eat it.

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
 Eat slowly. 

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,720
 It's good. 

87
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,390
It's delicious.

88
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,000
It's good.

89
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,200
I said I'll get a taxi for you.

90
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,990
Aigoo, it's okay.

91
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,800
Gosh, it's so pretty.

92
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,630
Anyway, you always shine
 whatever you wear.

93
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,240
Why?

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
- Take a taxi.
- Aigoo...

95
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,840
Why bother? I can take a bus.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,450
Hey, the bus is coming.
 I'm leaving.

97
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,730
- Good day, my daughter!
- Mom! Mom!

98
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,120
Mom!

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,670
Mom...

100
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,490
Mom!

101
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,790
It will come quick.

102
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,690
Bye.

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,600
Okay.

104
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,400
Bye.

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,400
Hey, Bit Chae Woon...

106
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,540
You terrible b****.

107
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,370
 My Chae Woon lived a tough life. 

108
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,640
 I hope things turn out
 well this time. 

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,180
Oh, my.

110
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,490
Oh, my, that...

111
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,510
That woman...

112
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,260
 Isn't that right? 

113
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,520
 I know about your family very well. 

114
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,010
Gosh, that... that woman...

115
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,680
Driver, please stop!

116
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,310
I'll get off here. Please stop.

117
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,070
Wait, excuse me.

120
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,430
Ahjumma.

121
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,950
Ahjumma, you remember me, right?

122
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,450
- At the park last time...
- What?

123
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,360
- What...
- Wait.

124
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,950
You know me, right?

125
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,200
Who are you? How do 
you know me?

126
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,720
You're so weird. I've never 
seen you before.

127
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,730
- So weird...
- Ahjumma!

128
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,900
Gosh...

129
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,230
I'm sure it's her.

130
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,050
Aigoo...

131
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,480
Byun Mi Ja has last her touch.

132
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,980
You're sloppy and got caught.

133
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,460
What do you mean, get caught?

134
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,550
I completely denied it.

135
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,030
When I said, I've never 
seen her before,

136
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,800
she cowered right away.

137
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,730
Hey, Hyungnim is getting out soon.

138
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,270
We have to move quickly,

139
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,290
get some money and take off.

140
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,450
Do you think it's okay?

141
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,150
What if he finds out you 
changed your mind

142
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,630
and comes after you 
to take revenge?

143
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,440
He's not the old Park Pil Hong!

144
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,100
He's like a tiger without any claws.

145
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,100
What?

146
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,890
- Oh, my God!
- Hello.

147
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,160
Hey, you...

148
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,700
Hey, hey!

149
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,290
- Hey, hey...
- Where do you think you're going?

150
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,040
Geez, crazy bastard. Let go!

151
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,180
You're so rude!

152
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,230
You should quit it.

153
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,710
What?

154
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,270
What you're working on now.

155
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,340
The Samgwang Villa job.

156
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
How do you know that?

157
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,240
Did Pil Hong hyung tell you?

158
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,790
Why are you messing around and
 not do what you're told?

159
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,730
Pil Hong hyungnim looked 
extremely upset.

160
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,890
Pil Hong hyungnim knows?

161
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,430
I don't think he'll let you off easy.

162
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,160
What should I do?

163
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,890
S***...

164
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,530
In all things...

165
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,450
discernment and 
choices are crucial.

166
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Right?

167
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,680
Oh, really?

168
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,090
So, she talked to you last
 time as if she knew well.

169
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,180
But she denied it this time, 
saying she doesn't know you?

170
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,500
Yeah!

171
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,580
Wow, then when you 
talked to her at the park,

172
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,000
what did she say to you?

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,040
Well, just...

174
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,770
 They must've grown up so nicely... 

175
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,580
 despite the fact that one 
of them was stolen. 

176
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,490
Well, you know... a long time ago...

177
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,410
She said she worked at the
 same orphanage as me.

178
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,560
But it was an orphanage that
 I'm not familiar with.

179
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,180
I see.

180
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,590
Then we can have 
three hypotheticals.

181
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,100
First, she might be 
your hidden creditor.

182
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,790
She's not a creditor.

183
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,740
Chae Woon and I 
paid all that off.

184
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,420
Yeah, you did pay it off.

185
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,320
Then secondly.

186
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,030
A parent or an acquaintance
 looking for one among

187
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,600
Chae Woon, Ra Hoon, or Hae Deun?

188
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,960
Then why would she say I stole...

189
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,020
What?

190
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,230
Ah, no, Hwak Se.

191
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,620
How about thirdly?

192
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,340
Thirdly... thirdly...

193
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,260
Just a crazy woman.

194
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,390
Huh?

195
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,690
There are so many people
 like that these days.

196
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,030
They look perfectly fine
 on the outside.

197
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,600
But they'd approach you and...

198
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,800
they'd raise some questions

199
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,260
and scares you.

200
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,340
Then after that, she says, 
"You're shocked, huh?

201
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,060
It's a lie!" Then she takes off.

202
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,420
Gosh. Gosh, Hwak Se.

203
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,020
That's such a ridiculous example.

204
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,260
I know. So, it's nothing, Noonim.

205
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,590
Hearing that you 
adopted three kids,

206
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,590
there were so many 
people poking around.

207
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,120
She's just like one of them.

208
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,820
Don't worry, Noonim.

209
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,300
And who's by your side?

210
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,460
This Hwak Se is here, you know.

211
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,130
Oh, yeah!

212
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,930
I'll be late for my doctor.

213
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,240
A doctor? Why?

214
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,210
My throat. For my job.

215
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,670
Gosh...

216
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,860
My gosh.

217
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,090
Gosh, be careful, Hwak Se.

218
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,100
- Are you okay?
- My knee...

219
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,980
- I'm leaving.
- See you.

220
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
Aigoo...

221
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,220
Seriously.

222
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,390
Yes, sir. I'll send over the 
estimate right away.

223
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,800
Headbutt?

224
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,480
Koala.

225
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,820
What's going on?

226
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,320
We finished up all that.

227
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,630
Yes, I saw it. Everything looks good.

228
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,010
Since I worked on it,

229
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,980
I just wanted to check.

230
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,050
The second floor will 
be finished tomorrow.

231
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,220
Take a look. Good day.

232
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,550
Excuse me.

233
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,490
Did your head hurt yesterday?

234
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,430
Whoa, I guess you were fine.

235
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,090
As for me, my head 
has been throbbing

236
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,500
ever since you head-butted
 me mercilessly.

237
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,160
The stars in front of 
me won't disappear...

238
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,000
See? You're not doing well, either.

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
Is it the left side or right 
side of your head?

240
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,000
It's not your head?

241
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,870
Do you have a stomach 
ache? Let me see.

242
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,070
What are you doing?

243
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,780
Why is your tummy so hard?

244
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,830
What did you eat for lunch? 
Let me see.

245
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,780
What are you doing? Ticklish!

246
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,500
- Geez.
- That's weird.

247
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,530
You're sweating, too.

248
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,890
I overate!

249
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,660
Relax.

250
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,900
It's a bad indigestion.

251
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,190
Take some indigestion medicine.

252
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,890
And don't eat too much!

253
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,490
You should talk to the manager 
 about previously scheduled taping.

254
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,070
Yes. I'll transfer you to the 
management department.

255
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,540
Hae Deun.

256
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,770
- Take this to the studio.
- Okay.

257
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,640
 

258
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,440
They're already going
 on a world tour?

259
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,590
Hae Deun!

260
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,470
Hi, Sammie.

261
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,130
Why are you here?

262
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,020
You dropped out as 
a trainee a long time ago.

263
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,360
Oh, well...

264
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,220
She works for Slight.

265
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,860
Do you work in the office?

266
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
What in the world?

267
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,220
I like your new song. 
Nice choreography, too.

268
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,910
- I'll wish you big success.
- Us?

269
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,260
You shouldn't say that anymore.

270
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,970
Emerald is the company's 
signature group.

271
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,160
Thanks to us, you're 
getting your paycheck.

272
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,330
Oh, is that right? I had no idea.

273
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,920
Your name wasn't on 
my paycheck account.

274
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,350
What the heck? 
You're still an oddball.

275
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,650
Yeah, that's my charm. 
You know that.

276
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,420
Lee Hae Deun, 
you're regretting it, huh?

277
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,220
See? You should've
 done better then.

278
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,070
Only if you had warmed up to me,

279
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,260
you wouldn't have been 
cut from our team.

280
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,340
Your nasty temper. 
How problematic, huh?

281
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,980
Sammie.

282
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,880
What?

283
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,970
Your problem is that
 you're so consistent.

284
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,940
You can't sing, can't dance, so rude.

285
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,850
Most of all, so unattractive.

286
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,530
No wonder you got 
dumped by Ra Hoon.

287
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,950
Hey! Come over here. Hey!

288
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,280
Hey, hey, let it go!

289
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,190
- Let it go!
- Hey!

290
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,210
Hey! Stop!

291
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,860
 

292
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,850
Why did you quit so suddenly
 from Jeju Island Hospital?

293
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,500
It's personal.

294
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,450
So, what could that be...

295
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,500
I said it's personal.

296
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,410
Another rejection.

297
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,050
I feel like drinking.

298
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,100
Aunt.

299
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,330
Aunt...

300
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,780
Gosh.

301
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,800
Why are you here?

302
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,570
Wow, it's so good to see you.

303
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,480
As for me, I think my
 vocal cords are

304
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,810
strained due to too much singing.

305
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,680
I didn't ask and don't care.

306
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,150
Aunt.

307
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,850
Aunt!

308
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,590
Don't keep calling me that.

309
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,850
Other people might
 think I'm your aunt.

310
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,490
You're so weird.

311
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,180
Of course, I'd call you that 
since you're an aunt.

312
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,010
Gosh, she's strong
 enough to kill a cow.

313
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,400
Why is she at the hospital?

314
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,440
 

315
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,430
 

316
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,600
It looks like our competitors are 
showing tremendous growth.

317
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,820
President.

318
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,520
Please don't worry too much.

319
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,250
But our company is...

320
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,790
still on top of our industry.

321
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,800
Don't you know we should 
be more alert even so?

322
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,970
Mr. Jung Min Suk.

323
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,920
What do you think is the
 reason for their growth?

324
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,580
Well...

325
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,730
Based on my analysis,

326
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,460
there is a common factor
 for those companies.

327
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,430
They have either the heir to the 
company or young professionals

328
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,470
and are implementing aggressive
 business management.

329
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,910
So...

330
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,730
old people should step down?

331
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,960
Well, I wasn't speaking 
with you in mind, sir.

332
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,800
- The recent trend...
- Me?

333
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,990
Were you talking about me?

334
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,870
Well...

335
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,570
President is coming.

336
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,550
President is coming.

337
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,900
How dare that Jung Min Suk 
embarrasses me in public?

338
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,630
Mr. Seo, what do you think?

339
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,090
I don't think he was that bad...

340
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,750
Jung Min Suk...

341
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,660
He's trying to walk all over me.

342
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,290
Who's the one who
 brought him up this far?

343
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,380
I did that! Woo Jung Hoo!
 Isn't that right?

344
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,760
Yes, you're right.

345
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,700
Noona, what's wrong 
with Jung Hoo lately?

346
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,370
He blows his fuse over
 everything all the time

347
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,500
and is wrapped up in a victim
 mentality attacking me.

348
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,210
 - Is he going through midlife crisis? 
- Let him be.

349
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,120
His entire life is 
a midlife crisis hysteric,

350
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,820
and his entire body is

351
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,300
filled with a victim mentality.
 Don't you know?

352
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,920
Mom!

353
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,500
Jae Hee!

354
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,490
Jae Hee came over today, huh?

355
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
Aigoo...

356
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,030
Hello? Min Suk?

357
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,820
Is he busy?

358
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
- Uncle?
- Yeah.

359
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,930
Jae Hee!

360
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,030
My son...

361
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,060
How have you been?

362
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,600
As for me, I'm fine, of course.

363
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,990
You look darker.

364
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,530
Where?

365
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,380
I have lovely complexion 
since I take after you.

366
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,570
How is it that Ms. Jung Min Jae is 
getting prettier each day?

367
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,880
Aigoo, these guys
 will feel awkward.

368
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,810
Jae Hee...

369
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,840
Then take care.

370
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,370
Happy?

371
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,500
- Excuse me?
- In front of the executives,

372
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,440
you kicked around 
my son Jae Hee

373
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,460
and me both. Happy now?

374
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
When did I kick you around...

375
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,960
That's what you meant.

376
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,540
"The successful companies 
are doing well

377
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,970
thanks to successors who 
are obedient to their parents

378
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,660
learning the ropes in the business.

379
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,620
But Woo Jung Hoo, you couldn't 
even manage your only son

380
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,700
who lives out. What the heck 
are you doing, idiot?"

381
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,320
- That's what you meant.
- Idiot?

382
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,980
Geez, brother-in-law,

383
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,290
you tend to read

384
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,500
between the lines too 
broadly and too deeply.

385
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,390
That's what you were saying!

386
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,100
I'll change that.

387
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,710
How many years has it been?

388
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,670
My one and only precious son

389
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,510
is living out because 
of his father.

390
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,580
They say more 
precious your child,

391
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,630
you should let them 
experience the world.

392
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,970
Is that our situation?

393
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,480
How could he kick his 
own son out of the house?

394
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,820
I didn't get kicked out.

395
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,150
I walked out on my own.

396
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,050
I couldn't stand Father.

397
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,820
That's the same thing.

398
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,940
In the end, it's your 
father's fault.

399
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,100
Mom.

400
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,110
Please live and enjoy
 your life now.

401
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,690
What's this?

402
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,640
You live your life 
tiptoeing around Father.

403
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,180
Whenever I think of you,

404
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,230
yeah, yeah...

405
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,030
I can't swallow my food.

406
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,800
Don't you worry.

407
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,440
I'll take care of my life.

408
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,510
You say that all the time.

409
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,350
When?

410
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,490
Seriously.

411
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
- Geez.
- Is it good?

412
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,690
 
Father is calling. Wait.

413
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,950
 

414
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,220
He's in the meeting all the time.

415
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,090
 

416
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,690
Yes.

417
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,320
 Put Jae Hee on the phone. 

418
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
Yes?

419
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,830
He's right next to you. 
Put him on.

420
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,440
I'm watching you.

421
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,300
Honey...

422
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,680
don't be like this.

423
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,440
Why would the son
 you kicked out

424
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,910
be next to me?

425
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,140
What are you watching?

426
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,200
So, how is Jae Hee 
doing these days?

427
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,320
How would I know? You tell 
me not to contact him.

428
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,610
Yeah, right. You'd never.

429
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,870
Is there any rumor that

430
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,170
Jae Hee is struggling
 with business finances?

431
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,650
 Is he living long-term 

432
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,550
 in some cheap hotel? 

433
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,980
 That jerk. 

434
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,710
He should just lose everything.

435
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,710
 Aigoo. Aigoo! Seriously! 

436
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,970
Honey.

437
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,660
Did something upset you?

438
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,800
Don't get angry like that.

439
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,810
You have high blood pressure.

440
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,380
Geez!

441
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,700
 I'm sorry, but... 

442
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,430
 I don't think you're a fit for us. 

443
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,000
 You hear often that... 

444
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,930
 you have a strong 
personality, right? 

445
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,880
Who cares if I have 
a strong personality?

446
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,000
As long as I'm a good doctor.

447
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,760
Geez.

448
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,210
Hi, Hae Deun. What's up?

449
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,530
What's wrong with your voice?

450
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,170
Gosh, what a strange taste.

451
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,780
I don't like this stuff.
 I said, let's just go drink.

452
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,670
That's no fun. There
 should be dancing.

453
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,640
- Hi, Hae Deun.
- Hello.

454
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,840
- When is my uncle coming out?
- Probably soon.

455
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,220
Hello, everyone.

456
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,390
Taking the world by storm...

457
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,120
It's me, Kim Hwak Se.

458
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,590
Nice to meet you.

459
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Let's go!

460
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,160
♫  Did you see? Did you see? 
Did you see?  ♫

461
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,620
♫  Did you see me 
with another woman?  ♫
You're so cool! Uncle!

462
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,270
♫  Trust this man  ♫

463
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,590
♫  I said I'll love only you  ♫

464
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,160
♫  Did you see? Did you see? 
Did you see?  ♫

465
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,100
Does this draw people 
to the business?

466
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,000
You're so cool!

467
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,620
♫  Trust this man  ♫

468
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,400
Hwak Se!

469
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,900
Hae Deun!

470
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,060
Uncle, you're so cool.

471
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,780
Geez, my throat was
 scratchy today.

472
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,940
How did you like it, Aunt?

473
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,420
It was great. Very good. Great.

474
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,550
I keep bumping into you, Aunt.

475
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,980
I bumped into you
 at the hospital, too.

476
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,560
Huh? Why at the hospital?

477
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,800
I met a friend.

478
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,010
Hey, Mr. Jung, stop, stop.

479
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,750
- Come over here.
- Yes?

480
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,100
Hey, be especially generous with 
drinking food for our aunt.

481
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,860
Aunt, eat plenty. It's on me.

482
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,730
You're my hyungnim's aunt.

483
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,400
Hello, I'm Mr. Jung.

484
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,990
I'll bring it right out.

485
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,210
How am I your aunt?

486
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,730
Why do you keep calling
 me aunt? So annoying!

487
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,190
You're the one wearing a curtain!

488
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,950
Pardon?

489
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,960
Why am I your aunt? Why?

490
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,050
- Cheers!
- Why not call me mom?

491
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,770
I didn't call you mom, though.

492
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,300
Wang Sammie.

493
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,900
Lee Ra Hoon, are you serious?

494
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,530
Are you really dumping me?

495
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,750
Noona, it's not like 
I'm dumping you.

496
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,700
Since you're Hae Deun noona's
 friend, I'm a bit...

497
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,230
That's the same thing!

498
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,030
I bought you lots of good food,

499
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,380
and I was so nice to you. 
How can you reject me?

500
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,090
You'll regret this big time
 when I hit it big!

501
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,610
Lee Ra Hoon.

502
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,300
You'll regret this.

503
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,250
You'll regret this!

504
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,690
Wang Sammie isn't take it out on 
Hae Deun noona over that, right?

505
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,090
Geez, why couldn't 
Lee Hae Deun make it?

506
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,980
Poor Lee Hae Deun.

507
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,370
♫  Did you see? Did you see?  ♫
 Nice!

508
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,910
♫  Did you see?  ♫
 Hello.

509
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,570
♫  Did you see me with  ♫

510
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,930
♫  another woman?  ♫
 Sounds good!

511
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,800
Whoa! I didn't see it.

512
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,120
♫  Trust...  ♫

513
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,680
♫  Trust this man  ♫

514
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,180
Hae Deun. My Hae Deun...

515
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,680
- Are you feeling better?
- Much better.

516
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,000
Gosh, Hae Deun, 
you take after me.

517
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,910
You have such 
a cool personality.

518
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,520
Wang Sammie!

519
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,570
Wait until I find my parents. 
I won't let you off easy.

520
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,800
Hey.

521
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,870
Are you looking for
 your birth parents, too?

522
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,770
Why? Is someone looking
 for birth parents?

523
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,240
Lee Ra Hoon?

524
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,900
No, not Ra Hoon.

525
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,200
Auntie.

526
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,500
You can't tell my unni and mom.

527
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,370
They'll call me a traitor.

528
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,620
Even at the thought of
 looking for my birth parents.

529
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,890
I don't know about your mom

530
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,550
but probably not Bit Chae Woon.

531
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,170
Why not Chae Woon unni?

532
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,900
She's such a loyal woman.

533
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,580
Really? All right.

534
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,030
Why? Did something happen?

535
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,350
- No.
- Is that you, Hyo Jung?

536
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,110
It's not.

537
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,460
Gosh, she's late.

538
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,600
Ahjumma, are you 
waiting for someone?

539
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,800
Yes.

540
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,030
The young lady who lives here.

541
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,500
The young lady who lives here 
must be either Unni or me.

542
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,190
Are you a young lady, too?

543
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,850
Were you waiting for me?

544
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,720
Hyo Jung!

545
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,510
What brings you here...

546
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,050
Unni, why are you Hyo Jung?

547
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,040
She's not Hyo Jung. 
She's Bit Chae Woon.

548
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,390
Did she come to 
our house already?

549
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,930
Did the test result come 
out already, ahjumma?

550
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,000
It's not like that.

551
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,650
Unni!

552
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,670
Mom! Mom!

553
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,400
Why is a handcart here?

554
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,700
What are you guys 
doing over there?

555
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,330
We stopped by Uncle Hwak Se's
 workplace tonight.

556
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,390
Why did you go there?

557
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,020
I'll throw that out.

558
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,430
Gosh, what brought that on? 
Such a princess.

559
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,390
Unni, do you have
 any food at home?

560
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,810
Do you have something soupy?

561
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,000
- Some soup?
- Let's go!

562
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,470
- Let's go!
- What's wrong with you?

563
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,880
I'm hungry.

564
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,200
Is there soup?

565
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,490
Gosh, what's with you?

566
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,390
Go in. Give me something to eat.

567
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,090
Hyo Jung, wait.

568
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,700
I'm not Hyo Jung.

569
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,640
It's uncomfortable to 
face my family.

571
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,180
I'm sorry.

572
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,640
I was so curious to 
see how you were living.

573
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,310
I do understand...

574
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,450
how you feel, but...

575
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,790
seeing you before the DNA test
 results come out is too...

576
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,170
I feel so bad for my mom.

577
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,810
Yeah.

578
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,020
 I believed... 

579
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,640
 I wouldn't need a DNA test. 

580
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,040
 Hyo Jung! 

581
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,000
 Oh, my gosh! 

582
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,960
 The moment I saw her, 

583
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,660
 I felt that she wasn't 
my birth mom. 

584
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,310
 I wonder if she felt that, too. 

585
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,250
Be careful going home.

586
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,430
I got it.

587
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,840
Chae Woon!

588
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,400
- Coming home now?
- Mom.

589
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,740
Why are you out here?

590
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,820
Just because. 
The night air felt nice.

591
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,680
I got to kill two birds 
with one stone.

592
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,570
I got to feel the night air,

593
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,090
and I got to greet my daughter.

594
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,400
It's cold.

595
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,010
Gosh, it's okay.

596
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,910
Let's go in. You worked hard.

597
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,380
When you get out, 
find Lee Soon Jung.

598
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,880
She knows where 
my daughter is.

599
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,070
She could be living with her.

600
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,960
I must find my daughter.

601
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,010
She's the bundle of money.

602
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,390
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

603
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,700
So...

604
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,520
Is that why you called 
me into your room?

605
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,330
To ask me about that?

606
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,440
Yeah.

607
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,360
How could you be looking for your
 birth parents behind our backs?

608
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,070
Lower your voice.

609
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,700
Mom will hear you.

610
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,970
How could you do that?

611
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,570
Didn't you look for yours?

612
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,150
You always said your parents 
must be super-rich.

613
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,610
I only said so.

614
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,680
I didn't carry it into action.

615
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,850
Same difference!

616
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,330
This is why I say you're scary.

617
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,350
What?

618
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,800
I'm home.

619
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,440
Hi, Ra Hoon. You're home.

620
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,130
Aigoo, it must've been tough
 studying hard until late.

621
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,230
- Yeah.
- Aigoo.

622
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,600
What's this?

623
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,270
Gosh, your feet stink.

624
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,780
Your feet never stank.

625
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,940
Huh?

626
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,220
Maybe because I played foot 
volleyball with my friends after lunch?

627
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,670
Aigoo, it's not like you're 
still in high school.

628
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,920
- Go and wash up.
- Okay.

629
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,810
Hey.

630
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,620
But still...

631
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,300
Even if you played foot volleyball...

632
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Hey, Ra Hoon.

633
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,680
Are you feeling sick?

634
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,710
Should we go to the hospital?

635
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,840
No. Your son is so healthy.

636
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,050
- Feel it.
 - Lee Hae Deun! 

637
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,090
What's that?

638
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,490
Gosh. Are they fighting?

639
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,860
Unni...

640
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,850
I have something serious
 to discuss with you.

641
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,910
Man Jung, wait.

642
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,030
Unni. Unni!

643
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Unni, the upstairs room. 
The empty room.

644
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,710
Can I use it until 
you get a tenant?

645
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,100
What? Aren't you going
 back to Jeju Island?

646
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,250
Yeah, that? Come here. Come.

647
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,750
A traitor?

648
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,140
That's right! A traitor!

649
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,760
Are you fighting?

650
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,510
- You can hear us?
- Yeah.

651
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,640
How am I a traitor?

652
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,260
Meeting my unworthy 
birth parents

653
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,510
might lead me to 
nothing but crap.

654
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,730
I'm prepared for that. 
What traitor?

655
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,460
Then why are you looking
 for your birth parents?

656
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,980
Keep it down.

657
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,630
Why did you look for them?

658
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,240
If you aren't trying to abandon us, 
why did you look for them?

659
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,840
- Geez!
- Hey!

660
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,360
Why is hospital construction 
taking so long?

661
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,380
By chance, is there a problem 
between you and Dr. Song?

662
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,700
- No, it's not that.
 - Hey! 

663
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,220
- Unni.
- Those guys...

664
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,500
- Unni!
- Gosh.

665
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,990
- Let me go.
- Unni.

666
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,430
Listen to me! Let me 
use the upstairs room!

667
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,460
Noonas, stop it!

668
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,580
Come on! Stop it!

669
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,590
Why did I look for 
my birth parents?

670
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,690
Why did I look for them?

671
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,400
I wanted to see their faces.

672
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,770
What kind of morons are they that

673
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,950
they abandoned their own child?

674
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,450
Exactly what do they look like?

675
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,730
I wanted to see their faces.

676
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,530
I just wanted to...

677
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,040
see their faces!

678
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,960
- Noona.
 - Unni, let's talk! 

679
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,420
Hurry, go in.

680
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,320
Hurry up and go!

681
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,600
What the heck?

682
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,850
Who's fighting?

683
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,370
Gosh, seriously.

684
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,420
♫  So annoying...  ♫

685
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,760
Hey.

686
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,720
Where are Chae Woon 
and Hae Deun?

687
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,130
Noonas?

688
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,700
They were chatting it up. 
Are they sleeping now?

689
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,120
Geez. Bit Chae Woon.
 Lee Hae Deun!

690
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,040
Are you guys fighting?

691
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,500
Hurry up and come down. Hurry.

692
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,430
Hi, Mom. Why?

693
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,320
- Where is Chae Woon?
- Unni?

694
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,350
She's sleeping.

695
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,050
She always falls asleep 
with a mask on.

696
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,820
Gosh, the kids...

697
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,710
seem to be having fun. 
They're in a good mood.

698
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,360
Why do you keep 
saying they're fighting?

699
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,620
Unni, are you hearing things?
 Should I take a look?

700
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,680
Please get along.

701
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,140
What did I tell you
 I hate the most?

702
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,100
 Us fighting. 

703
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,250
Gosh, seriously.

704
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,490
Put blanket over Chae Woon.

705
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,550
Okay.

706
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,380
Did you wash your feet?

707
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,650
Not yet.

708
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,200
Hurry up and wash up.

709
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,350
I was wondering who was
 making chunggukjang.

710
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,780
It was you?

711
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,030
- You mean this?
- Come on!

712
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,410
Not again!

713
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Unni.

714
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,050
Then I'll use the upstairs room.

715
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,390
- Until you find a tenant.
- My gosh.

716
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,490
Unni, why do you 
keep ignoring me?

717
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,460
Unni.

718
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,470
Unni.

719
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,080
Why do you keep thinking

720
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,200
that your birth parents
 abandoned you?

721
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,180
Well, they could've 
had a good reason.

722
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,290
Or maybe you were kidnapped.

723
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,430
If I got kidnapped,
 how could Mom raise me?

724
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,820
Well...

725
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,760
You were kidnapped
 and escaped.

726
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,510
Then someone took you
 to an orphanage?

727
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,130
I'm sure you were so tough 
even as a baby that

728
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,500
you got the upper hand with adults.

729
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,920
You probably could've 
escaped from evil people.

730
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,470
Are you sleeping?

731
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,320
Gosh, seriously.

732
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,270
My goodness...

733
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,850
I wonder where my parents are.

734
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,300
I'm sure they didn't abandon me.

735
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,810
They couldn't have.

736
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,530
Gosh, whatever.

737
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,650
Are you done fighting now?

738
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,950
- Go now.
- Huh?

739
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,710
That's my spot.

740
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,290
Move.

741
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,420
I don't want to.

742
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,540
Ow.

743
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,010
Sorry, Noona.

744
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,500
That's my spot.

745
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
You can come here.

746
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,200
Yeah, go over there.

747
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,430
I want to snuggle
 next to you, too.

748
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,650
This reminds me of the old days.

749
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,080
Right, Noona?

750
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,000
You're spitting on me.

751
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,670
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon,
 did you wash your feet?

752
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,100
I washed a 100 times.

753
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,500
Hey!

754
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,220
Geez.

755
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,990
Get over there, Lee Hae Deun.

756
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,000
You're too heavy.

757
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,470
I don't want to. I'm scared.

758
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,480
Then turn my direction.

759
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,890
No, you have to be 
behind my back.

760
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,370
So that you can protect me.

761
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,150
There are no eyes on my back.

762
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,840
Me, too. Me, too.

763
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,920
Geez...

764
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,950
 I couldn't escape 
because of you guys. 

765
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,740
 Because of you guys. 

766
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,740
 Actually, it wasn't you guys. 

767
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,520
 It was because of Mom. 

768
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,100
 No. Because of me. 

769
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,600
 My Chae Woon... 

770
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,260
 must've been heartbroken again. 

771
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,710
 This time... 

772
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,730
 I'm sure she was hoping... 

773
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,380
 she'd find her birth mom. 

774
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,240
Are you looking for someone?

775
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,700
Ms. Jung Won...

776
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,250
What do I do?

777
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,170
I...

778
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,510
I really wronged you, 
Ms. Jung Won.

779
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,000
Gosh, so cute.
 

780
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,460
 

781
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,600
So adorable.

782
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,040
Adorable...

783
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
Seo Yeon...

784
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,470
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫

785
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,100
♫  Why do I feel sad 
out of the blue?  ♫

786
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,680
Ma'am.

787
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,000
You have a delivery.

788
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,770
 This is our new season item. 

789
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,990
 My friend. 

790
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,390
 Stay stylish even at home. 

791
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,680
 Jung Won. 

792
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,040
"Jung Won."

793
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,760
Are you a highschooler?

794
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,270
It's so pretty.

795
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,510
Your friend sent it to you, right?

796
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,200
The LX Group CEO.

797
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,060
Gosh, you're so lucky.

798
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,390
I'll go to the mart.

799
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,600
Okay.

800
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,750
"Stay stylish even at home."

801
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,580
Is she saying I look 
pathetic since I stay home?

802
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,480
Even when she speaks,

803
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,800
she sure has a way 
of offending you.

804
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,040
 

805
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,110
 Aigoo, aigoo... 

806
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,140
 She always goes around 
with her minions. 

807
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,350
Jung Won!

808
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,040
Hi, Min Jae!

809
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,200
How have you been?

810
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,630
I made a few side dishes for you.

811
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,730
I'm always receiving expensive 
clothes from you. I felt bad.

812
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,730
Gosh, you didn't have to.

813
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,450
Thanks, I'll enjoy it.

814
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,630
But why didn't you wear 
the clothes I sent you?

815
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,960
Well...

816
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,360
Jung Won.

817
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,630
I'm so grateful that you send me 
beautiful clothes for me.

818
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,300
But I wish you'd stop doing that.

819
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,250
I came to tell you that, actually.

820
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,540
Why?

821
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,050
Do you feel burdened?

822
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,470
Gosh, we're friends.

823
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,960
Well, rather than that...

824
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,370
I don't think they're my style.

825
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,030
You're a professional
 in the fashion industry.

826
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,670
But I do have my own style.

827
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,790
Having high quality and 
beautiful clothes collect dust

828
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,480
makes me feel bad.

829
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,250
Is that right?

830
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,340
You should've told me sooner.

831
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,880
How can I?

832
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,440
When my friend enjoys 
doing that for me?

833
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,350
And...

834
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,640
giving gifts and showing favor...

835
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,910
Isn't it all for self-satisfaction?

836
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,780
Comforting oneself, 
thinking "I've been generous."

837
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,920
Aren't you cautious 
because of your husband?

838
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,350
Min Jae.

839
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,220
You know, I wish you'd be 
more confident at home.

840
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,610
Dress in nice clothes and stuff.

841
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,670
Hey!

842
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,600
I do dress in nice clothes.

843
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Your clothes aren't the 
only nice clothes out there.

844
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,380
Why won't you 
acknowledge my style?

845
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,750
Girl, why are you laughing?

846
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,700
I got it.

847
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,900
I appreciate your style.

848
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,910
Happy now?

849
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,000
I won't send you clothes 
again in the future.

850
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,420
Thanks for understanding.

851
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,460
But what's this?

852
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,560
That?

853
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,490
They're organic vegetables
 directly from the farm.

854
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,000
I seasoned them 
with fresh perilla oil.

855
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,540
- It's very good.
- Gosh, you worked so hard.

856
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,130
I'll enjoy them...

857
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,650
although it's not my food style.

858
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,270
- See you again.
- Sure.

859
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,330
- Bye.
- Bye.

860
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,800
That girl...

861
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,800
She doesn't give me an inch.

862
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,930
I shouldn't have come.

863
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,210
Really?

864
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,910
Yes. Thank you.

865
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,370
Scared me.

866
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,880
What's wrong?

867
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,240
Did you overeat again?

868
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,830
What do we do about
 your huge appetite?

869
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,210
Relax.

870
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,900
Wait, wait, wait. 
What's wrong? What?

871
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,890
What's wrong?

872
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:03,520
- I got it.
- What?

873
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,950
The grand prize.

874
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,380
The design competition.

875
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,980
I got the grand prize.

876
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,910
Really? Wow! Congratulations!

877
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,230
Congratulations!

878
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,690
Everyone, Ms. Lee 
won a competition!

879
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,490
She got the grand prize. 
Applause!

880
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,700
Congrats!

881
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,840
♫  Congratulations  ♫

882
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,110
♫  Congratulations  ♫

883
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,400
If it's the grand prize...

884
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,700
Oh, my.

885
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,840
The winner?

886
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,220
Really?

887
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,420
Yeah, Mom.

888
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,740
Yeah.

889
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:44,440
I just got the call.

890
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,660
Oh, my. Chae Woon, then...

891
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,430
are you going to the 
States to study?

892
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,530
Yeah.

893
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,460
Oh, my gosh!

894
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,470
Ahjumma, what's wrong?

895
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,170
She won!

896
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,390
My Chae Woon won, ma'am!

897
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,330
She won!

898
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,980
Ahjumma!

899
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,700
Really?

900
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,340
Daebak! Daebak!

901
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,820
Wow!

902
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,930
Yay!

903
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,930
Are you serious?

904
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,340
Noona, you're the best!

905
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,360
The best, best, best! Yay!

906
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,160
 Cheers! 

907
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,980
- Congrats!
- Congratulations.

908
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,300
I can't believe this day is here.

909
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,600
After you dropped out
 from the finals

910
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,000
we all had to walk
 on eggshells for days.

911
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,480
That's right.

912
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,340
Walk on eggshells?

913
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,010
No one even cared.

914
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:42,000
Hey, do you think it's easy 
to pretend not to care?

915
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
They were being considerate.

916
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,170
- You brat.
- Yup.

917
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:46,580
You're at it again.

918
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,250
Hurry up and eat the meat 
before it gets cold.

919
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,520
- Such a brat.
- All right.

920
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,200
At this point, Noonim...

921
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,260
Say a word. Well...

922
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,800
Congratulatory comments or...

923
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,640
congratulatory something...

924
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,990
Aigoo, what did I do...

925
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,100
Everyone, eat.

926
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,800
My gosh.

927
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,440
Gosh, good job, my daughter.

928
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,080
Thanks, Mom.

929
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,030
I thank you. Thanks.

930
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,320
Nice.

931
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,460
Thank you, everyone.

932
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,160
For putting up with 
my nasty temper.

933
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,910
- And for taking it.
- So, you know.

934
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:27,290
When Unni goes overseas, 
that means I can visit New York!

935
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,590
Me, too.

936
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,320
Taking care of herself is enough.

937
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,770
Why would you go there, too?

938
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:32,530
Yeah, Lee Hae Deun.

939
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,750
- Control yourself.
- Geez.

940
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,090
You'll have a room, Unni.

941
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,450
- I can sleep on the floor.
- That's right.

942
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,860
- I can eat a hamburger once a day.
- Yeah.

943
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,880
Who knows?

944
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,710
I might seduce a New Yorker.

945
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,900
That's possible.

946
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,800
Hey, I'm sure the men 
there have eyes.

947
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,760
Uncle.

948
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,280
- What do you mean by that?
- Mind your business.

949
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,580
Mind your business.

950
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,990
Mind your business.

951
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,540
That's right.

952
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,090
- What about me?
- So sad...

953
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,690
Do you know English? 
Do you know?

954
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,600
Speak to me...

955
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,210
in English, please.

956
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:12,190
Chae Woon won the competition!

957
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,080
Boom clap, boom clap, 
thump, thump.

958
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:24,500
 

959
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,980
Geez.

960
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,030
Hey, don't put too much.

961
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,390
Don't worry. Too much makeup 
doesn't look good on you.

962
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,740
Lift your chin.

963
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,080
Like this. Lift.

964
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,060
Unni, your complexion
 looks so bad.

965
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,190
You should take care. 
You're a woman.

966
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,400
- You want to die?
- Hot!

967
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,280
- Hey!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

968
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,910
Are you burning all 
my hair, Ra Hoon?

969
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,890
No, I'm trying to 
make you look good.

970
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,240
- Do this.
- Then, I can't put makeup on.

971
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,450
- Why are you getting mad?
- Move it.

972
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,500
You just did that.

973
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,770
My gosh.

974
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,280
Are you ready?

975
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,860
Chae Woon.

976
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,450
I ironed this.

977
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,570
It's pretty. You only buy for Unni.

978
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,150
Aigoo, I'll buy one for 
you, too, Hae Deun.

979
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,910
- Aigoo.
- It's pretty.

980
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,600
Aigoo, Chae Woon is so pretty.

981
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,160
 

982
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,010
My goodness.

983
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,680
Today is an important 
day for Chae Woon.

984
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,040
I borrowed it from 
a friend of mine.

985
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,090
A bow?

986
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,800
Is someone getting married?

987
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,020
Uncle...

988
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,520
This is too much.

989
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,490
Why? I like it.

990
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,910
It's pretty, Hwak Se.

991
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,650
Yeah, this is just wrong, Uncle.

992
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,990
This is too much.

993
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,030
- What's this?
- Come on.

994
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,180
Too much what?

995
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,660
Too much. Over the top. 
Excessive.

996
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,170
Then...

997
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,210
Then I can take them off.

998
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,640
My gosh.

999
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,940
Just this one. 
I'll take this one off.

1000
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,110
What are you doing? 
Move it, move it.

1001
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,850
- How do I ride in this?
- Go.

1002
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,240
Bye! Gosh, too tacky.

1003
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,300
- Mom.
- Mom...

1004
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,660
Why are you crying again?

1005
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,060
Gosh, Soon Jung. I was wondering
 why you weren't crying yet.

1006
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,090
You held it in. Pretty good.

1007
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,400
Go in, Unni.

1008
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,420
- Let's go in.
- Okay, let's go.

1009
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,350
Aigoo, Unni...

1010
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,950
- Don't cry.
- My unni.

1011
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,140
 

1012
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,900
Aigoo, my Chae Woon...

1013
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,710
You fulfilled your dream.

1014
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,950
I'm so proud of you, daughter.

1015
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,940
- Unni.
- Why?

1016
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,460
Then I'll use the upstairs 
room. I'll clean it.

1017
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,360
Just share my room.

1018
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,480
What if the guy 
upstairs comes back?

1019
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,910
Sharing your room is 
so uncomfortable for me.

1020
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,960
And that guy will never come back.

1021
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,190
He's behind three months in rent.

1022
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,720
This isn't the first time. 
I'm cleaning up.

1023
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,000
Hey, hey, Man Jung!

1024
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,500
- Hey, Man Jung!
- Don't follow me.

1025
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,830
Gosh!

1026
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,000
How was your
 business trip to Milan?

1027
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,520
It was all right.

1028
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,160
Let's talk during the meeting.

1029
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,720
What's on my schedule today?

1030
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,140
There's the design competition 
award ceremony this morning.

1031
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,560
Here is the winners' list.

1032
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,670
After the ceremony,

1033
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,000
you'll chat with the winners.
 

1034
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:31,130
CEO can't make it due to her schedule.
 

1035
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,880
 

1036
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,690
Bit Chae Woon...

1037
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,900
Lee Bit Chae Woon?

1038
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,340
It's a unique name, huh?

1039
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,860
 I'm sorry. 

1040
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,340
 That's why... 

1041
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,180
When I reviewed last time,

1042
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,350
I didn't see this name.

1043
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,650
You didn't see it since that
 was a blind screening.

1044
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:08,690
 

1045
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,550
 

1046
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,630
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

1047
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,400
Yes.

1048
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,400
Revoke my prize?

1049
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,510
One of the judges

1050
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,470
suspected plagiarism.

1051
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,450
My apologies.

1052
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,840
We should've scrutinized more.

1053
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,950
I didn't plagiarize.

1054
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,860
Please let me meet the judge
 who voiced suspicion.

1055
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,760
I'll explain.

1056
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,400
I can't reveal the judge.

1057
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,100
However, the judge 
who voiced suspicion

1058
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,870
did provide compelling evidence

1059
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,860
and other judges agreed as well.

1060
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,140
That's why we decided
 to revoke your win.

1061
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,250
 

1062
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,060
 

1063
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:35,230
 

1064
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,930
The grand prize goes
 to Kim Dae Won.

1065
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,330
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1066
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,100
 

1067
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,700
 Plagiarism. 

1068
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,100
 Nonsense. 

1069
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,550
 What do I need to do? 

1070
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,000
 What do I do? 

1071
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,350
 To reveal that I didn't plagiarize... 

1072
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,540
 To reveal that I didn't do it... 

1073
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,750
I can't see. I can't.

1074
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,960
I can't see.

1075
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,680
Hey! Why are you here?

1076
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,100
It was here.

1077
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,510
It was here.

1078
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,500
Hey!

1079
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,920
What's wrong with you?

1080
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,230
Auntie, well...

1081
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,480
Did you see the stuff 
that was here?

1082
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,270
The books and a sketchbook...

1083
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,890
Wasn't that trash?

1084
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,020
I gave that to the waste 
paper recycling man.

1085
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,470
I saw them while 
cleaning upstairs.

1086
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,620
You can't throw that away!

1087
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,400
- I can't?
- When?

1088
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,590
- Oh, no! 
- What time?

1089
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,970
What time?

1090
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,500
Taxi! Taxi!

1091
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,640
Taxi.

1092
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,150
 If I prove that I've thought 
of the idea as a child, 

1093
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,820
 I can clear my name. 

1094
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,860
 I'll prove it for sure. 

1095
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,200
Where are the scraps
 you collected today?

1096
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,300
Scraps? Over there.

1097
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,680
Thank you.

1098
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,890
 I'll find it. 

1099
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,460
 I'll find it. 

1100
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,230
I found it!

1101
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:29,760
I found it!

1102
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,240
I found it!

1103
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,010
I'm so glad...

1104
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,320
The design department
 has a workshop today.

1105
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,870
Everyone left for another
 province an hour ago.

1106
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:05,290
Where is the location 
of the workshop?

1107
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,940
I can't tell you that.

1108
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,550
Please tell me.

1109
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:12,840
I have to clear something up.

1110
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,420
Please come back on Monday.

1111
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,720
No...

1112
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,980
Then...

1113
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,810
please give me the number to
 the competition coordinator.

1114
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,790
I'm sorry.

1115
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,420
Wait...

1116
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,510
I'm not trying to pull 
anything weird.

1117
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,380
This. I just have to 
give this to her.

1118
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,770
You can't do this here.

1119
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,500
- Please get out.
- Wait...

1120
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,100
- Just once, please.
- Young lady.

1121
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:33,840
Let's go.

1122
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,990
I have to clear it soon.

1123
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,480
I can't let too much time pass.

1124
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,630
 

1125
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,000
- CEO, you're getting wet.
- It's okay.

1126
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,130
 LX Fashion CEO? 

1127
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,960
I was going to have a cozy 
dinner with my baby tonight.

1128
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,340
You only think of Jae Hee, huh?

1129
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,930
After you returned from
 your business trip,

1130
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,960
you haven't even seen me yet.

1131
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

1132
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,200
I'll be home right after dinner.

1133
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,190
Yeah.

1134
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,950
I love you, Mom.

1135
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,900
Father!

1136
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,130
Seo Ah.

1137
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,200
Have you been well?

1138
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,610
Yeah.

1139
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,480
Why is it raining so much?

1140
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,650
Excuse me!

1141
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,300
Hello, CEO.

1142
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,500
- Hi. Is everything good?
- Yes.

1143
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,730
Yes?

1144
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:48,970
 I'm Lee Bit Chae Woon. 

1145
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:52,380
 Please let me meet the CEO. 

1146
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,350
What's going on?

1147
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:56,840
Yes. She wants to meet you.

1148
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,790
I'll let her go.

1149
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:01,440
The CEO isn't home.

1150
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,280
If you continue, I'll call security.

1151
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,080
 I got my design competition 

1152
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,150
 win revoked. 

1153
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,450
 I... 

1154
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,770
 I've been falsely 
accused of plagiarism. 

1155
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,720
 I'm here to explain myself. 

1156
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,210
 This right here. 

1157
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:30,140
 I bought my proof as well. 

1158
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,700
 Please let me meet 
the CEO just once. 

1159
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,820
 I just saw her go in. 

1160
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,530
- Look at her...
- Wait a minute.

1161
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,780
Hello.

1162
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,230
What is this about?

1163
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,800
Well...

1164
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,130
I'm sorry to visit you 
out of the blue.

1165
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,140
I...

1166
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,540
Your win got revoked 
because of plagiarism?

1167
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,740
Yes.

1168
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,590
I never got a brief about that.

1169
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,500
It got revoked.

1170
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,270
But I never plagiarized. So...

1171
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,200
I brought the proof since
 I felt that it wasn't fair.

1172
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,500
The proof...

1173
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:27,290
- The proof...
- My gosh!

1174
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,000
Miss!

1175
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,300
Look.

1176
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,720
Miss.

1177
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,930
Mom...

1178
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,900
Peek-a-boo!

1179
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,630
My Seo Yeon.

1180
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:09,030
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1181
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:11,690
Miss!

1182
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:16,870
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1183
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:23,490
♫  You're drawn to each 
other like the magnets  ♫

1184
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:32,800
♫  I can fill the hole that 
was dug in my heart  ♫

1185
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:43,930
♫  When I see you, I smile  ♫

1186
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:51,770
♫  You became my refuge
 when I struggled  ♫

1187
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:54,000
 

1188
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,890
 Never mind ahjumma. You quit. 

1189
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:59,040
 - Mom, what are you doing here?
- What do I do? 

1190
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,720
 This is Lee Hae Deun's workplace. 
What should I do? 

1191
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,220
 Ahjussi! 

1192
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,750
 Why didn't you report to me? 

1193
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,690
  
- Do you know her?
- It's her, Mom. 

1194
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:10,060
 The girl who bullied me in middle 
school and quit school. 

1195
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,450
 Ms. Jo! 

1196
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:15,480
 There is something
 I must show you. 

1197
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,730
 Even if it takes time, 

1198
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,410
 I want to prove that I'm innocent. 

1199
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:22,000
♫  That's you  ♫
