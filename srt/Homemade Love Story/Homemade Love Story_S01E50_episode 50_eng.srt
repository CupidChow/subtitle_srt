1
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,550
Jae Hee.

2
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,870
Come here. Come over here.

3
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,910
Come here. You can hear them from here.

4
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,130
- You could hear them?
- Yeah.

5
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,440
A chance?

6
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,830
Yes.

7
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,330
 
You asked me for a chance last time.

8
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,600
A chance for you to show me 
how you've changed.

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,630
I'm here to give you that chance.

10
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,450
What kind of chance...

11
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,670
are you giving me coming
 over with a suitcase?

12
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,720
Coming over to pick me up
 in the morning,

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,530
coming to the store during lunch,

14
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,040
and taking care of me.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,240
These are some things
 you've never done before.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,140
But I don't think...

17
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,220
I could determine if you've truly
 changed only with those things.

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,770
You think it's just on the surface?

19
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,230
Yup. More so...

20
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,530
to see how much you've 
changed in everyday life.

21
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,330
To see if you've truly changed
 to Woo Jung Hoo 2.

22
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,390
I decided to live with you 
to experience you

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,440
for myself and decide.

24
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,050
Then...

25
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,990
you haven't accepted 
my heart for you yet, right?

26
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,470
Of course not.

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,810
I'll stay in a separate room. 
I'll pay you rent, too.

28
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,630
It took a lot of thinking

29
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,780
for me to declare my independence
 when I left this house.

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,220
I want to think it through seriously 
to determine if I should come back.

31
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,730
Jung Min Jae, you really 
did think about this a lot.

32
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,230
Great. Let's do that.

33
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,980
You guys heard that, right?

34
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,220
Yes, Dad.

35
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,590
Jae Hee.

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,750
Take Jung Min Jae 
to the room she'll stay in.

37
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,850
Gosh, why bother?
 I know which room I'm using.

38
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,020
Mom. Are you really back, Mom?

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,430
Yeah.

40
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,300
Mom...

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,150
Hello, CEO.

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,800
Thank you for your work.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,920
I'm sorry, but this way, please.

44
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,470
This is where you guys came to 
after leaving your home?

45
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,510
We left our cellphones and our wallets.

46
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,190
How did you get in here?

47
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,430
I know the security guard pretty well.

48
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,850
He let me in.

49
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,290
My gosh.

50
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,960
The security team has
 a lot of problems here.

51
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,870
What did you do that the 
fire alarm went off?

52
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,700
By chance, did you two 
have a party here?

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,580
Hey.

54
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,320
Stop butting in.

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,480
Mom, well...

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,660
we weren't having a party.

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,820
It's actually our first night together...

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,210
What?

59
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,490
First what?

60
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,580
Our first night together, girl.

61
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,050
Mom!

62
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,210
I'll tell you all about it when we get home.

63
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,020
I mean, did you feel like celebrating 
after leaving like that?

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,630
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,870
We were so busy
 cross-marking our moms

66
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,120
that we didn't get to see
 each other much.

67
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,720
We were happy to be together 
first time in a while.

68
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,340
Hey.

69
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,290
Change your clothes. 
You'll catch a cold.

70
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

71
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,040
Let's go.

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,380
What should we wear?

73
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,960
They're blocking the door.

74
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,620
- We can't leave.
- Should I wear that?

75
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,200
You talk too much!

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,840
Gosh, it's cold.

77
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,100
Hae Deun, are you catching a cold?

78
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,850
I know...

79
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,120
You have to watch out.

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,830
- Mr. Makjang.
- My gosh! Scared me!

81
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,560
What?

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,370
Gosh, nothing to show for. 
Why the fuss?

83
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,320
What I mean is...

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,280
Don't you think our situation
 just got more serious?

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,320
What if they lock us up in our rooms
 and forbid us to leave?

86
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,040
Nah...

87
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,920
What if they really do that?

88
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,920
The way I see it, I think it's time 
to use our last card.

89
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,300
- Last card?
- Yeah, our last card.

90
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,420
I see. Makcard. 
(short for "the last card.")

91
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,670
- Okay.
- Why don't you ask me what it is?

92
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,280
- What is it?
- See? You don't know.

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,090
- What is it?
- Why didn't you ask me?

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,480
- Are you all changed?
- Come out if you're dressed.

95
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,400
Mother, I'm sorry for having 
you come all the way here.

96
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,300
I came to get Hae Deun.

97
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,870
Oh, my goodness...

98
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,050
I mean...

99
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,010
what were you doing
 that the fire alarm went off?

100
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,390
This could've been in the news.

101
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,180
I'm so embarrassed to
 face the security team.

102
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,490
Sit down, you guys.
 Why are you standing?

103
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,720
Sit down.

104
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,190
Mom.

105
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,980
Mother, well...

106
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,350
we discussed everything 
after we left the house.

107
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,450
We have our decision.

108
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,810
To do what?

109
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,200
- Well, we...
- We'll...

110
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,220
go our separate ways.

111
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,860
 What did you say? 

112
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,080
Due to our momentary bravado,

113
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,550
we made immature decisions.
 We apologize.

114
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,600
We'll start our divorce procedure
 right away tomorrow.

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,970
My gosh, look at them...

116
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,410
Hey.

117
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,940
Do you think marriage is a joke?

118
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,990
If you were going to do this,

119
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,170
why did you play 
with fire in the office?

120
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,480
You said you were celebrating
 getting your marriage license.

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,920
Actually, that was our farewell ceremony.

122
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,520
I guess our love was like
 playing with fire.

123
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,060
We behaved in such an immature way.

124
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,630
We're so sorry about 
disappointing you both, Mothers.

125
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,980
We'll deeply reflect on our behavior.

126
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,800
It's good to reflect. So, what are
 you going to do now?

127
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,910
You're going to split up?

128
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,270
Yes.

129
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,400
And I'll go back to London as soon
 as possible and finish up my schooling.

130
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,750
What did you say?

131
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,660
I plan to get back to
 trying out to be an idol.

132
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,510
Hey, Hae Deun.

133
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,540
You've enjoyed working here. 
What do you mean?

134
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,630
You were so happy that you finally
 found what you love to do.

135
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,470
For me to do that, there are 
so many memories in this place.

136
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,060
And now that I'm breaking up
 with Mr. Makjang,

137
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,040
how can I face Mother... 
no, face CEO again?

138
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,890
I'll do that.

139
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,210
Mom.

140
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,470
I'm freezing from the fire 
sprinkler going off.

141
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,440
I want to go home quickly.

142
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,650
Me, too, Mom. I have the chills.

143
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,990
Aigoo, you do?

144
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,700
Gosh, you must be coming 
down with a cold.

145
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,200
This isn't good. Let's go ahead.

146
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,440
We'll get going first.

147
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,670
All right then.

148
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,420
CEO, I'm sorry about everything.

149
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,160
Mr. Makjang, you have to be happy.

150
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,790
Bounce back to you.

151
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,620
Hey, Hae Deun.

152
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,720
- Soon Jung, go ahead.
- I'll get going.

153
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,490
Goodbye, Mother.

154
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,230
Gosh.

155
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,490
Where did you get these?

156
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,430
They're so sweet.

157
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,580
How is Hae Deun?

158
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,490
Unni keeps crying.

159
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,580
Her eyes are swollen.

160
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,030
Really?

161
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,470
Aigoo, Unni!

162
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,000
Jung Won unni and you are 
being too harsh right now.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Being in love isn't a crime. 
Why are you persecuting them?

164
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,970
What do you mean I'm persecuting them?

165
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,980
They went and got a marriage license 
by themselves without telling us.

166
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,520
Should we let them off the hook?

167
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,950
Then is Unni getting a divorce now?

168
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,210
Ba Reun...

169
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,400
Gosh. I don't know anymore.

170
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,200
- Mom.
- Yeah?

171
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,340
What's Joon Ah doing?

172
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,790
He's sitting out in 
the evening breeze crying.

173
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,540
What? He's crying?

174
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,440
My goodness.

175
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,490
It looks like Joon Ah oppa already 
purchased the airplane tickets.

176
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,790
What's with Joon Ah?

177
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,240
Now that you've quieted down...

178
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,750
Are you two taking turns?

179
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,540
It looks like Hwang Na Ro...

180
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,990
is at the police station.

181
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,750
I got a request to give 
a reference testimony.

182
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,250
I got one, too.

183
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,770
Seo Ah.

184
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,020
Are you okay?

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm okay, Mom.

186
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,250
♫  Even if I close my eyes  ♫

187
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,800
♫  I can still see you  ♫

188
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,600
♫  Even though you're far away  ♫

189
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,100
♫  I can still feel you  ♫

190
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,440
♫  I love you, love you  ♫

191
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,640
♫  Wherever you may be  ♫

192
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:50,100
♫  I will find you  ♫

193
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,330
♫  I love you, love you  ♫

194
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:03,930
♫  Just love me like the
 stars in the sky  ♫

195
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,900
Director.

196
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,420
Chae Woon.

197
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,380
Are you okay?

198
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,540
Yeah.

199
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,130
How is your father?

200
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,760
He's recovering well.

201
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,780
That's good.

202
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,330
I...

203
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,370
wanted to apologize to you.

204
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,950
I've done so many wrongs against you.

205
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,580
I have so many things to apologize for.

206
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,560
I'm sorry, Chae Woon.

207
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,020
It's all my fault.

208
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,980
I really regret it a lot.

209
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,520
Thank you for your apology.

211
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,000
It must be hard for you, too.

212
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,050
In the future, let me know if 
you're struggling with anything.

213
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,710
Let's talk it out together and resolve it.

214
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,270
Thanks.

215
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,230
 Do you have a good idea? 

216
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,840
 Well... 

217
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,790
What is Dad thinking?

218
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,610
What about me?

219
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,070
Aigoo. What brings you
 all the way here?

220
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,750
I came because I heard that the project 
you're working on is going well.

221
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,130
I wanted to see how it's going.

222
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,500
Well, why don't you see 
for yourself how well I'm doing?

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,200
You sound so confident.

224
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,910
Pretty good.

225
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,410
What were you saying earlier?

226
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,670
What do you mean, what am I thinking?

227
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm talking about Samgwang Villa.

228
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,800
Didn't you say that at the jokbal place
 because you know something?

229
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,940
Well?

230
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,110
What is it?

231
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,310
What are you doing, man?

232
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,100
- Please tell me.
- Come on now.

233
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,570
- Please tell me.
- It's ticklish!

234
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,320
What are you trying to do?

235
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,650
Please tell me...

236
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,950
Oh, I see.

237
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,690
So, we can move into 
that place in July?

238
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,300
Yes.

239
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,200
Sir, could you...

240
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,600
please make it work?

241
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,050
Yes, I'll leave it to you.

242
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,840
Gosh, that won't work.

243
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,840
Gosh...

244
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,170
Gosh, something will come up.

245
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,290
 I'm not tired at all. 

246
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,580
 I have so much energy, Mother. 

247
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,920
 I'll rule over these cabbages and
 make them into kimchi.
 

248
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,750
 I'll be in charge of providing 
kimchi at Samgwang Villa.
 

249
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,150
 I'm coming in, Mother. 

250
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,670
 I can fly. Mother! 

251
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,200
My goodness...

252
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,920
I guess I did grow fond of Joon Ah.

253
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,590
In any case, what are we going
 to do about them? This is bad.

254
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,700
 Noonim! 

255
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,370
 Noonim! Noonim! 

256
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,250
- Hwak Se, I'm here.
- Noonim!

257
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,570
- What's up?
- Noonim!

258
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,130
I found out!

259
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,940
I found out where Eun Ji is.

260
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,630
Oh, really? Where? 
In another province?

261
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,760
No, no.

262
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
It's not that far from here.

263
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,320
Really? Hwak Se, let's go 
where Eun Ji is then.

264
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
Okay.

265
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,280
- Then. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

266
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,140
What is that?

267
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,970
You're so pretty.

268
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,310
- Isn't it pretty?
 - Yeah.

269
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,300
Hello?

270
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,150
Yes, Mom. I'm almost finished.

271
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,330
Oh, okay. I'm on my way.

272
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,690
Okay.

273
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,120
Hello.

274
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,590
- Jang Joon Ah.
- Yes?

275
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,580
This is the next season's 
photoshoot concept.

276
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,660
Oh, okay.

277
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,630
Excuse me, this is next season's concept.

278
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,150
Take a look.

279
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,290
Director, please hire a new 
online photo director.

280
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,730
I'll be quitting soon.

281
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,780
Oppa.

282
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,850
Hyung, are you really quitting?

283
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,800
What do we do?

284
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
I'll stop by the design office.

285
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,000
- What's wrong?
- What?

286
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,890
Did you think I'd work here for life?

287
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,370
It's a contract position.

288
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,890
Mom! Hwak Se!

289
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,280
Hi, guys.

290
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,820
Did you wait long?

291
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,800
No.

292
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,040
Did you rush over?

293
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,580
No.

294
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,480
Ra Hoon.

295
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,910
You know...

296
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,230
Thank you.

297
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,470
Thank you. Bye.

298
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,000
Hello.

299
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,310
Ra Hoon.

300
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,920
Well...

301
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,800
Uncle Hwak Se told me you were here.

302
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm running an errand for my mom.

303
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,870
Oh, I see.

304
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,210
This is a tea that's good for your health.

305
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,950
My mom asked me to give it to you.

306
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,580
What a precious gift.

307
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,450
Please tell your mother
 that I said thank you.

308
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,080
Okay.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,730
You said you're going into 
the military soon, right?

310
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,390
Yes.

311
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,510
Be healthy and be well.

312
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,150
Okay.

313
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,900
I will.

314
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,700
You stay healthy, too, ahjumma.

315
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,100
Okay.

316
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,820
I will.

317
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,370
I'd like to buy a bouquet.

318
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,050
Oh, sure.

319
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,750
Wait a minute.

320
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,530
Thank you.

321
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,640
You don't have to pay me.

322
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,680
It's my gift to you.

323
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,510
No, I'm getting it as a gift, too.

324
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,600
No, no. I'm really okay.

325
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,300
Hello.

326
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,710
Is my phone order for a bouquet ready?

327
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Yes.

328
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,680
I'll get going now.

329
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,190
I'll stop by again when
 I come out on a break.

330
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,800
Okay. Do that.

331
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,120
Goodbye.

332
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,130
Give me a moment.

333
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,040
Thank you.

334
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,760
Well...

335
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,540
please...

336
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,490
be well.

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,560
I heard that...

338
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,100
you were very ill before.

339
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,140
I hope you go to the doctor consistently.

340
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,440
Okay. I'll do that.

341
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,340
And...

342
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,610
this is a gift from me.

343
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,120
 Thank you for giving birth to me. 

344
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,600
Wait...

345
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,460
 I'll come back again. 

346
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,640
 Don't get sick and don't be lonely. 

347
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,550
 Please take care... 

348
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,030
 Mom. 

349
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,940
Mom!

350
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,420
Ra Hoon.

351
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,710
Why are you out so soon?

352
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,120
She said she's busy.

353
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,810
I'll visit her again next time.

354
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,110
Let's go, Mom.

355
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,170
Okay, let's go! Your name is?

356
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,760
- Lee Ra Hoon!
- Great!

357
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,310
- It's good!
- Good!

358
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,750
♫   It's good! It's good! It's good!  ♫

359
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,090
♫   Ra Hoon is good   ♫

360
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,050
Ba Reun, you know...

361
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,890
♫   It's perfect! It's perfect! It's perfect!   ♫

362
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,420
♫  Ba Reun is perfect!  ♫

363
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,730
Looks great.

364
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,950
Good. Great.

365
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,670
Great.

366
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,850
Miss, you look a bit tense since 
the guy next to you is so handsome.

367
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,420
Good job. Next models. Where are you?

368
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,060
Okay.

369
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,600
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.

370
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,350
You know...

371
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,940
How could a man be holding a white bag?

372
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,350
- The woman should be...
- This is right, though.

373
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,300
The lady should be 
holding the white one.

374
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,110
The lady is supposed 
to hold the black one.

375
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,840
I mean...

376
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,120
She's wearing a rainbow-colored 
outfit and holding a black bag?

377
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,940
Fine then. Looking good.
 She does everything opposite.

378
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,730
This is the main style.

379
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,720
It looks great.

380
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,470
I see.

381
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,320
I'm ready to give up on 
Joon Ah and Hae Deun.

382
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,840
Now, they're saying they'll get divorced.

383
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,100
Mom.

384
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,190
Joon Ah and Hae Deun are...

385
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,930
behaving so oddly and immaturely.

386
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,550
How about you do the same thing?

387
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,040
What?

388
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,310
Oddly and immaturely?

389
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,370
What the heck is that?

390
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
Seo Yeon! Jae Hee!

391
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,120
When did you get here?

392
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,930
You're supposed to 
be discharged today.

393
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,780
I know. I went to process 
my discharge papers.

394
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,440
But someone paid off 
my medical bills already.

395
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,480
Chae Woon took care of it already.

396
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,550
Thanks, Seo Yeon.

397
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,600
Well, um...

398
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,480
See if you're missing anything.

399
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,620
Why don't you two...

400
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,950
I have to make a phone call.

401
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,250
There's nothing to pack.

402
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,270
You packed everything so well.

403
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,190
You stayed in a study dorm
 all this time, right?

404
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,560
They call it "study dorm," but

405
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,780
all the ahjussis like me live there. 
It's comfortable.

406
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,860
Well, my mom says...

407
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,500
until you fully recover,

408
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,600
how about you stay at Samgwang Villa?

409
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,070
What?

410
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,540
No. I'm too ashamed.

411
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,480
How can I move in there?

412
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,450
Yes, it is too much, right?

413
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,170
Huh?

414
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,950
 She's not going to ask me again? 

415
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,820
Then how about just for a few days?

416
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,080
Then...

417
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,470
should I? Even though 
I'd be shameless?

418
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,360
My Seo Yeon is smiling!

419
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,170
Hey, when you were a baby,

420
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,330
you used to laugh so much 
when I'd say "peekaboo."

421
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,960
You look just like then when you smile.

422
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,900
Put your shoes on.

423
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,510
Okay, will do.

424
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,300
- You came.
- Hello.

425
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,720
Soon Jung, Hwak Se, hello.

426
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,270
Gosh, how can I repay you?

427
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,120
I'm glad you came.

428
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,570
You look much better.

429
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,290
Soon Jung.

430
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,540
Thank you for letting me live
 here at Samgwang Villa.

431
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,130
I'll live diligently from now on.

432
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,470
Seo Yeon, I'll be good from now on.

433
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,100
Jae Hee.

434
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,730
I'm sure you will be from now on.

435
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,620
- Come in.
- Okay.

436
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,270
Mr. Park looks like he's
 in a good mood.

437
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,820
I know.

438
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,080
Chae Woon, you made the right decision.

439
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,620
I cleaned up that room...

440
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,810
I'll go and explain some things to him.

441
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,540
Let's say bye to Mother 
and let's go home.

442
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,700
Why don't we eat out?

443
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,790
Why? Mom will be home early.
 It'd be nice to eat together.

444
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,330
Gosh, Kobong, you should
 be more sensible.

445
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,590
Oh! For Mom and Dad to be alone?

446
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,780
How about we spend 
some time alone, too?

447
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,370
Sounds good.

448
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,350
Aigoo, Jung Min Jae, 
did you have a hard day?

449
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,410
Didn't you go to the jokbal place tonight?

450
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,620
I decided to cut my hours 
at the jokbal place starting today.

451
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,080
How come?

452
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,890
Because I have an
 important guest at home.

453
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,570
I feel the pressure.

454
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,500
Don't feel pressured.

455
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,500
Oh, my!

456
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,950
 

457
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,530
My gosh. When did you install that?

458
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,590
Whether it's a month of a week,

459
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,100
I want to do my best as long as you're in this house.

460
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,570
Having fun like this.

461
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:49,530
I never thought I'd have a chance
 to live with you again.

462
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,930
This is such a big gift to me.

463
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,300
Come this way for a minute.

464
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,800
While you were living with me,

465
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,340
you never had a room of your own.

466
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,830
You can take care of 
your business here and read.

467
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,290
I put it together for you to 
spend some time for yourself.

468
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,990
What do you think? Do you like it?

469
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,160
Gosh, you don't know if I'll leave

470
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,080
after a month or a week.

471
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,740
Why did you put an office together?

472
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,090
Don't worry.

473
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,020
If you leave, I'll use it as my office.

474
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,120
Jung Soon?

475
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,370
Your sister?

476
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,000
She must be calling about 
the ancestral ceremony.

477
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,930
Hi, Jung Soon.

478
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,730
Yeah, I know.

479
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,060
But starting this year, let's minimize
 ancestral ceremonies in our family.

480
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,460
And let's delegate workload for 
family events and ancestral ceremonies.

481
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,740
Let's break it down evenly.

482
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,170
Gosh, why are you shocked?

483
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,770
From now on, follow Min Jae's direction

484
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,310
and bring all the food that 
you make yourself.

485
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,720
Got it?

486
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,200
Welcome.

487
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,570
Jung Won.

488
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,510
Are you feeling all right?

489
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,690
Of course.

490
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,890
I'm full of energy now.

491
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,390
Well, I'm staying at Samgwang Villa.

492
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,360
I heard it from Seo Yeon.

493
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,270
That's great.

494
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,690
You must still pay her monthly rent.

495
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,680
Help out Soon Jung, too.

496
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,560
Of course. I will.

497
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,630
Would you like some coffee?

498
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,140
No, it's okay.

499
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,690
You know...

500
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,910
if it's okay with you,

501
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,920
I'd like to have to make our samples.

502
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,320
When the design is approved, 
we have to make the samples right away.

503
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,690
Really?

504
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,950
That'd be great!

505
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,720
I'll do a great job!

506
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
Thank you, my Jung Won.

507
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,720
Please. Stop saying that.

508
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,910
Yes, CEO.

509
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,970
Then...

510
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,710
if I do a good job,

511
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,710
could I be able to get 
a full-time job at LX...

512
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,220
Gosh.

513
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,930
I'm joking. I'll work hard, CEO.

514
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,500
Park Pil Hong.

515
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,620
Actually...

516
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,100
I resented you a lot.

517
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,360
But I decided to forget all that.

518
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,500
Instead, I'd like you to be...

519
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,570
a father she won't be ashamed of.

520
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,280
I'll keep that in mind.

521
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,990
Thank you for forgiving me.

522
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,960
Thanks, my Jung...

523
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
My CEO.

524
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,770
I thought it was a night flight.

525
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,280
Leaving so early?

526
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,840
I want to stop by Samgwang Villa
 and say goodbye.

527
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,640
Right. You should.

528
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,100
I'm sorry for leaving again.

529
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,280
I can't help that.

530
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,330
It's because I'm not 
making you feel at home.

531
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,880
Gosh, Mom. It's not like that at all.

532
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,910
Let's not make excuses, okay?

533
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,180
Oppa, are you really leaving?

534
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,620
Can't you just cancel it now?

535
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,640
Hey, be good to Mom.

536
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,020
Take care of Mom.

537
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,550
Oppa.

538
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,900
Stay healthy, Mom.

539
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,310
Okay.

540
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,760
But when are you getting your divorce?

541
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,210
Pardon?

542
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,170
Divorce? When I get to London,

543
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,100
after things go well... I'll do it then.

544
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,640
Okay. Take care of it 
if you're going to do it.

545
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,790
Don't hang onto someone else's 
precious daughter as a missus.

546
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,050
- You made the right decision.
- Okay.

547
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,750
- Goodbye.
- Pardon?

548
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,170
Mom.

549
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,830
I'll go now.

550
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,490
Take care... Mom, I'm leaving.

551
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,800
Really...

552
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,660
- Call me.
- Wait.

553
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,760
Mom, I'm really leaving.

554
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,450
Mom?

555
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,910
Go.

556
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,340
Go now.

557
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,910
Go.

558
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,390
Go. I'll walk you out.

559
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,080
Go.

560
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,100
Thank you for everything.

561
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,770
Okay, Joon Ah.

562
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,920
Getting the marriage license 
without telling me

563
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,680
is so disappointing, 
even if I think about it now.

564
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,940
But since you're parting ways...

565
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,890
Please be sure to take care 
of the paperwork thoroughly.

566
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,150
Okay.

567
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,940
Joon Ah, I'm so disappointed in you.

568
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,070
Is getting a marriage license a joke?

569
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,280
Is being in love that easy?

570
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,270
Why do you keep flip-flopping?

571
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,630
So...

572
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,780
I'm so disappointed in you.

573
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,000
Gosh, it's unbelievable.

574
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,660
I'm really sorry.

575
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,330
Words aren't good enough.

576
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,900
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry.

577
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,900
- What? What?
- Well...

578
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,470
I'll get going.

579
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,650
Auntie, stay healthy. You, too, Uncle...

580
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,120
Ra Hoon and Ba Reun...

581
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,350
Just go if you're set to go!

582
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,290
Okay.

583
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,820
Do you think we'll stop you?

584
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,020
Where is Hae Deun...

585
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,600
Why are you asking us?

586
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,480
What about Hae Deun? 
You're breaking up anyway.

587
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,280
Hey, Lee Hae Deun, come in.

588
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
Say goodbye.

589
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,300
Bye.

590
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,000
What is she doing? Leave now.

591
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,510
Stay healthy.

592
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,210
Who cares whether he's healthy or not?

593
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,790
I'll be going now.

594
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,840
Anyone following us?

595
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,020
Don't look. Don't look.

596
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,360
What the heck? This isn't the
 scenario we worked up.

597
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,540
I know.

598
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,790
At this point, they should say, 
"Why get divorced? Just live together."

599
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,990
Gosh, look at this.
 I knew this would happen.

600
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,280
According to our scenario,
 if people stopped us,

601
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,120
we were going to put on a show saying,
 "We'll get divorced!"

602
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,830
But then give in and stay together. 
That was our plan.

603
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,590
But look what they're thinking now.

604
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,870
They're all thinking, "Yeah, it's better 
for you to break up."

605
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,460
Geez, this is crazy.
 What do we do, Hae Deun?

606
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,007
What should we do now?

607
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:41,910
Geez, what else could we do?

608
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,360
I'll go back to London.

609
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,600
You're going to London?

610
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
I have to. What else could I do?

611
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,950
I'll go there and come back.

612
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,310
Must we part ways like this?

613
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,130
You're really leaving?

614
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,030
Of course, I have to go.

615
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,760
Should we just go back and beg?

616
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,340
Should we beg? Tell them 
we faked everything?

617
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,180
Check and see what time your flight is.

618
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,550
Oh, okay. I put it in my passport.

619
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,750
- Huh?
- What?

620
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,010
Wait a minute. This is...

621
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,580
- I'm this sensible?
- Why?

622
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,320
It looks like I brought my old passport.

623
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,900
- What?
- Huh?

624
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,930
- Eh?
- Huh?

625
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,800
We should do this!

626
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,830
Let's go and have fun somewhere

627
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,200
and try to get out of the country

628
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,590
and say I brought my old passport

629
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,160
and sneak back into
 the house and sit back.

630
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,990
Then people will say,
 "Why are you guys back here?"

631
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,940
Then we can say something about 
an old passport and sit around.

632
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,720
For the rest of our lives. 
How is it? Isn't it good?

633
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,330
- Are you sure you're not a genius?
- I'm sure I am!

634
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,740
- I'm so glad!
- We made it.

635
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,000
- I'm so glad you don't have to go.
- We got it.

636
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,330
My goodness...

637
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,910
Mom.

638
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,000
Hey.

639
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,750
Are you that happy that you 
brought the wrong passport?

640
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,270
You didn't know that
 I swapped it earlier, huh?

641
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,000
You swapped it, Mom?

642
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,740
Mom.

643
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,560
Aigoo, Hae Deun.

644
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,860
You guys, this is so heart-wrenching.

645
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,570
How dare you try to fool your moms?

646
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,230
Did you think we wouldn't know
 what you were up to?

647
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,550
CEO, what should we do with these two?

648
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,370
I know.

649
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,450
Geez.

650
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,880
As for the time of contemplation...

651
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,780
We'll have to shorten it.

652
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,130
- What?
- What?

653
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,240
Six months.

654
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,290
What?

655
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,860
Six months are too long.

656
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,490
Isn't it too long, Mom?

657
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,180
What?

658
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,020
Aigoo.

659
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,200
Should we be a little bit more generous?

660
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,070
Should we?

661
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,970
How about a month?

662
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,890
A month is actually too long.

663
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,350
What do you mean a month is too long?

664
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,060
It'll take a month just to 
prepare for a wedding.

665
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,390
That's right.

666
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,650
Wait a minute. So we can 
live together in a month?

667
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,400
That's right.

668
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,770
Really?

669
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,970
We did it! We did it!

670
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,560
Mom! Mom!

671
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,160
My gosh!

672
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,330
Thanks, Mom.

673
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,000
- My goodness.
- Congrats!

674
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,310
Are you that happy?

675
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,350
♫   It's good! It's good! It's good!  ♫

676
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,690
♫   Spinach is very good   ♫

677
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,980
Cook it on high heat.

678
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,750
- Hotter.
- Sesame seeds.

679
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,230
Put plenty.

680
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,280
Aigoo, lower the heat.

681
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,270
On low heat.

682
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,490
- We're home!
- We're home.

683
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,170
You're home, my nephew.

684
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,860
Ra Hoon, Ba Reun, coming
 home from work?

685
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,340
We stopped by the clothing repair shop, 
and Mr. Park came with us.

686
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,710
- Really?
 - Yes.

687
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,290
Hello.

688
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,760
Aigoo.

689
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

690
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,210
Hello.

691
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,690
Thanks for including me.

692
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,090
It's the night before Ra Hoon 
leaves for the military.

693
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,480
I thought we'd all get 
together for dinner.

694
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,520
Hello.

695
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,900
Hello.

696
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,570
I'm so glad you came.

697
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,430
We're making yummy food.

698
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,830
Aigoo.

699
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,540
- Hi, Unni.
- Seo Ah, welcome.

700
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,790
- Hello.
- Welcome, Mother.

701
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,550
- How have you been?
- Good.

702
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,610
CEO, thank you for coming.

703
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,410
Of course, I should come. 
You're going to enlist tomorrow.

704
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,160
Thank you.

705
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,080
Thank you, CEO!

706
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,380
No, no.

707
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,330
I'll work hard!

708
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,970
I can do a good job! 
Yes, CEO. Thank you!

709
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,330
What's going on?

710
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,950
Oh, my God!

711
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,650
What's going on?

712
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,050
- It's okay.
- What, what?

713
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,550
Noonim!

714
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,080
Noonim, I...

715
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,150
I think I'll sign on as a singer.

716
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,370
Daebak!

717
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,810
A singer.

718
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,310
My goodness.

719
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,890
My gosh...

720
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,270
He actually received a call
 a few days ago.

721
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,210
An agency asked him
 if he'd work with them.

722
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,640
And he just got the call confirming it.

723
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,250
Which agency? Which agency?

724
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,020
I didn't target them for this, but...

725
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,140
you know my song, "It's good"?

726
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,810
- It's called Goodshiya Entertainment.
- Goodshiya?

727
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,300
That Goodshiya Entertainment? 
Where lots of famous trot singers are with?

728
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,380
- Is that it?
- That's right.

729
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,850
Wow, daebak!

730
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,340
Daebak!

731
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,120
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

732
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,480
Wow, congratulations, Hyungnim. 
You'll hit it big now.

733
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,500
That's for sure!

734
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,920
Hwak Se, congratulations.

735
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,550
I'm so happy to hear such good news 
on the day before Ra Hoon enlists.

736
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,750
Thank you, Noonim.

737
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,620
This is all thanks to
 your loving support, Noonim.

738
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,180
I didn't do much. Thank you so much.

739
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,430
Gosh, Uncle. Don't cry!

740
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,320
What did I do?

741
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,570
Man Jung worked so hard with you.

742
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,540
No, Unni. You did a lot.

743
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,080
- Hwak Se...
- Auntie, you're about to cry.

744
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,870
You're about to cry.

745
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,010
My Hwak Se is going to shine now.

746
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,790
He'll be a star now. 
I knew this would happen.

747
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,110
Now, now. Even though
 the table isn't set,

748
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,220
a round of applause
 for Hwak Se hyungnim!

749
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,050
Thank you!

750
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,980
- Thank you!
- Hooray for Kim Hwak Se!

751
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,420
Hey, we can't have this tonight.

752
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,410
Let's go out tonight. It's on me!

753
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,850
Let's go out to eat!

754
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,000
- What do you want to eat?
- We're here!

755
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,480
What?

756
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,560
Welcome, Father.

757
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,620
You must have good news tonight.

758
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,960
But we can't go out to eat tonight.

759
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,500
It's my treat tonight!

760
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,290
I was craving jokbal earlier.

761
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,080
I heard Ra Hoon is going
 to the military tomorrow.

762
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,100
So I brought some home.

763
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,020
Okay, Ra Hoon.

764
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,750
It's so good!

765
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,600
Uncle, have some.

766
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,670
Eat some, Uncle.

767
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,900
- Have some jokbal.
- I'm Kim Hwak Se, debuting as a singer.

768
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,190
Then...

769
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,690
you're the one who purchased
 the Samgwang Villa?

770
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,640
My goodness...

771
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,620
I heard that...

772
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:14,640
Ms. Noh in the US said 
she's selling Samgwang Villa.

773
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,540
I was so stunned by the news.

774
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,080
You must've.

775
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,760
You must've been in shock.

776
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,120
I wanted to tell you after
 everything wrapped up.

777
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm so sorry.

778
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,390
Actually, I heard that you had to 
move out of here sooner than later.

779
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,690
So we were looking for a new place.

780
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,480
You did?

781
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,140
Yes, we felt so bad watching you 
ask around for a place,

782
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,720
so we were all looking.

783
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
So...

784
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,590
Dad has an offer for you.

785
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,060
Yeah.

786
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,320
I'm the one who purchased 
Samgwang Villa.

787
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,790
But I was wondering if you'd 
be a co-owner of this place.

788
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,960
My goodness. Me?

789
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,760
My gosh, I'm not that 
well off to do that...

790
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,300
I was looking for another place to lease.

791
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,610
That's why I'm suggesting 
we become co-owners.

792
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,860
Put the deposit that you were going
 to put down for another place here

793
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,130
and I'll add to that.

794
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,530
We'll also add some.

795
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,510
Whoa, daebak.

796
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,690
Yes, in a way, we'll all become 
Samgwang Villa's owner.

797
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,840
As you've always done, you'll be
 in charge of the maintenance.

798
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,430
Yes, In-law.

799
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,690
He often said that 
Samgwang Villa is the

800
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,580
most meaningful place in his life.

801
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,970
Mother.

802
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,530
This is a very important place for me.

803
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,670
I got to meet my Chae Woon...

804
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,570
and met my father.

805
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,530
Please make up your mind, Mother.

806
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,540
What a wonderful idea 
you came up with.

807
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,510
It's great, Soon Jung.

808
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,250
Wow, our In-law does 
everything in style.

809
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,980
That's right. So awesome.

810
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,760
Soon Jung, this is so great.

811
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,870
Thank you so much for everything.

812
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,220
Don't say that.

813
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,800
Samgwang Villa is meaningful 
because you're here, In-law.

814
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,290
That's right, In-law.

815
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,690
Mom.

816
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,190
If that's the case,

817
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,130
from what I'm hearing...

818
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,460
we should all applaud once again.

819
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:40,190
For the new birth of Samgwang Villa! 
Put your hands together!

820
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,250
Thank you!

821
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,190
Thank you!

822
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,410
Here you go!

823
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,380
All righty!

824
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,790
I can't believe we don't have 
to move out of Samgwang Villa.

825
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,960
This is so wonderful.

826
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,530
Aigoo...

827
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,330
I wanted to stay longer, 
but you wanted to leave...

828
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,500
Because we didn't eat dessert,

829
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,150
I think In-law was disappointed.

830
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,870
We should leave the party early

831
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,460
so that the Samgwang Villa
 people could party on.

832
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,630
Is that right?

833
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,400
And I have something to do.

834
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,140
Work again?

835
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,940
Anyway, you were so cool today.

836
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,290
When did you come up with the mission 
to purchase Samgwang Villa?

837
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,210
I'm pretty cool, huh?

838
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,620
Get some rest.

839
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,070
Jung Min Jae.

840
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:17,170
Even though we live together 
without being a married couple,

841
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,490
I'm so happy that you're back,
 Jung Min Jae.

842
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,470
Now that you're back,

843
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,830
this house feels full now,

844
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,450
and I feel like something is going right.

845
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,780
Well, I also feel like...

846
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,690
this house feels more 
comfortable, unlike before.

847
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,380
If that's the case,

848
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,050
I guess I could say this with courage.

849
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,710
Say what?

850
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,000
Jung Min Jae.

851
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,170
What do you think...

852
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,360
of starting over again?

853
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:11,700
I want to start a new dating 
relationship with you.

854
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:23,940
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

855
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,340
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

856
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,830
I guess...

857
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,180
I rushed it.

858
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,200
I'm sorry. Don't feel pressured.

859
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,300
Do you know...

860
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,050
this is your first time making 
such a love confession to me?

861
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,490
Is it?

862
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,510
A long time ago,

863
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,280
I'm the one who told you 
about my feelings first.

864
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,550
♫  When I see you  ♫

865
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,150
Jung Hoo oppa.

866
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,240
Let's date.

867
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,740
Date?

868
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,390
Well...

869
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,350
Let's date.

870
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,870
Okay?

871
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,360
Please?

872
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,730
♫  I got soaked in an unexpected love  ♫

873
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,700
I like you, Oppa.

874
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,390
Let's date.

875
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,900
You like me?

876
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,180
♫  You became the meaning  ♫

877
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,910
♫  The one who taught me love  ♫

878
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,360
I guess you did.

879
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:37,750
Ever since then, 
I guess I've been so dense.

880
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,090
I'm sorry for everything.

881
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,830
But even so...

882
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,220
back then...

883
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,510
and since then, even now...

884
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,230
you're the only love I have in my heart.

885

♫  When I see you, I can smile  ♫

886
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,560
Jung Hoo.

887
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,890
I...

888
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,490
will accept your love confession.

889
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:24,410
♫  The rain called you is making me wet  ♫

890
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,800
At times, I hated you...

891
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,710
and resented you.

892
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,420
But you're someone I can't ignore.

893
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,110
I keep thinking of you out of concern.

894
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,400
I worry about you.

895
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,520
Thank you for...

896
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,860
working hard and...

897
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,090
changing for me.

00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,600
Thank you.

901
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,990
Thank you, Min Jae.

Thank you.

I'll be good.

908
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,620
I'll be good to you from now on.

909
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,630
You have to, okay?

910
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:37,430
I'll be good to you. I'll be good.

Thank you. Thank you.

00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,240
Aigoo.

914
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,720
Lying down like this reminds me
 of the good old days. Right?

915
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,070
Right, Unni?

916
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,840
When Mom went to work, the three 
of us slept like this all the time.

917
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,980
I was afraid you'd go away, so I'd put
 yarn around your wrist.

918
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,470
And...

919
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,640
we tried to have Chae Woon noona 
or Mom to ourselves

920
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,050
- so we used to fight.
- That's right.

921
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,420
So funny.

922
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,280
Gosh, you guys...

923
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,890
You guys met a poor mom...

924
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,170
and lived in one room together.

925
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,010
You all went through a lot.

926
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,110
We went through a lot?

927
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,490
Hey, did you guys suffer?

928
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,720
 No, not at all. 

929
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,840
That's right.

930
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,330
We met a rich mom, 
and we were so happy.

931
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,950
Full of love and warmth.

932
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,760
- That's why we grew up so well.
- Right. That's right.

933
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,300
Thank you, Mom.

934
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,010
Thank you, Mom.

935
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,600
Mom...

936
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,370
I thank you, too.

937
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,630
Hey, Mom is tired. Get away from her.

938
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,490
Get away. Hurry.

939
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,710
She's mine!

940
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,520
No, what are you doing? Move!

941
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,350
- You'll get hurt.
- She's mine!

942
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,970
Gosh, Mom is tired.

943
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:53,200
- Everyone, come here.
- I'm going to the military tomorrow.

944
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,770
Get out. Get out then.

945
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,550
I'm going to the military tomorrow.

946
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,140
You'll get hurt.

947
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,340
I said I wanted to go to
 the training center with you.

948
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,180
But you won't let me come.

949
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,510
No.

950
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,600
Everyone, come for the
 training completion ceremony.

951
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,850
Okay?

952
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:14,790
We should let him spend some 
sweet time with Ba Reun.

953
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,850
Right. We should.

954
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,260
Ra Hoon.

955
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:21,290
Stay healthy and safe.

956
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,700
As long as you remember the tips 
I gave you, you'll be discharged in no time.

957
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,130
Yes, Uncle!

958
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,820
- I'll be good.
- Good, good.

959
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,040
Let me give you a hug.

960
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,780
Good luck, my nephew.

961
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,040
My auntie, be happy with Uncle.

962
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,550
Don't want to.

963
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,060
Hey.

964
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,470
Chae Woon noona.

965
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,140
I'll write you.

966
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,010
- Stay healthy.
- Okay.

967
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,780
I'll wait for my nephew.

968
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,520
Come on now.

969
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,590
Mom.

970
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,490
Aigoo...

971
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,370
Ra Hoon.

972
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:09,910
You know that I'm always
 with you, right?

973
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,390
Of course. I know it well.

974
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,200
Okay.

975
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,540
And I'll look after Eun Ji.

976
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,740
Don't worry. Okay?

977
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,320
Yes, Mom. Thank you.

978
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,690
I love you.

979
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,270
I love you, too.

980
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,290
Private Lee Ra Hoon!

981
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,570
I'll stay healthy and will be back!

982
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,930
See you later.

983
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,400
Bye! Go!

984
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,840
We won't turn back!

985
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,080
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Be careful.

986
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,960
Whether he goes or stays, we're going in.

987
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,230
What?

988
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,670
Nothing. Let's go.

989
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,490
Have you been well?

990
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,300
Yes.

991
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,110
Are you sick or anything?

992
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,150
I'm fine.

993
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,610
Look at me.

994
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,140
We haven't seen each other 
for a long time.

995
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,990
Don't come and visit me from now on.

996
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,790
I came out to say that to you.

997
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,090
I won't come out next time.

998
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,110
As you wish.

999
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,500
But I'll still come every now and then.

1000
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,740
I can't help it if you won't see me.

1001
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,910
Just remember that I'm thinking of you.

1002
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,950
Later...

1003
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,450
Way later...

1004
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,600
When you come out to the world...

1005
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,700
turn me down then.

1006
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,970
I'll be your friend until then.

1007
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,290
Okay?

1008
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,890
Try it. Thanks to you, 
I'm seeing a new world.

1009
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,040
No wonder you have no idea 
there's stuff like this.

1010
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,060
♫  I like you  ♫

1011
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,020
♫  I only trust you  ♫

1012
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,600
So pretty.

1013
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,210
- Looks good.
- Is it?

1014
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,280
Okay.

1015
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,060
- Jung Min Jae, try one.
- Look, look.

1016
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,050
Wow!

1017
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,760
- One, two, three.
- Take the picture.

1018
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,170
One more time.

1019
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,730
Again. One, two, three.

1020
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,730
So delicious.

1021
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,690
This is so good.

1022
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,090
Min Jae...

1023
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,250
Have a bite.

1024
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,780
- Say ah.
- My gosh.

1025
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,600
Take a bite.

1026
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,350
Say ah.

1027
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,760
Aigoo, good.

1028
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,330
It's so good.

1029
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,060
Then, Chae Woon, say ah.

1030
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,470
You copycats.

1031
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,260
♫  I can tell by the look in your eyes  ♫

1032
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,150
Is something in it?

1033
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,620
Why?

1034
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,320
- Excuse me.
- Should I come with you?

1035
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,950
It's right there.

1036
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:22,630
♫  Someone to be with for life  ♫

1037
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,800
Is Chae Woon having indigestion 
from lunch earlier?

1038
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,510
Jae Hee.

1039
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,630
Do you guys have good news?

1040
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,540
I couldn't tell you because 
we're being cautious.

1041
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,620
We went to the hospital yesterday.

1042
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,900
She's seven weeks pregnant.

1043
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,490
My gosh.

1044
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,280
I'm so thankful.

1045
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,720
Congratulations. Congrats.

1046
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,810
My goodness, Jae Hee!

1047
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,270
Oh, my goodness!

1048
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,900
Congratulations!

1049
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,010
Thank you, Dad and Mom.

1050
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,160
Oh, Chae Woon, be careful.

1051
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,780
We heard the news.

1052
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,400
I'm so grateful.

1053
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,940
Congratulations. Congrats.

1054
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,980
Thank you, Father.

1055
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,850
Congratulations, Chae Woon.

1056
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,710
I'm so happy for you, 
my pretty daughter-in-law.

1057
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,410
Thank you, Mother.

1058
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:17,570
How do you feel? You must 
be having morning sickness.

1059
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,840
Yes. I'm okay.

1060
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,680
Let's be careful, okay?

1061
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,520
Yes, be careful. Be very careful.

1062
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,930
Always be careful.

1063
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,560
Be careful.

1064
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,020
Be careful.

1065
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,540
What do I do?

1066
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,850
What?

1067
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,310
I'll be a grandma now.

1068
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,130
I'll be a grandpa, too.

1069
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:43,530
♫  I love you  ♫

1070
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,830
You're so pretty. This is crazy. Seriously.

1071
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:57,570
I know I'm pretty.

1072
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,170
But this isn't just pretty.

1073
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,560
You look like a goddess.

1074
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,210
So pretty. Let me kiss you.

1075
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,690
Just once.

1076
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,510
Let me kiss you once.

1077
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,160
- Mom. CEO.
- Hello.

1078
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,930
Aigoo, my daughter is so pretty.

1079
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,810
You're so pretty.

1080
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:16,150
But I think the other dress
 looks better on you.

1081
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:17,560
It looks more high-quality.

1082
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,170
CEO, this design is trendy these days.

1083
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,320
Just because it's expensive
 doesn't mean it's all good.

1084
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,360
Gosh, Hae Deun.

1085
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,450
Director Lee.

1086
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,810
Then why don't you wear the dress, CEO?

1087
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,650
What?

1088
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,170
Okay. I'll wear it.

1089
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,370
I'll wear it and get married, too.

1090
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,540
Really?

1091
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,880
Yeah.

1092
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,880
Anyway, Hae Deun and I are in trouble.

1093
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,180
We argue about everything little thing.

1094
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,980
Mom, this is how you grow 
fond of each other.

1095
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:52,030
Please be nice to Hae Deun. Please...

1096
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,780
Look at you.

1097
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,420
I'll take the picture.

1098
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,170
One, two.

1099
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,780
One more time. One, two.

1100
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:06,710
 Jo Woo Jong's FM Show's guest. 

1101
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,520
-  Up can coming trot singer. 
- It's Uncle.

1102
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,010
 - We have Kim Hwak Se with us. Hello. 
- Uncle is on TV.

1103
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,050
 I'm Kim Hwak Se. Nice to meet you. 

1104
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,350
 There were so many 
welcome texts for you. 

1105
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,270
 Kim Hwak Se, fighting!  

1106
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,760
 - Only flowery paths for your future. 
- It's Uncle.

1107
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,650
 "It's good" is so good. 

1108
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,740
 - It's so good. 
- Look at Uncle.

1109
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:25,720
 I got to be here thanks to 
my family at Samgwang Villa. 

1110
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,710
It will scare him.
 He'll cry if it's too noisy.

1111
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,810
Let's watch later.

1112
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,940
My Ji Wan, who do you take 
after that you're so handsome?

1113
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,530
- You look after your daddy?
- That's right.

1114
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,080
The kid is definitely handsome.

1115
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,550
But he kind of looks like a koala.

1116
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,900
Hey, isn't he a koala that 
turned into a human being?

1117
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,050
You.

1118
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,060
- Oppa.
- I'm kidding.

1119
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,640
Younger sister-in-law Chae Woon, 
while we're at it...

1120
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,820
Younger sister-in-law Chae Woon, 
shouldn't you call me "unni" by now?

1121
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,510
What did you say?

1122
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,500
Come here. What did you just say?

1123
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,350
Auntie is so funny.

1124
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,870
Look at your mommy!

1125
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,880
Hi, Auntie!

1126
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,810
- Hello.
- You came from Cheongju?

1127
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,360
- Ji Wan, Auntie is here.
- Aren't you tired?

1128
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,760
Of course, I'm tired.

1129
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,260
Ji Wan!

1130
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,150
Auntie, I heard you're all over
 the place at Cheongju Hospital.

1131
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,560
I know.

1132
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,720
The rumor is that you'll be the
 next director of internal medicine.

1133
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,280
Gosh, how can I be all 
over the place in this state?

1134
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,400
Uncle Hwak Se... it must be 
tough for him in Cheongju.

1135
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,270
To go back and forth from Cheongju
 to the TV station in Seoul.

1136
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:29,500
I know.

1137
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,490
But he says he's so happy.

1138
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,580
I'm sure Uncle is so happy.

1139
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,490
Every song he releases 
becomes popular.

1140
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,860
Gosh, you scared us!

1141
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:42,460
Jjung-a, did you get here okay?

1142
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,970
It was so tough for me.

1143
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,660
Aigoo, maybe because 
you're carrying a twin.

1144
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,190
Aigoo, my princess, 
did you get here okay?

1145
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,370
It was tough. It was so hard.

1146
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,210
Hello.

1147
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,010
- Father.
- Hello.

1148
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,190
Hello.

1149
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,540
I'm taking a break from work.
 I finished this.

1150
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,050
Whoa, a stuffed animal!

1151
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,390
It's so cute. Ji Wan!

1152
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,260
- Grandpa.
- Ji Wan.

1153
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,420
It's a gift from your grandpa.

1154
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,830
Do you like it?

1155
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,180
Aigoo.

1156
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,680
Good, good, good.

1157
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,220
Good, good, good.

1158
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,890
Good, good, good.

1159
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,360
Everyone is here.

1160
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,040
Hello, Mother.

1161
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,250
Hello, Writer Lee Soon Jung.

1162
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:27,520
- Hello.
- Hi, you're home.

1163
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,230
Everyone got together because 
your book got released today.

1164
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:33,290
I was going to give you a ride,

1165
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,150
but you left ahead.

1166
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,620
Gosh, I was so excited.

1167
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,350
I was so shy about it, too.

1168
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,660
Aigoo.

1169
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:44,260
I wanted to have an alone time 
when I released my first album.

1170
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,300
Because I got so excited.

1171
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,440
I totally know how you feel.

1172
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,990
My Soon Jung noonim...

1173
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,280
No. My sister-in-law.

1174
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,780
Unni.

1175
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,090
Your book isn't out
 in the bookstores yet.

1176
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,590
What? It's out.

1177
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,490
 
(Soon Jung also means "love," 
so it could also mean "Young Love")

1178
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,460
I want to see it, too.

1179
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,000
The book looks so nice.

1180
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,310
It's so cool!

1181
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:10,550
 

1182
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,020
- Mom.
- Yes...

1183
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,110
Unni, congratulations.

1184
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,740
Thanks.

1185
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,540
How could your first novel 
be published  like that?

1186
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,170
Wow, daebak.

1187
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:25,060
I know. Mother, I'm so shocked.

1188
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,080
Congratulations, Mother.

1189
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,950
We should call her 
Writer Lee Soon Jung from now on.

1190
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,940
 Writer! 

1191
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,630
All right, all right.

1192
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,360
You've waited a long time.

1193
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:38,010
To congratulate Writer Lee Soon Jung's 
first published book,

1194
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,520
why don't we take 
a commemorative photo?

1195
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,420
 Sounds great! 

1196
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,510
Congratulations!

1197
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,090
Congratulations!

1198
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,080
Welcome.

1199
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,820
All right, everyone. 
Let's gather around.

1200
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,370
Get closer.

1201
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,530
Okay, I'll set this up.

1202
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:00,570
I'll go in. One, two, okay.

1203
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,680
Okay, one, two...

1204
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,410
We're here!

1205
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:08,390
 Welcome! 

1206
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,870
Seo Ah, welcome.

1207
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,560
Two more important guests are here.

1208
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,040
So we'll figure out the 
composition one more time.

1209
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,260
Okay, this way a little bit. All right.

1210
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,230
Looks great.

1211
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,790
I'll do it for sure this time.

1212
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,090
Okay.

1213
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,820
Good, good.

1214
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,610
- One, two...
- Just a moment!

1215
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,640
 Ra Hoon! 

1216
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,460
Ta-da!

1217
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,660
 Ra Hoon is home! 

1218
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,220
 Come into the picture! 

1219
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,550
Let's take a picture.

1220
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,820
Let's take a picture now.

1221
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,380
Everyone, Private Lee Ra Hoon 
will be joining us unexpectedly.

1222
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,330
Let's set this up again.

1223
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,790
Okay, today is a happy day.

1224
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,080
Please focus.

1225
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,100
I'll really take it this time.

1226
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,540
Okay. Let's do it!

1227
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,800
Okay.

1228
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,050
- One, two...
- Wait!

1229
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,890
What now?

1230
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,650
- Stop the camera.
- The petals.

1231
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,230
Gosh, Unni!

1232
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,060
Let's make a wish as we 
blow the petals in the air.

1233
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,030
 Great! 

1234
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:19,040
Okay, take one, everyone.

1235
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,720
 Although we're not blood-related, 

1236
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,420
 if we trust and love each other, 

1237
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,960
 this is a true family. 

1238
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,030
 I love you. 

1239
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,940
This time is for sure. Okay.

1240
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,440
Hurry.

1241
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,160
One, two, three.

1242
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:44,520
♫  You're the only one  ♫

1243
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,130
 So pretty! 

1244
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,590
 Lee Ra Hoon, you should've
 told us you're coming. 

1245
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,220
 I wanted to surprise you! 

1246
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,890
 You got to take pictures 
with Kim Hwak Se! 

1247
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:15,060
 Ra Hoon, I can't believe you're home! 

1248
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,110
