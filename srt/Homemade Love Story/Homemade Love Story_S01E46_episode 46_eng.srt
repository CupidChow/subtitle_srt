1
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,640
 

2
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,420
Jae Hee.

3
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,130
If someone saw you,

4
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,210
they'd think Chae Woon is 
dating another man.

5
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,860
What? Chae Woon?

6
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,180
You're overreacting the most 
out of the four of us.

7
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,610
How can I not overreact?

8
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,620
Mom says she's dating Professor Son.

9
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,850
And you say you're dating someone, Dad.

10
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,180
I'm not dating Professor Son!

11
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,830
Your dad is making assumptions!

12
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,000
What did I assume exactly?

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,030
Besides, let's say
 I'm dating Professor Son.

14
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,920
Is that something for you to
 gulp down ice water for?

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,860
You're not Woo Jung Hoo. 
Why are you making a fuss?

16
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,700
Mom and Dad, both of you are...

17
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,010
My family is about to disintegrate midair.

18
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,100
 It already did! 

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,310
It already did?

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,450
Jae Hee, let's calm down a bit.

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,770
So, fine. Okay.

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,880
Dad, let me ask you again.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,610
Are you really dating someone?
 You're not, right?

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,050
You just said it out of anger, right?

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,250
Nope.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,500
You really have someone?

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,390
Yeah, I do.

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,180
Where...

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,630
Where did you meet her exactly?

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,010
Well, as for that...

31
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,230
Anyway...

32
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,130
Why should I brief you about this?

33
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,760
Your son.

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm curious as your son.

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,400
I'm curious as your ex-wife, too.

36
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,980
Well, you know...

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,710
After I got my memory back,

38
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,500
my heart was in disarray.

39
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,120
I got a divorce late in my life, and...

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,350
I kept wondering what's
 happened to my life.

41
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,900
Just looking at a bare tree branch

42
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,330
brought about a cold wind in my heart.

43
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,930
In that midst...

44
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,380
In that midst, and?

45
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,300
You know Mr. Kim from one 
of my closest vendors?

46
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,800
The one who became
 a widower ten years ago?

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,010
Yeah, I heard that Mr. Kim...

48
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,130
got introduced to a nice lady
 through a dating service

49
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,800
and is dating someone.

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,100
Wait. Wait...

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,740
So you signed up for that service?

52
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,850
Yeah.

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,220
Oh, my God.

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,430
Oh, my.

55
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:30,160
It's a small matchmaking service 
that's been around for years.

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,450
They're not all about making a profit,

57
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,380
and the members were 
well-mannered like me.

58
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,500
I got introduced to her through them.

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,360
Oh, my world...

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,270
What in the world?

61
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,530
Wait, Dad... Dad...

62
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,840
Wait...

63
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,200
Noonim.

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,330
Coming home just now?

65
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,990
Yes, I went to visit Jae Hee.

66
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,850
Are you going out?

67
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,250
I'm going for a walk. 
Ba Wi just fell asleep.

68
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,180
Would you like to go with me?

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,840
I guess it would be cold.

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm not cold, but...

71
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,780
Go ahead. I'll head in.

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,430
Okay.

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,890
Wait, Noonim.

74
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,770
By chance...

75
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,240
were you concerned to hear about
 my meeting with Mr. Woo?

76
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,680
You were.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,350
I'm sorry for making you feel uneasy.

78
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,370
Oh, no. Why would you be sorry?

79
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,340
My goodness...

80
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,180
All I needed was to be excited 
by someone when I was younger.

81
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,350
At my age, there are so many
 things to be concerned about.

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,110
You're right.

83
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,380
But whether in my youth or now...

84
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,890
the unchanging fact is that...

85
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,600
I should be honest with my feelings.

86
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,690
Go ahead.

87
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,360
Go in now.

88
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,790
Joon Ah.

89
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,090
Where are you coming from?

90
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,490
Yes, Mom. Well...

91
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,180
CEO.

92
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,860
Hello.

93
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,800
Hae Deun.

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,440
What are you doing here
 this late, Hae Deun?

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,720
Were you with Hae Deun?

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,140
Yes.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,320
So...

98
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,100
what is it that you want to 
talk about at this hour?

99
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,550
We could talk in the office tomorrow.

100
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,940
This is an extremely urgent matter.

101
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,780
CEO. No...

102
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,370
Mother.

103
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,940
Mother?

104
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,450
You're Joon Ah's mother.

105
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,000
Mother, please approve our relationship.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
Hae Deun.

107
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,240
Didn't we tentatively agree
 to think it over time?

108
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,150
Yes, we did, but...

109
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,210
we couldn't bear to give it more time.

110
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,810
Why not?

111
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,620
Well, I guess...

112
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,990
Mom, we love each other so much.

113
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,150
We miss each other so much, Mom.

114
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,360
To be apart while thinking...

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,430
It's so hard for us, and we're tormented.

116
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,430
My gosh!

117
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,220
You can see each other at work. 
While working together.

118
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,040
We tend to set clear boundaries 
with work and personal matters.

119
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,650
Mom, I'm suffering so much, and...

120
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,440
I had no appetite today. I only ate
 half of an apple all day.

121
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,040
You, too, Mr. Makjang?

122
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,990
Me, too. I only ate two tangerines.

123
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,050
Really? You only got to 
eat two tangerines?

124
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,280
Oh, no...

125
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,760
Ms. Joo!

126
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,300
Bring us some snacks.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,110
Yes, CEO. What would you like?

128
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,420
No, it's okay, Ms. Joo.

129
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,050
I don't eat late-night snacks.

130
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,460
I tend to swell.

131
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,280
- You do swell when you eat.
- Yeah, right.

132
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,470
That's not important here.

133
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,880
Mother, please let us see each other.

134
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,970
I'll be really good. I'll try hard.

135
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,770
Mom, please let us continue our love.

136
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,160
I can't stand it...

137
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't live, Mom.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,570
Jang Joon Ah.

139
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,820
What's the matter with you?

140
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,100
Mom! Mom!

141
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,940
Mom...

142
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,790
Joon Ah.

143
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,630
Am I really your mom?

144
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,000
Of course, you're my mom.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
No.

146
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,850
You say that, but...

147
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,840
I don't think I ever was 
your mom in your heart.

148
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,910
That's why you lived away
 from home all this time

149
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,030
and want to move out as soon 
as Hae Deun got here tonight.

150
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,240
I'm extremely sad about it.

151
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,230
Mom, that's not it.

152
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,770
I'm really having a hard time, Mom.

153
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,660
I'm having a hard time, too.

154
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,900
You guys only think about your 
struggles in your love life.

155
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Why don't you even consider
 my suffering and sadness

156
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,420
because of you both?

157
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,110
Because I'm your stepmom,

158
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,500
I have purposely agreed 
with you many times

159
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,310
to respect your wishes.

160
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,470
You went along even though
 you didn't want to?

161
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,220
Yeah.

162
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,880
But...

163
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,040
I think that distanced us
 further ultimately.

164
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,940
- Hae Deun.
- Yes.

165
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,820
I heard you didn't eat anything.

166
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,370
Have some of this.

167
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,660
Oh, thank you.

168
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,860
Gosh, how come they're
 talking for so long?

169
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm hungry.

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,710
Would I look bad if I eat it now?

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,400
Should I eat just one?

172
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,240
Lee Hae Deun.

173
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,430
Hae Deun.

174
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,610
Na Ro oppa...

175
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,130
What brings you here to 
my house, Lee Hae Deun?

176
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,400
I came to get Joon Ah.

177
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,390
Is he a baby?

178
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,900
Did he break a bone or something?

179
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,100
Seo Ah, I'll set this in your room.

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,470
Does he already go in and 
out of your bedroom?

181
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,680
Yeah.

182
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,290
We're going to get married soon.

183
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,010
Whoa. Did the CEO approve?

184
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,290
I don't think so.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,660
You worry about yourself.

186
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,260
Director, tell me honestly.

187
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,660
My brother-in-law. 
Mr. Woo dumped you,

188
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,370
so you're dating Na Ro oppa 
out of anger, huh?

189
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,890
Look at you!

190
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,830
Seo Ah, I told you not to do this.

191
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,150
I was going to support them, 
yet she's climbing on top of my head!

192
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,430
Climb?

193
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,310
Are you a rock wall for me to
 climb on or something?

194
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,880
Seo Ah. Hae Deun.

195
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,920
Stop this, you two.

196
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,720
We want to side with you and Joon Ah.

197
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,270
Don't do this. Okay?

198
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,750
You shouldn't be like this, either, Oppa.

199
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,480
When you used to live at Samgwang Villa, 
you had your heart on my sister.

200
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,040
Are you going for the second choice
 since you failed at your first choice?

201
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,310
Hae Deun, when did I...

202
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,040
See? He's stunned.

203
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,590
Na Ro, did you really do that?

204
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,740
- I'm telling you it's true.
- No, Seo Ah.

205
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,200
Hae Deun, why are you joking like that?

206
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,690
- Geez...
- I'm not joking.

207
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,670
Hey...

208
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,970
What are you doing here, Hwang Na Ro?

209
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,100
Director had too many documents 
to carry. So I came in with her.

210
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,550
Hae Deun, I'll take you home. Let's go.

211
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,950
Take me home?

212
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,420
Then are you coming back 
here afterward?

213
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,710
Huh?

214
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,830
I told him to do that.

215
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,410
And I'll say this since 
two of you are here.

216
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,560
I don't like the two of you.

217
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,800
From now on...

218
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,090
stop going in and out of my house.

219
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,160
Mom...

220
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,120
And Joon Ah and Seo Ah.

221
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,990
Because you two like these people,

222
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,670
I'll try to be open about them.

223
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,210
So wait until then.

224
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,490
If you two genuinely consider 
me to be your mom.

225
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,390
Goodbye, Hae Deun and Na Ro.

226
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,600
Mom...

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,320
Geez...

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,250
Because Lee Hae Deun is here,

229
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,050
Na Ro was also told not to 
come into the house.

230
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,320
Hey, be quiet.

231
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,950
- Let's go. I'll take you home.
- Forget it.

232
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Hae Deun.

233
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,620
Director Lee.

234
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,560
So...

235
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,860
you couldn't participate in the finals?

236
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,290
Yes.

237
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,910
Gosh, no wonder.

238
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,950
I was listening to the radio
 while working today.

239
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,130
You didn't come on. I was so 
shocked and worried.

240
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,590
I called you, but you wouldn't answer.

241
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,340
I'm sorry, Noonim.

242
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,250
I promised you that I'd win 
the month-end finals.

243
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,280
I mean, keeping the promise is one thing.

244
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,800
How could it compare to
 your disappointment?

245
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,190
Gosh, why did that ahjumma
 have to get sick then...

246
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,640
I also did see that ahjumma

247
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,790
while passing by the jokbal place.

248
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,780
I shouldn't say this about 
someone who is sick.

249
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,300
She really didn't have anyone else?

250
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,480
Yes.

251
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,770
Eun Ji isn't married.

252
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,500
She was taking care of her ill parents

253
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,410
and have been living alone 
after they passed away.

254
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,420
Aigoo, I see.

255
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,660
I thought she was a young mom.

256
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,170
Unni, I'm home.

257
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,040
Hi, you're home, Man Jung.

258
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,290
You went through a lot earlier, huh?

259
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,280
I heard you went to the hospital?

260
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,760
Yeah.

261
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,850
- I'll go up.
- Oh, okay.

262
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,000
Man Jung.

263
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,380
Man Jung... I looked into it...

264
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,650
and it turns out there's 
another singing competition.

265
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,810
So I signed up for that right away.

266
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,270
I'll work really hard again this time...

267
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,820
and I'll get into that...

268
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,250
She has no family. I just couldn't...

269
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,040
I felt so bad to leave
 a sick person behind.

270
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,350
So...

271
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,170
Right.

272
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,810
You gave up working for
 a general hospital for me,

273
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,940
and you're staying by my side. I'm...

274
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm really sorry.

275
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,500
I'll work really hard and...

276
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,360
for the upcoming singing contest...

277
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,590
I have...

278
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,450
I have nothing to say even if 
I had ten mouths to speak.

279
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,270
I have nothing to say.

280
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,600
I'm really sorry, Man Jung.

281
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,460
Why... why did I do that?

282
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,620
I could've asked someone for help...

283
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,770
Right. I could've just called 911 
and have them take her.

284
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,000
Why did I go myself?

285
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,550
That's where it went wrong. Oh!

286
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,460
Just like you used to say,

287
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,190
if I had worked out my legs, I could've...

288
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,370
I could've run and taken her to the 
hospital and run to participate...

289
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,520
I'm sorry, Man Jung.

290
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,470
You wanted it. You wanted it so much.

291
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,520
I just ruined it all. I'm sorry.

292
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,950
Okay.

293
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,820
Here's a quiz.

294
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,950
My one and only love. My first love.

295
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,790
Who is my last love?

296
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,120
The answer is Lee Man Jung. 
Ding-dong-dang! Pass!

297
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,300
I'm sorry, Man Jung.

298
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,000
Let me hit you.

299
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,570
Hae Deun! Director Lee!

300
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,220
Why do you walk so fast?

301
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,250
Why did you follow me?

302
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm not following.

303
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,820
I want to walk you home.

304
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,350
Go back now.

305
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,110
Hae Deun...

306
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,350
What are you most angry about now?

307
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,580
That you're a mama's boy.

308
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,830
What?

309
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,150
Mama's...

310
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm a mama's boy?

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,640
Wow, I can't believe you're
 calling me a mama's boy.

312
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,260
Wow, my mom would be 
so happy to hear this.

313
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,660
I mustered up the courage 
and went there.

314
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,500
Gosh, I know. I'm so grateful 
for your courage.

315
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,840
I was so touched.

316
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,130
I came here because
 I missed you so much.

317
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,350
- And?
- And...

318
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,570
After listening to my mom,

319
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,580
I couldn't come back here that easily.

320
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,010
Of course, I really want to 
come back here.

321
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,610
I'm uncomfortable at home, 
with Seo Ah,

322
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,180
and with my mom. 
That's still the same.

323
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,710
But my mom...

324
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,870
My mom said this earlier.

325
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,020
She feels like I don't consider
 her as my mom.

326
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,590
When I heard that,

327
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,130
I felt guilty.

328
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,330
Hae Deun.

329
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,190
To be honest, I actually thought that.

330
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,630
Well, I guess it was justified.

331
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,260
CEO is pretty cold.

332
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,670
No.

333
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,550
My mom may seem cold
 on the outside, but

334
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,130
she loves Seo Ah and me very much.

335
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,070
I know that, and so does Seo Ah.

336
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,370
Then how about me? 
I'm disappointed, too.

337
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,070
In any case, I lost.

338
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,990
I really had to muster up the courage.

339
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
Hae Deun.

340
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,920
Could you lose just this once?

341
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,430
Never mind everything else.

342
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,180
Don't think of anyone else. 
Just lose this for me.

343
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,100
Then I'll change my mom's mind,

344
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,060
and I'll get her approval.

345
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,800
Could you just trust me on this?

346
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,720
I'll never disappoint you, 
ever again, Hae Deun.

347
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,120
Come on, feel better.

348
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,610
Lee Hae Deun!

349
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,710
Hae Deun.

350
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,270
You! Where did you go?

351
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,300
Oh, Joon Ah.

352
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,320
By chance, did you go over 
to the CEO's house?

353
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,860
- Yeah.
- Gosh, what's wrong with you?

354
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,120
Why don't you listen to me? 
What are you doing?

355
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,490
Mother, I'm sorry.

356
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,460
Please hit me instead. I'm sorry.

357
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,450
But why are you  back here, Joon Ah?

358
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,430
Why?

359
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,010
I just came to bring Hae Deun home.

360
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,960
- I'll go back.
- Bye.

361
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,470
Hae Deun.

362
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,620
Wait...

363
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,140
The CEO said that?

364
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,680
Yeah. She said she doesn't like me.

365
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,960
My gosh, CEO...

366
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,600
What doesn't she like 
about my Hae Deun?

367
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,440
The problem is the family
 tree getting tangled.

368
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,880
I don't like the CEO, either, but...

369
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,560
how could she say that to my face?
 I'm Unni's younger sister.

370
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,670
After all she did to us before?

371
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,550
So why did you go there 
at this late hour?

372
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,250
You didn't listen to me and went there

373
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,790
to be treated like that?

374
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,260
Because I missed him.

375
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,640
Oh, my goodness...

376
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,930
Gosh...

377
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,460
Aigoo, seriously.

378
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,360
Good morning.

379
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,930
Lee Hae Deun.

380
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,410
Hi, Unni.

381
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,590
Why are you so down?

382
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,400
Is Mom sick by chance?

383
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,270
No.

384
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,830
Is it because of Joon Ah?

385
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,250
Why? Did something happen?

386
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,830
Unni, I really don't like the CEO.

387
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,420
What now?

388
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,140
Because she doesn't approve
 of your relationship?

389
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,580
It's understandable from 
Mom's perspective.

390
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,110
No, that's not it.

391
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,270
CEO dislikes me to my face.

392
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,740
Lee Hae Deun!

393
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,220
What do you mean...

394
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,530
I dislike you to your face?

395
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,800
Well, it seemed that way...

396
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,310
 Hello! 

397
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,050
Unni, the way I see it...

398
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,700
CEO isn't your birth mom.

399
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,400
- I think she's Jang Seo Ah's birth mom.
- Lee Hae Deun.

400
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,760
Good morning.

401
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,930
Geez, I feel like school bullies are 
giving me the stink eye.

402
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,630
There are more bullies.

403
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,290
See? Look at that.

404
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,440
Jang Joon Ah is such a mama's boy.

405
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,700
Gosh, CEO...

406
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,630
If Hae Deun came over to 
her house that late,

407
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,220
she should oblige as an 
elder and give in.

408
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,860
Gosh, Hae Deun and CEO are 
so similar in some respect.

409
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,900
People would think that Hae Deun is

410
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,920
her real daughter, not Chae Woon.

411
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,020
- Gosh, this is so upsetting.
- Unni!

412
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,080
What? Did Hae Deun find
 her birth mom?

413
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,070
Gosh, no. That's not it.

414
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,680
Aren't you going to work?

415
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,420
It's not?

416
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,320
It's not. Stop rambling.

417
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,940
I work this evening shift.

418
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,890
- Unni.
- Huh?

419
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,900
How do you make porridge?

420
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,250
Porridge? Why?

421
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,140
Well, that Eun Ji...

422
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,500
- Hwak Se's hometown friend.
- Yeah?

423
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,730
Eun Ji is hospitalized right now.

424
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,010
She has no one.

425
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,530
So I wanted to take her some porridge.

426
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,990
So you're not mad anymore?

427
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,250
What did I do?

428
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,910
I guess you really love Hwak Se.

429
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,940
You even thought of making porridge.

430
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,040
I do love him.

431
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,360
- Aigoo.
- How do you make it? Tell me.

432
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,300
All right. Soak the rice in the water...

433
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,070
- Just a minute.
- You got a call.

434
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,090
 

435
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,700
Isn't that the orphanage
 you used to work at?

436
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,200
Yeah.

437
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,700
Soak the rice in water first.

438
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,970
Soak it?

439
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,010
Yes, Director.

440
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,820
How have you been?

441
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,800
I've been out of touch. I'm so sorry.

442
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,500
You're staying healthy, right?

443
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,190
Pardon?

444
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,970
 Ms. Kim Eun Ji... 

445
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,150
 She said she'll look for you, Soon Jung. 

446
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,540
Well? No one with that name 
came to see me.

447
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,360
This much rice?

448
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,150
Why would she look for me?

449
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,350
Excuse me?

450
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,030
 I think Kim Eun Ji is... 

451
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,580
 Ra Hoon's birth mother. 

452
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,950
Well, um...

453
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,470
Unni, what do I do next?

454
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,540
Yes. Yes, Director.

455
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,150
Yes...

456
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,030
Bye now.

457
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,680
Unni, what? What's wrong?

458
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,610
Is something the matter 
at the orphanage?

459
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,510
No, no.

460
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,120
Hey...

461
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,380
- Man Jung.
- Huh?

462
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,770
Well...

463
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,130
- Hwak Se's...
- Yeah?

464
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,040
That hometown friend of his.

465
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,120
Yeah.

466
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,730
What did you say her name is?

467
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,000
Eun Ji.

468
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Kim Eun Ji or something 
like that. Eun Ji. Why?

469
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,350
Eun Ji?

470
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,630
Yeah.

471
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,070
Why?

472
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,840
Calm down...

473
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,110
Yeah, this has happened 
many times before.

474
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,540
Yeah.

475
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,500
Wait a minute.

476
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,460
Unni...

477
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,890
Why did you want to come? 
I know you're busy.

478
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,450
Gosh...

479
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,000
Since she's Hwak Se's hometown friend...

480
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,290
I just want to take care of her, too.

481
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,320
Is it here?
 

482
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,440
Kim Eun Ji. It's Kim Eun Ji. Wait.

483
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
Unni, give me a minute.

484
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,070
Oh-ho. It's the hospital.

485
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,170
Unni, it's an urgent call. 
Wait just a moment.

486
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,600
Hello?

487
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,470
Hello.

488
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,510
- Hi.
- I...

489
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,950
live in the same villa as Hwak Se.

490
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,790
I'm Lee Soon Jung.

491
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,590
Hello.

492
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,000
Hwak Se is at work right now.

493
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,320
I came here with my sister.

494
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,990
Thank you for coming.

495
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,900
No, don't do this.

496
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,850
Just lean back comfortably.

497
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,620
Are you feeling better?

498
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,620
I'm fine.

499
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,240
Well...

500
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,230
I...

501
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,580
received a call from Director Choi

502
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,710
of Sunny Orphanage this morning.

503
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,190
By chance...

504
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,200
are you here to meet Ra Hoon?

505
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,330
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,790
Gosh...

507
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,300
Then...

508
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,940
are you really...

509
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,750
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

510
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,280
At the time,

511
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,470
two boys who were Ra Hoon's age
 came to the orphanage.

512
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,970
One of them got adopted overseas.

513
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,180
So I'm here to meet Ra Hoon first.

514
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,260
But why?

515
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,820
Gosh, no. I'm sorry.

516
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,750
I'm sure you came because
 you missed Ra Hoon.

517
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,910
I couldn't help myself. I'm so sorry.

518
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,030
No.

519
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,090
I'm...

520
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,770
I'm too ashamed.

521
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,300
I couldn't bear to meet you.

522
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,720
I'm sorry.

523
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,180
Unni, you came in first.

524
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,000
Hello, I met you last time.

525
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,350
Hwak Se was so worried about you.

526
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,570
I brought you some porridge.

527
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,190
I heard.

528
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,470
Hello.

529
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,770
Yes...

530
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,090
I mean, well...

531
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,930
the doctor here is my hoobae.

532
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,410
I'm a doctor, too.

533
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,140
He said your abdominal pain
 is stress-induced.

534
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,950
Yes.

535
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,220
Yeah...

536
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,150
He said you're very weak.

537
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,830
Please have some porridge. 
You have to eat lots of food.

538
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,140
Thank you.

539
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,580
Unni.

540
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,940
There's something, huh?

541
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,180
What did you talk about?

542
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,120
What did you talk about with her? 
About Hwak Se?

543
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,800
Gosh, what could we be talking about?

544
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,380
Let's hurry home.

545
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,810
You have to get to work, too.

546
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,550
Unni.

547
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,610
The flower pose?

548
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,850
Hey, Ba Reun, it came out so good.

549
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,130
- Right?
- Yeah.

550
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,870
You said you'll put this up
 in your cubby.

551
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,950
Yeah, I heard everyone 
puts these up nowadays.

552
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,260
Wow...

553
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,480
I think my girlfriend will 
be the prettiest one.

554
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,100
Hey, your military life will be 
easier, thanks to me.

555
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,400
Thank you.

556
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,890
Okay, the next stop is?

557
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,450
Take pictures at the spot 
we met for the first time.

558
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,280
Sounds great!

559
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,270
 Let's go! 

560
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,620
Get back to work.

561
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,770
Please be sure to check everything
 regarding building this factory

562
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,830
and make sure things go smoothly.

563
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,080
Dad, why are you doing this?

564
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,290
What about?

565
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,560
Why do you keep trying to 
push Mom away?

566
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,940
You're even saying you're dating someone.

567
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,970
What do you mean I'm pushing her away?

568
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,830
I'm saying that because I am dating.

569
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,490
If you feel bad toward Mom 
about the past,

570
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,480
just be cool about it and 
apologize to her...

571
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,270
Would apology suffice?

572
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,710
The tie has been broken. 
The milk has been spilled.

573
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,230
Could you put things back together?

574
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,150
Gosh, that couldn't be.

575
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,030
Did Mom say that to you?

576
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,280
I don't think so.

577
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,090
If you think that, you'll be
 the one getting upset.

578
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,600
That's what you think.

579
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,340
Dad.

580
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,640
Trying to push Mom away...

581
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,250
That's not your true feelings, right?

582
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,570
Look at you.

583
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,460
I mean it, man.

584
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,920
Nah...

585
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,230
I think you'll regret this in the end.

586
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,500
I won't regret it. Get to work.

587
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,720
Gosh, it's a tough situation 
as your child.

588
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,290
For me to get more involved,

589
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,370
I feel like I'm not being 
cautious and butting in.

590
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,710
But I still want to understand where
 you and Mom are coming from.

591
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,720
All right. I'll get going, Dad.

592
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,960
Have a good day, Dad.

593
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,230
Was he always so thoughtful?

594
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,890
Geez, he seems more like a friend now.

595
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,430
Yes...

596
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,450
It's not for sure yet.

597
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,990
I'll just have to be patient and wait.

598
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,660
Mom!

599
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,240
Hi, Ra Hoon.

600
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,860
Did you go somewhere?

601
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,040
Yeah.

602
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,350
I had a matter to attend to.

603
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,580
Where is Ba Reun?

604
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,270
She went to do her modeling gig.

605
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,200
I stopped by just before going to work.

606
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,980
Because I wanted to
 eat your food for lunch.

607
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,200
You did?

608
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm glad you came.

609
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,880
What should I make for you, my son?

610
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,280
I love everything you make, Mom.

611
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,440
I like whatever you make.

612
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,670
- Really?
- Yes.

613
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,860
Aigoo...

614
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,450
Let's go in.

615
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,390
- But what specifically?
- Really. I like everything.

616
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,870
Use your spoon to eat it up.

617
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,900
- Okay.
- Put the rice in your soup.

618
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,350
- Is it good?
- It's so tasty.

619
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,880
It's so tasty?

620
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,000
Eat a lot.

621
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,400
Ma'am.

622
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,450
As for this matter...

623
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,050
please keep this between you and me.

624
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,800
If things turn out that we're not related,

625
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,790
Ra Hoon...

626
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,310
Ra Hoon will get...

627
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,120
hurt too much.

628
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,350
I'm too ashamed to face Ra Hoon.

629
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,140
I'm so sorry.

630
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:15,000
 I'm glad she came to see him 
before Ra Hoon goes to the military. 

631
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,890
 It would be nice if she's his birth mom. 

632
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,410
Does it taste okay?

633
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,890
It's so good.

634
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,710
Ra Hoon, you like perilla leaves, right?

635
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,280
Eat with this.

636
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,370
Here.

637
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,280
Okay, wrap it and...

638
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,880
put another piece of meat.

639
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,610
- Eat a lot.
- Okay.

640
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,340
 

641
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,250
Yes.

642
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,800
Brother-in-law.

643
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,100
What, Director Jung?

644
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,400
You have a guest.

645
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,990
A guest?

646
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,470
Ms. Jung Min Jae.

647
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,620
Hot...

648
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,650
What... what?

649
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,170
It's a lie, right?

650
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,670
What?

651
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,170
That.

652
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,780
That.

653
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,330
That there's a lady I'm dating?

654
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,680
It's a lie, right?

655
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,420
It's not a lie. It's true.

656
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,800
Then let me meet the woman 
you're dating.

657
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,090
Why?

658
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,260
Why would you meet that woman?

659
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,890
You and I are strangers now.

660
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,690
You met Professor Son, though.

661
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,620
I didn't meet him intentionally.

662
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,570
We happened to bump into 
each other here and there.

663
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,470
If I tell her, "My ex-wife would 
like to meet you."

664
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,720
Don't you think she'll be shocked?

665
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,740
Then give me some evidence.

666
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,500
A photo taken together or something.

667
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,350
I'll believe you if you give me proof.

668
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
What proof?

669
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,200
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

670
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,830
As for me, it's okay if I don't believe you.

671
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,030
But you threw a bomb at your son 
and your daughter-in-law last night.

672
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,550
What will you do now?

673
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,140
Are you going to say, "It was a lie"?

674
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,140
And unless you give me proof,

675
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,360
I won't date Professor Son.

676
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,420
Wh...

677
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,950
Why not?

678
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,600
I have to make sure you have a girlfriend

679
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,150
for me to be at ease and move on.

680
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,990
Fine.

681
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,480
All right then.

682
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,220
I'll provide proof.

683
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,860
 What the heck, Woo Jung Hoo? 

684
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,640
 Could it true? 

685
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,350
Jung Hoo is dating someone?

686
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,960
Oh? It's news to me.

687
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,330
He only goes to his office
 and the jokbal place.

688
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,870
When would he date someone?

689
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,320
That's what I mean.

690
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,460
Why don't you keep an eye 
on him and let me know?

691
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,640
Noona, by chance...

692
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,620
do you still have feelings for him?

693
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,550
No, it's not like that!

694
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,980
I don't!

695
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,490
Why is she getting mad at me?

696
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,710
 

697
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,470
 

698
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,330
James. Oh, my.

699
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,110
He started doing this stuff?

700
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,350
 

701
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,800
Oh, my.

702
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,050
My goodness.

703
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,980
Look at him...

704
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,910
I can tell at a glance that it's fake.

705
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,720
Why is Jung Hoo doing this?

706
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,670
Too sweet.

707
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,600
Geez...

708
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,860
I can't eat anymore. I'm full.

709
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,300
Geez.

710
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,470
Aigoo, you sure are trying hard.

711
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,160
 Seo Ah. 

712
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,810
 Hello, Seo Ah. 

713
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,290
 I'm Na Ro's friend. 

714
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,270
Na Ro.

715
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,090
You know the guy who 
came to your place?

716
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,250
Did he call you?

717
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,830
No, he hasn't.

718
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,010
Seo Ah, don't worry too much.

719
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,470
I'll take care of it.

720
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,630
Don't worry too much about that incident.

721
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,090
 Just find out if Hwang Na Ro is 

722
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,370
 plotting something shady. 

723
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,710
Geez, Seo Yeon asked me 
a favor for the first time.

724
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,810
I should do a good job with it.

725
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,600
Why isn't this Prof. Kim calling me?

726
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,280
 

727
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,600
This jerk...

728
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,690
Speaking of the devil.

729
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,160
Come on, Hyungnim.

730
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,530
You told me to scare Hwang Na Ro.

731
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,110
Now you want me to stop?

732
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,610
That's right, man.

733
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,070
It's not because I like him.
 I feel sorry for him.

734
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,070
Besides, I heard he gave 
you some money.

735
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,220
Just stop right around now.

736
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,500
I can't do that.

737
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,800
Look at you. Aren't you going
 to listen to this hyungnim?

738
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,730
You're being rebellious.

739
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,610
Hyungnim, don't be delusional.

740
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,230
I'm not listening to you
 to make my moves.

741
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,450
What, man? Let go! Let go!

742
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,610
That Hwang Na Ro!
 If he doesn't treat me right,

743
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,590
Kim Jung Won, Jang Seo Ah, and 
even your daughter Bit Chae Woon...

744
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,080
S***. I can destroy them all.

745
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,670
What? My Seo Yeon? You a**hole...

746
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,100
So...

747
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,520
you just stay put, Hyungnim.

748
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,400
Hyungnim, you're a toothless tiger now!

749
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,700
How dare you call me out when I'm busy?

750
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,150
Hey, man! Prof. Kim!

751
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,750
That jerk...

752
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,960
Geez.

753
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,170
This Park Pil Hong is powerless now.

754
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,080
I have to help out my Seo Yeon.

755
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,350
 Why are you closing your eyes? 

756
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,260
 Why close your eyes? To do what? 

757
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,810
Oh, I have to pick up my clothes.

758
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,410
 

759
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,530
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

760
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,980
You're the customer from yesterday.

761
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

762
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,100
Okay, I fixed it. Here you go.

763
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,380
I wonder if you'll like it.

764
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,560
Whoa! It looks as good as new!

765
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,100
Sir, it's daebak.

766
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,300
And...

767
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,920
it's our grand opening gift.

768
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,850
Really?

769
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,390
- Whoa!
- I made it myself.

770
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,630
It's so cute!

771
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,080
My sister has one just like this. 
Thank you!

772
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,330
Oh, really?

773
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,750
How much do I owe you?

774
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,880
For my grand opening,

775
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,660
your first repair is free.

776
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,990
Really?

777
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,220
Along with this gift?

778
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,110
Daebak. I'll come back often.

779
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,760
- Bye.
- Good night!

780
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,120
Aigoo.

781
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,120
To see my Seo Yeon's sister be so happy...

782
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920
makes me happy.

783
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,810
Welcome.

784
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,470
You're surprised to see me here, huh?

785
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,010
Oh, no.

786
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,580
Oh, my. Were you making kimchi?

787
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,280
Yes, some geotjori.

788
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,490
I see.

789
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,920
To give to Seo Yeon?

790
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,730
Is Seo Yeon coming over later?

791
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,500
Yes.

792
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,450
Gosh, even though I'm her mom,

793
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,040
I can't do stuff like this for her.

794
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,280
Gosh, don't say that.

795
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,480
Chae Woon respects you so much, CEO.

796
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,870
It looks delicious.

797
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,890
Gosh, why did the CEO come over again?

798
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,870
I was in the mood, so I wanted
 to come home early to rest.

799
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,840
It's cold.

800
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,790
I can't get caught. I have to 
pack quickly and leave.

801
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,430
 Yes, Chief Yoon. 

802
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,390
 Ah, yes. 

803
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,470
 - Really? 
- What am I doing?

804
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,580
 I thought so. 

805
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,110
 Yes. 

806
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,070
Then I'll retake the photo in
 the morning and send it to you.

807
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,550
Yes.

808
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,010
My gosh...

809
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,830
I had no idea being in love 
would be so difficult.

810
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,900
Right, Makjang?

811
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,270
Why is your neck crooked?

812
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,200
You look like him.

813
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,070
 How is my Director Lee so pretty
 even when she's asleep? 

814
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:20,690
 Aigoo, so pretty... 

815
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,380
I'll stay here like this for ten minutes.

816
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,100
Don't come out, Soon Jung.

817
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,300
Gosh, it'd be nice to stay longer...

818
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,270
and see Seo Yeon later.

819
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,920
But I have something planned tonight.

820
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
Yes.

821
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,620
Take some geojori with you.

822
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,010
Oh, no.

823
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,740
I feel like I'm taking away 
Seo Yeon's portion. I feel bad.

824
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,800
I have some for Chae Woon.

825
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,600
- Thanks, Soon Jung.
- Sure.

826
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,710
- I'm off.
- Okay.

827
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,010
Since I'm here, I'll take some
 of Joon Ah's clothes.

828
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,090
He doesn't have too many 
clothes at home.

829
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,770
Sure, do that.

830
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,330
I'll open the door for you.

831
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,810
Oh, my!

832
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,050
My gosh.

833
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,570
What's going on?

834
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,960
Soon Jung.

835
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,610
Mom!

836
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,800
Mom...

837
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,650
Hey!

838
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,820
Gosh, seriously.

839
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,290
- You, come out.
- Yes, ma'am.

840
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,660
Hey...

841
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,880
Gosh, Hae Deun...

842
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,210
No, Mom...

843
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,380
- Mr. Makjang.
- Director Lee.

844
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,350
Hey, hurry up and come out.

845
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,370
- Director Lee!
- CEO!

846
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,540
Mom!

847
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,940
Mom, Mom...

848
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,390
Hae Deun!

849
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:23,810
Come to your senses!

850
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,910
- It's not like that.
- Really!

851
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,850
- Hurry up and come out! Hurry up!
- Mom! Mom...

852
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,470
Mom! Mom!

853
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,220
- We're leaving, Soon Jung.
- Okay.

854
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,740
- Hurry up and go.
- Geez, I think I'm bleeding.

855
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,710
- Mr. Makjang!
- Hae Deun!

856
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,310
- Hae Deun!
- Director Lee! Director Lee!

857
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,130
- Director Lee!
- Mr. Makjang!

858
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,330
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

859
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,110
What are you doing?

860
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,300
Gosh, come on!

861
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,190
My bag...

862
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,050
- It hurts!
- What's with you?

863
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,630
I just wanted to hold her hand once.

864
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:59,290
♫   It's good! It's good! It's good!   ♫

866
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,110
- Hwak Se.
- Yes?

867
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,620
I like that song the more I hear it.

868
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,030
Right, Eems hyung?

Hello.

871
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,830
Hey, Eun Ji.

872
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,510
You should get more rest. 
Why did you come?

873
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,450
Hey, Eun Ji, shouldn't you be 
in the hospital longer?

874
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,000
I'm okay now.

875
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,990
I'm sorry I couldn't work yesterday.

876
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,390
Gosh, don't even mention it.

877
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:30,000
Take good care of your health.

878
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,600
Thank you.

879
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,000
Yes...

880
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,190
I'm sorry, Oppa.

881
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,870
You were supposed to be 
at the singing contest.

882
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,710
But you couldn't participate 
because of me.

883
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,170
It's okay.

884
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,180
It's okay. I'll have many more chances.

885
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,920
I'm really fine.

886
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,340
I heard Jjung-a brought you 
some delicious porridge.

887
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,100
Yes. Ms. Lee came with her.

888
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,450
Soon Jung noonim, too?

889
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,180
- Yes.
- Hello!

890
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,480
- Hello.
- Hello!

891
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,250
- Hello!
- Ra Hoon and Ba Reun.

892
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,710
Ra Hoon. Ba Reun.

893
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,880
Did you just get off work?

894
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

895
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,670
Mom asked me to get the
 food containers from you.

896
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,290
Food containers?

897
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,730
Oh, the empty containers?

898
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,220
I could've brought them
 home after work.

899
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,450
Why did Noonim ask you to do that?

900
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,780
I'll introduce you to 
a new employee here.

901
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,440
She's my hometown friend.

902
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,740
And I happened to meet her 
right here. Eun...

903
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,410
Ra Hoon and Ba Reun.

904
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:35,870
Eat some jokbal since you're here.

905
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,320
- It's on me.
- Could we?

906
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,290
No, thank you.

907
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,220
You treated us last time. 
You don't have to today.

908
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,060
Geez, sit over here. Sit down.

909
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,720
- Sit.
- Sit down.

910
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,860
I was starving. This is so great.

911
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,550
Thank goodness we ran
 into James ahjussi.

912
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,800
Yeah.

913
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,870
Thank you.

914
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,740
I heard you're Uncle Hwak Se's 
hometown friend.

915
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,190
- Yes.
- Hello, I'm Lee Ra Hoon.

916
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,960
Hi.

917
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,180
I'm Ba Reun. Cha Ba Reun.

918
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,670
Yes. Enjoy.

919
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,360
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

920
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,590
James ahjussi, thank you for the meal.

921
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,100
Sure. Eat a lot.

922
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,680
- Thank you!
- Sure.

923
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,010
- Eat a lot.
- You, too.

924
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,100
Eun Ji?

925
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,140
Oh, yeah.

926
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,540
I'm home!

927
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,990
We're home.

928
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,540
Rough day, huh, my son and daughter.

929
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,090
Thank you.

930
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,290
- You worked hard.
- I got the containers from the jokbal place.

931
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,220
Oh, really?

932
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,650
James ahjussi convinced us
 to eat jokbal there.

933
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,250
We ate some and brought some home.

934
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,350
Aigoo, good job.

935
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,040
It'd be nice to eat this for dinner.

936
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,670
Mom, we noticed that there was 
a new employee at the jokbal place.

937
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,230
Oh, I heard she's Uncle Hwak Se's 
hometown friend.

938
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,900
Oh, is that so?

939
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,400
She made such a nice 
first impression, huh?

940
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,940
Yes, Chief Yoon.

941
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,640
Through email?

942
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,440
She has a nice impression?

943
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,650
Yes.

944
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,190
But she kept staring at me.

945
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,480
- Did she?
- Yes.

946
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,300
Aigoo. Gosh, of course. My son...

947
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,110
You have good looks that make everyone 
turn around walking down the street.

948
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:42,430
Right?

949
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,730
I do have good looks since
 I take after you, Mom.

950
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,180
Of course.

951
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,280
I'll go up now.

952
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,010
Ra Hoon.

953
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,210
My gosh...

954
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,590
You want to hug me a lot before 
I leave for the military, huh?

955
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,270
Yeah.

956
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,540
I feel sad already doing this.

957
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,540
My goodness...

958
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:25,190
You didn't have to come over.

959
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,820
I feel bad.

960
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,970
I saw that you had a leak last time.

961
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,470
How can I just leave it?

962
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,340
Jae Hee, thanks.

963
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,140
I ordered some jokbal because
 I'm so grateful to you.

964
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,790
- Eat before you go.
- Jokbal sounds good...

965
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,770
From where? The one in the front?

966
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:39,930
Yeah.

967
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,980
My dad could be delivering.

968
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,820
Your jokbal is here!

969
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,890
Aigoo.

970
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,090
Aigoo, I can't believe you 
brought it, In-law.

971
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,600
Excuse me?

972
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,550
Oh, well...

973
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,780
You look just like my in-law.

974
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,750
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

975
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,340
Hey, Woo Jae Hee.

976
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,290
Oh, Dad!

977
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,450
What brings you here?

978
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,770
There was a leak up there.

979
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,270
I was fixing it for him.

980
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,220
Even still, what are you doing
 all the way here?

981
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,170
 

982
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,930
Father?

983
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,400
 Father! 

984
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,090
Hi, Chae Woon.

985
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,640
What are you doing there?

986
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,090
Oh, I was delivering some jokbal.

987
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,930
Going to your mother's?

988
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:40,870
Yes.

989
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,170
Mom said she has some geotjori for me.

990
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,450
Oh, my goodness.

991
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,060
I'm so grateful.

992
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,990
- Go ahead and see her.
- Okay.

993
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,340
Good evening.

994
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,570
I finally get to meet you.

995
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,030
I'm Woo Jung Hoo.

996
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,990
Yes, I'm Park Pil Hong.

997
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,760
I've seen you through photos.

998
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,760
Oh, I see.

999
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,350
That's why I told you that

1000
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,790
opening up a store here is a huge risk.

1001
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,190
Yes, I believe so.

1002
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:35,920
Opening up a store like
 this is very risky.

1003
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,130
Mom.

1004
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,930
Hi, Chae Woon. You're here.

1005
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,930
Aigoo.

1006
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:53,550
The CEO was here a little bit ago.

1007
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,820
Huh?

1008
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,100
Because of Joon Ah and Hae Deun?

1009
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,850
Yeah. Joon Ah was here, too.

1010
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,330
Joon Ah, too?

1011
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,100
Gosh, he had snuck in...

1012
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,790
as he was meeting with Hae Deun, 
and they got caught.

1013
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,910
The CEO and I were so shocked.

1014
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,170
Gosh, Lee Hae Deun, really.

1015
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:17,290
Gosh, they're like Romeo and Juliet.

1016
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,080
Is Hae Deun inside?

1017
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,900
Yeah. She's so angry.

1018
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,730
Gosh.

1019
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,110
Mom, I'll help.

1020
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,710
If my daughter-in-law finds out 
Park Pil Hong is there doing that,

1021
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,500
she'll be upset.

1022
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,900
Jung Min Jae, what's up now?

1023
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,380
Gosh, why are you doing this?

1024
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,280
Why do you keep putting on a show?

1025
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,420
A show?

1026
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,550
It's not a show.

1027
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,260
What do you mean it's not?

1028
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,750
You're putting on such a ridiculous show.

1029
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,030
This isn't going to work.

1030
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,380
I'll have to introduce you to her.

1031
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,490
Who? Your new girlfriend?

1032
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,000
 Yes! 

1033
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,010
Hey, Woo Jung Hoo!

1034
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,230
What?

1035
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,380
Why are you doing this?

1036
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,660
Do you feel bad about how poorly
 you treated me in the past?

1037
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,460
Even so, is this all you can do for me?

1038
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,230
Of course, I do feel terrible.

1039
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:54,120
I'd really like to compensate 
you for that also.

1040
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,830
And as it happens, a good man
 is there for you as well.

1041
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,690
It looks like you're excited
 about him, too, but

1042
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,330
you can't do anything about it.

1043
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,900
 That's why I'm encouraging you. 

1044
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,120
Whether I'm doing anything
 about it or not,

1045
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,290
why are you doing this?

1046
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,940
If you continue this, it seems like
 you still have feelings for me.

1047
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,450
If you still do, just say so.

1048
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,550
What... what do you mean 
I still have feelings for you?

1049
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:18,830
You left me saying you 
don't love me anymore.

1050
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,320
 To someone who thinks it's all over, 

1051
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,250
 how can I have lingering feelings? 

1052
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,050
Now, this is all I can do...

1053
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,680
for you. What could I do?

1054
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,560
I can't do...

1055
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,450
anything more than that.

1056
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,590
Because I'm ashamed.

1057
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,780
Lee Hae Deun.

1058
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,080
Unni...

1059
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,340
I heard you had another
 dramatic moment.

1060
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,610
Whatever.

1061
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,940
It's so hard to pursue a love 
that people are opposing.

1062
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,110
Then work on getting their approval.

1063
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,100
Don't be so down like this.

1064
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,830
What's this? It's cute.

1065
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:19,860
Right?

1066
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,260
The clothing repair shop owner gave 
it to me for the grand opening.

1067
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,890
They gave out a stuffed animal
 for the grand opening?

1068
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,750
Yeah.

1069
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,600
Isn't it similar to the one
 you hung on your purse?

1070
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,510
Yeah...

1071
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,810
It is.

1072
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,900
Look. It's been mended very nicely, too.

1073
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,380
Whoa, really.

1074
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,940
You can't tell at all.

1075
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,410
Where is that? Is it closeby?

1076
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:42,310
It's across from the jokbal place.

1077
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,750
That ahjussi said he made
 the stuffed animal himself.

1078
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,360
An ahjussi? Is it a man?

1079
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,410
Yeah.

1080
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,780
 Well, I enjoy sewing as you know. 

1081
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,750
 I sew at a clothing repair shop. 

1082
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,240
It's finished.

1083
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,910
You won't have any leaks
 from the ceiling.

1084
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,800
Okay, thanks, Jae Hee.

1085
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,330
What's wrong? Are you worried 
about something?

1086
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,930
No, just because.

1087
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,340
I'm just wondering why I'm like this.

1088
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,960
All of a sudden?

1089
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,920
After meeting the In-law earlier,

1090
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,050
I felt so embarrassed about myself.

1091
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,300
Aigoo...

1092
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,920
Your father seems like...

1093
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,040
so relaxed, kind, and good.

1094
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,440
Yet, I'm so lousy like this.

1095
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,330
My Seo Yeon must be so embarrassed.

1096
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,060
Geez, why are you saying that?

1097
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,100
You've lived well so proudly all this time.

1098
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,460
I know.

1099
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:50,360
I think I've been so brazen all this time.

1100
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:53,330
 

1101
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,000
 I just wanted to be close 
to my Seo Yeon, 

1102
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,010
 and that's why I opened up a store here. 

1103
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,550
I think it was an immature thing to do.

1104
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:10,300
Gosh, you finally realized that now...

1105
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,870
Don't think like that.

1106
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:20,480
You can live diligently from now on.

1107
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,230
You can tell Chae Woon about
 this store when you have a chance.

1108
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,680
I'll get going then.

1109
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,200
Thanks.

1110
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,830
Tonight isn't a good time, but...

1111
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:58,300
I'll make time and take you out
 for a drink sometime.

1112
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,140
Don't come out.

1113
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,610
Goodbye, Mr. Woo. Thanks.

1114
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:17,460
Someone must've dropped off a coat.

1115
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,490
It's brand new, though.

1116
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,500
It has your name on it, Father.

1117
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,210
My name?

1118
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,700
 

1119
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,200
What's wrong?

1120
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,530
 Don't you have any warm clothes? 

1121
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,810
It's Seo Yeon.

1122
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,920
Seo... Seo Yeon...

1123
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,740
Seo Yeon!

1124
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,470
Seo Yeon!

1125
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,840
Seo Yeon!

1126
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,830
Seo Yeon!

1127
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:00,810
Seo Yeon!

1128
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:03,160
Seo Yeon!

1129
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:09,040
Seo Yeon!

1130
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,840
♫  I'll give you my all  ♫

1131
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,270
♫  I'll give you all my heart  ♫

1132
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:23,110
♫  I'll give you all my day without 
leaving anything behind  ♫

1133
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:26,570
♫  I'll leave my heart open  ♫

1134
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:30,240
♫  I'll burn it all for you  ♫

1135
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,970
♫  You just have to hold my hand  ♫

1136
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,710
♫  Just like now  ♫

1137
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:51,400
♫  I can't express my heart for you  ♫

1138
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:58,040
♫  It's special every moment of every day  ♫

1139
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:05,700
♫  Like the moonlight that 
completed its distant journey  ♫

1140
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:11,800
♫  I pray desperately that 
my heart will reach you  ♫

1141
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,990
♫  I'll give you my all  ♫

1142
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,740
 

1143
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,410
 Eun Ji is Ra Hoon's birth mom? 

1144
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,980
 It's not definite yet. 

1145
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,940
 Then who's the dad? 

1146
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,790
 Eyes, nose, mouth. 

1147
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,570
 They look similar. 
They look exactly the same. 

1148
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:27,630
 Add more personnel? 

1149
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,540
 I guess they're accepting 
applications from current employees. 

1150
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,900
 - If it's a stylist...
- Then it's mine! 

1151
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,450
 Let's not be down just because
 our moms are against us. 

1152
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:35,890
 Let's be proactive about it. 

1153
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,860
 I won't change my mind just
 because you do this. 

1154
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,420
 Geez, Mother! Mother! 

1155
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,990
 You must love Hwang Na Ro immensely. 

1156
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,740
 Your girlfriend Jang Seo Ah
