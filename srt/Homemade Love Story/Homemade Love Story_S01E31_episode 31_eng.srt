1
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,680
 I'm not the CEO's real daughter. 

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,000
 There was a misunderstanding
 like this before. 

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,070
 I hope you don't misconstrue. 

4
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,090
 Excuse me. 

5
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,060
 
Are you feeling better now?

6
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,400
No, I don't feel better.

7
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,110
I'm upset, sad, and angry.

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,650
But...

9
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,050
when I moved into this big house,

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,260
I was ready for it.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,010
So even if I'm not okay, I have to be okay.

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,970
Because I'm Lee Bit Chae Woon.

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,480
Geez.

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,100
Mom.

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,040
Let's not stay here like this. 
Let's go inside.

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,340
Did we do something wrong?
 Why are we hiding?

17
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,760
Be quiet, Hae Deun.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,650
No, I don't want to. I want to go out.

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,250
- Hae Deun!
- Noona.

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,740
Let's not do this.

21
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,990
Let's not do this for
 Chae Woon noona's sake.

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,530
Consider how Chae Woon noona must feel.

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,480
 CEO. 

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,980
Say something.

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,250
Director Jang, what happened?

26
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,040
Yes, Director.

27
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,990
That's right.

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,870
Bit Chae Woon is my 
middle school classmate.

29
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,480
She's been living here due 
to her family issues.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,960
I guess someone misunderstood.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,770
Never mind that.

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,550
Please tell us yourself, sister-in-law.

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,900
That young lady...

34
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,650
Isn't she your birth daughter?

35
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,860
Why can't the CEO say so?

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,330
Why can't she say that 
Unni is her daughter?

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,380
 I think it's strange that... 

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,880
 you can't say anything. 

39
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,000
No, Director.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,690
Mom is put on the spot right now.

41
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,270
Nothing like this ever happened before.

42
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,010
Including that email from last time.

43
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,000
Mom must be in such a shock.

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,220
 That girl is Mom's hidden daughter? 

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,640
 That's nonsense. 

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,100
I'm really sorry, but...

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,850
please go home for the night.

48
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,500
Can we talk about this again tomorrow?

49
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,850
Please?

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,930
Uncle...

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
All right.

52
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,050
We have our plans tonight.

53
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,730
Let's get going.

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,190
I'll tell you.

55
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,350
 Go ahead, sister-in-law. 

56
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,850
Mom...

57
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,430
Go ahead and tell us.

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,910
That girl...

59
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,660
is not my birth daughter.

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,320
She's not.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,520
Well.

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,720
I'm glad to hear you say 
she's not your daughter.

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
But rumor spreads fast.

64
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,990
It will cause a stir among 
high-ranking people and shareholders.

65
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,030
You'll have to be accountable for

66
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,170
spreading false rumors like this, CEO.

67
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,280
Let's go.

68
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,820
Goodbye.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Mom, Mom...

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,230
How could she...

71
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,630
The CEO just denied it, huh?

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,850
She said Unni isn't her daughter, right?

73
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah.

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Mom.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,180
Soon Jung.

76
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,550
CEO.

77
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,590
How could you say that?

78
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,000
How can you deny that 
my unni isn't your daughter?

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,790
- Hae Deun.
- Noona.

80
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,070
Soon Jung, I'm sorry.

81
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,480
I couldn't help it earlier.

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,180
I will...

83
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,860
Please don't say anything.

84
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,000
Chae Woon.

85
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,490
Mom, are you okay?

86
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,720
Yeah.

87
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,820
Where did you go?

88
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,210
Well, outside.

89
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,560
I saw the directors leave, so I came in.

90
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,590
You're berry-berry cold.

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,430
You were cold, huh?

92
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,040
We'll...

93
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,220
get going now.

94
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,830
- Eat before you go.
- No, thanks.

95
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,820
We'll leave.

96
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,040
Chae Woon, we'll go.

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,430
Mom, wait.

98
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,920
Wait, Hae Deun.

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,490
I'll drive them home.

100
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,360
No, Chae Woon, it's okay.

101
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Mom, wait. Let me get my purse.

102
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,830
Soon Jung.

103
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,560
I was so taken aback earlier...

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,290
Can you and I talk for a minute? 
In the library.

105
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,410
Give me a moment.

106
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,050
I don't think...

107
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,410
I can say anything right now.

108
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,250
I'll take them home.

109
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,350
Ms. Joo, get the car ready.

110
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,750
- It's okay.
- No, take... please take the car.

111
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,510
Jae Hee is waiting outside.

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,880
I'll be back.

113
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,930
Okay.

114
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,760
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,710
Gosh, it's so cold.

116
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,900
The house feels so empty.

117
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,820
I wonder if everyone is doing well.

118
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,580
I'm hungry.

119
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,060
Gosh, what's there to eat?

120
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,860
Oh, my...

121
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,910
Why are you so startled?

122
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,340
Well, it's not that...

123
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,300
Aren't you working?

124
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,630
Yes, I am, but...

125
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,760
Geez, my throat felt cold and dry.

126
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,370
I came for a scarf or something.

127
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,950
Your throat sure is a problem.

128
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,250
I made an appointment at my hospital.

129
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,630
In my hospital...

130
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,890
there's a good ENT doctor.

131
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,910
I already have a doctor.

132
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,870
I know you do...

133
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,770
but you should be consistent.

134
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,800
You always forget or 
miss because you're busy.

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,050
When will you heal your 
throat at that rate?

136
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,710
Did you forget about your dream 
of becoming a singer?

137
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,940
Are you going to be done just 
working your part-time job?

138
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,140
I made the appointment 
at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

139
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,480
I know you don't work then. 
So don't miss it.

140
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,290
Thank you.

141
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,690
Here. Over here.

142
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,910
Aunt, this...

143
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,170
Noonim said, you should 
eat this when you wake up.

144
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,850
She boiled it already.

145
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,600
She said you could boil this
 all at once and eat it.

146
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,080
This is...

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,430
It's still warm.

148
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,160
I don't think you need to 
heat it all at once.

149
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,560
All at once. That's nice.

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
What?

151
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,320
No one's home...

152
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,750
should we hug all at once?

153
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,240
All at once?

154
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,830
Forget it if you don't want to.

155
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,100
I'll just heat this all at once.

156
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,810
Man Jung.

157
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm...

158
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,790
really sorry.

159
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,240
♫  Since when was it?  ♫

160
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,090
I just think anyway I want to...

161
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,410
and I behave...

162
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,810
anyway I want to. So...

163
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,540
I'm really sorry to upset you.

164
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,620
I know why you were like that.

165
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,310
But I'm sorry to upset you.

166
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,470
♫  I was afraid  ♫

167
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm so sorry.

168
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,460
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,430
♫  All I think of is you  ♫

170
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,140
♫  I can't do anything  ♫

171
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,040
I wonder...

172
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,280
maybe because I went through
 so much as a child.

173
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,890
Maybe that's why I'm not confident.

174
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,410
Yeah, right, right.

175
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,160
If I...

176
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,420
were loved by someone properly...

177
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,300
maybe I wouldn't be so warped, right?

178
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,680
Yeah, right.

179
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,890
You're a doctor, Man Jung, right?

180
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,590
Can you fix this disease?

181
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,110
I want to heal this...

182
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,840
I'll be good with treatment.

183
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,160
My heart right here...

184
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,620
♫  That you might disappear like the wind  ♫

185
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,010
I can heal you.

186
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,350
What?

187
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,470
I'll prescribe to you.

188
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,120
Listen up, Kim Hwak Se.

189
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,680
- Okay.
- Just...

190
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,690
Don't cry and listen up.

191
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,830
Okay.

192
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,070
You just have to be confident.

193
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,890
Just accept my love.

194
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,750
Just simply.

195
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,080
And Hwak Se, just...

196
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,780
you can give me your love.

197
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,900
Just simply. Boldly. Okay?

198
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,380
Okay.

199
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,270
I love you, Man Jung.

200
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,840
I love you lots.

201
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,140
Be confident.

202
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,380
- Yeah.
- With love and passion...

203
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,890
Mr. Woo, thank you.

204
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,540
We came home comfortably
 thanks to you.

205
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,120
No worries, Mother.

206
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,560
Thank you.

207
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,180
Good night.

208
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,030
Aigoo.

209
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Ms. Lee, coming home now?

210
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,220
Yes. You're working hard.

211
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,640
Yes.

212
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,970
Hello.

213
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,260
Aigoo, long time no see, Chae Woon.

214
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,810
- You're well, right?
- Yes.

215
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,490
- Are you well?
- Of course.

216
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,950
Then talk to your father.

217
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,090
We'll go in first.

218
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,130
Yes, please go in.

219
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,310
Good night.

220
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,750
- Good night.
- Go home.

221
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,770
How did it go?

222
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,670
Did the directors barge in?

223
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,250
Yes.

224
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,680
And?

225
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,990
They asked if Chae Woon
 is her daughter.

226
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,750
Chae Woon said no.

227
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,310
Oh, no.

228
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,410
Aigoo.

229
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,760
Chae Woon must've felt terrible.

230
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,610
What did CEO Kim say?

231
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,340
I haven't asked her that yet.

232
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,010
But I don't think the CEO was able to
 tell the truth, based on their mood.

233
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,070
She runs a corporation. 
She should be careful.

234
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,380
Aigoo, in any case...

235
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,060
Chae Woon must be quite upset.

236
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,420
I know.

237
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,590
I can't eat if you stare at me like that.

238
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,550
Gosh.

239
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,470
Even if I try not to look,

240
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,300
my Jjung-a is so pretty.

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,040
I mean...

242
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,040
how could you be so pretty while eating?

243
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,270
Jjung-a doesn't know if 
the rice is going into her nose

244
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,500
or if the stew is going into her mouth.

245
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,780
Wait a minute.

246
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Oh, my!

247
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,010
Unni.

248
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,990
What's wrong with you?

249
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,740
Unni, you're home.

250
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,690
Why did you come back?

251
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,430
- You're eating dinner now.
- Yeah, Unni.

252
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,540
- Bit Chae.
- Hi, Chae Woon.

253
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,960
Hi, Uncle.

254
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,100
Aigoo, Chae Woon. It's good to see you.

255
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,960
Hey, did you come here to
 drive your mom home?

256
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,340
- Yeah.
- Good job, Chae Woon.

257
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,660
Unni, is something the matter?

258
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,520
Chae Woon, are you hungry?

259
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,190
I'll change and get dinner ready.

260
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,330
Okay.

261
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,650
I get to eat your delicious food
 the first time in a while.

262
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,940
Mom, I'll set the table.

263
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,580
Why are you guys eating again?

264
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,860
You already ate.

265
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,330
- Right?
- I'm not interested.

266
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,350
Why are you eating again?

267
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,780
Ra Hoon, let's do it together.

268
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,040
What's going on?

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,520
Did they feed them just a little bit?

270
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,580
Unni, what's up?

271
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,990
What's up? Something happened
 at that house, huh?

272
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,270
Right?

273
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,500
Unni!

274
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,100
Man Jung.

275
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,660
We still haven't eaten yet.

276
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,560
Let's feed Chae Woon and the kids first.

277
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,550
So, tell me.

278
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,700
Why didn't you guys eat?

279
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,060
Why didn't you eat?

280
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,670
Huh?

281
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,210
Gosh, seriously.

282
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,060
Mr. Woo, you're home.

283
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,850
Mr. Woo, you haven't eaten yet, right?

284
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,520
Eat with us.

285
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,460
Yes, Mother. I'll wash my hands.

286
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,730
What the heck?

287
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,320
Geez.

288
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,020
What?

289
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,890
Lee Hae Deun, let's eat.

290
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,530
I don't want to.

291
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,450
Let's eat.

292
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,980
We haven't eaten together in a while.

293
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,110
It was freezing earlier, huh?

294
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,470
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,790
Weren't you cold, Unni?

296
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,640
Hiding and being cold...

297
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,380
That's not the issue here.

298
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,310
Unni, it's because you 
couldn't see what happened.

299
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,860
The CEO earlier...

300
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,190
Hae Deun, let's eat.

301
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,580
Hurry up and come down.

302
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,790
Let's eat.

303
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,490
Uncle.

304
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,270
Don't you have to go back to work?

305
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,790
Mr. Woo's father must 
be struggling alone.

306
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,330
Oh, yes. I should go.

307
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,330
But we have a new evening part-timer.

308
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,880
It's okay for now.

309
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,100
Unni.

310
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,350
So...

311
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,970
Had I known Chae Woon
 was coming home,

312
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,180
I would've made beef radish soup.

313
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,050
This is delicious, too.

314
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,340
Eat.

315
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,230
Moong-i.

316
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,400
Eat slowly.

317
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,400
 That girl... 

318
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,690
 is not my birth daughter. 

319
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,180
 I'm sorry to put you on the spot, CEO. 

320
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,520
Mom.

321
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,130
You did well.

322
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,820
In any case, Uncle is...

323
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,420
after your position anyway.

324
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,900
You don't need to give him
 to attack you with.

325
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,560
After the projects we're 
currently working on

326
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,720
are all successful,

327
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,430
you can reveal Bit Chae Woon then. 
It won't be late.

328
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,690
Mom!

329
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,770
Hey, what is it?

330
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,990
What is it? Just tell me a little bit.

331
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,170
I don't know.

332
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,950
Do you think I'd throw a fit if I find out?

333
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,120
I won't throw a fit.

334
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,350
I'll hold it in. Okay?

335
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,020
Really?

336
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,480
That's right.

337
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,710
Noona.

338
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,890
Well, I thought you were sleepy.

339
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,070
Aren't you going to sleep?

340
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,290
Hurry up and sleep.

341
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,780
Okay. Get out. I'm going to sleep.

342
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,910
- Get out.
- Geez.

343
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,340
Look at these guys...

344
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,230
It's been so long since I stood here.

345
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,330
Go home now.

346
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,630
A little bit later.

347
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,550
I'll see the guys.

348
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,900
It's late. Hurry up and go home.

349
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
Who could it be?

350
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,750
I'll go out.

351
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,830
Who is it?

352
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,800
It's Jung Won unni.

353
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,300
Unni.

354
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,180
She's here. Unni, what brings you here?

355
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,500
Are you here to get me?

356
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,140
Soon Jung.

357
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,520
I'm really sorry about earlier.

358
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,820
What are you sorry about, Unni?

359
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,560
Come inside.

360
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,780
Gosh, wait. Wait.

361
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,220
Gosh, come on.

362
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,730
I'm sorry, but can you talk here?

363
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,540
These people went over 
there to eat dinner

364
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,560
and came home without eating.
 And they won't talk.

365
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,000
If you came running here,

366
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,350
something big must've happened.

367
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,550
Unni, just talk here.

368
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,480
Auntie.

369
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,120
Let's them talk and...

370
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,040
- let's go upstairs.
- No, I don't want to.

371
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,600
Unni, I'm sorry.

372
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,020
Hey, I don't want your mom

373
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,290
going through something alone.

374
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,270
Unni, I'm sorry. 
Can't you just talk here?

375
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,240
In front of everyone?

376
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,900
What's going on exactly?

377
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,220
Man Jung, I'm sorry, but...

378
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,230
I want to talk to your sister alone.

379
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,510
Yes, Man Jung, stay out of it.

380
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,650
Come inside.

381
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,810
Why are there so many secrets?

382
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,490
CEO...

383
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,820
denied that Unni is her daughter.

384
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,510
Lee Hae Deun, it's not like that.

385
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,130
What do you mean?

386
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,250
She's not your daughter?

387
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,940
To whom?

388
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,140
- When we went to eat dinner there earlier...
- Noona, don't.

389
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,310
Her company directors
 barged into her house.

390
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,560
They received an email saying that 
Unni is the CEO's hidden daughter.

391
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,010
So when the directors asked, you said

392
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,950
Bit Chae isn't your daughter?

393
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,820
Auntie, it's not like that.

394
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,750
I stepped forward and said I wasn't

395
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,390
because the CEO was put on the spot.

396
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,110
She couldn't help it then.

397
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,530
What do you mean she couldn't help it?

398
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,510
After you left like that,

399
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,420
Mom, Ra Hoon, and I...

400
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,630
were hiding on the balcony 
shivering. And the CEO...

401
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,210
The CEO...

402
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,170
Yes.

403
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,930
I said...

404
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,770
that you're not my daughter.

405
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,540
Why?

406
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,650
Why did you say that, Unni?

407
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,070
Unni.

408
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,960
You came to our house, 
drenched in the rain that day...

409
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,350
 - Seo Yeon.
- and asked her to take Bit Chae home. 

410
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,840
 - Let's go home. With me.
- Asking for your baby back. 

411
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,290
 So my unni shed her tears... 

412
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,300
 - and sent her daughter to you.
- Chae Woon! 

413
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,220
 - Why did you say that?
- Chae Woon... 

414
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,910
Unni, are you like that?

415
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,980
Auntie, calm down.

416
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,450
No, I can't calm down.

417
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,690
Unni.

418
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,400
The daughter you abandoned...

419
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,210
My Soon Jung unni...

420
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,920
gave up her life...

421
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,520
- and raised her.
- Man Jung!

422
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,240
That's not true.

423
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,320
The CEO didn't abandon Chae Woon.

424
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,600
No!

425
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,620
Isn't that abandonment, Unni?

426
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,090
You were alive and kicking...

427
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,140
yet you had no idea that 
her dad stole his daughter.

428
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,180
And you didn't know that her grandma
 threw away her granddaughter.

429
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,340
That's abandonment, Unni.

430
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,700
That's what abandonment is.

431
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,550
And you deny your daughter
 after all you've done?

432
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,010
Gosh, were you like that, Unni?

433
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,120
- I see.
- Auntie, please!

434
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,030
Man Jung, stop.

435
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,210
Stop it, Man Jung.

436
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,720
Why did you say that, Unni?

437
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,780
Please stop, Man Jung!

438
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,010
Stop it, Man Jung.

439
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,170
I'm speechless...

440
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,750
that I want to rip out...

441
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,800
my heart, yet I'm holding back. 
What's with you?

442
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,560
What's with you, Man Jung? 
Don't do that.

443
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,820
Don't do that, Man Jung. 
What's wrong with you?

444
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,180
- Don't.
- Mom.

445
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,400
Hey, Hwang Na Ro.

446
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,260
Now what? It's me again?

447
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,030
What do you mean it's you again?

448
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,850
Hey, you're automatically
 feeling guilty now.

449
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,790
What do you mean I feel guilty?

450
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,250
I heard from Seo Ah.

451
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,450
- "Seo Ah"?
- That's right.

452
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,220
Seo Ah and I are dating.

453
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,380
Geez, look at this punk. Seriously!

454
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,420
Hey, what should I do with you?

455
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,460
What do you mean?

456
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,380
I told you to leave me alone
 and go on your way.

457
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,150
I'll go my way. You go your way.

458
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,730
It's you, huh?

459
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,710
The one who sent the 
email to the directors.

460
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,960
Geez...

461
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,050
Why would I do that?

462
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,790
To be on Seo Ah's good side, right?

463
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,460
You're full of love and 
hatred for Chae Woon!

464
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,740
Geez, how dare you keep 
saying "love and hatred"?

465
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,010
So...

466
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,820
did you find Bit Chae Woon's birth father?

467
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,580
What about it? Would you help me out?

468
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,340
Since you're close to him?

469
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,090
Am I crazy? Why would I help you?

470
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,380
You...

471
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,760
You'll have a bitter taste
 in your mouth soon.

472
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,060
You'd better watch your back.

473
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,120
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

474
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,700
Hey, Woo Jae Hee.

475
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,820
Do you know this saying?

476
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,570
"The bluebird is nearby."

477
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,090
Oh, is it not a bluebird?

478
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,840
Is it a nuclear bomb?

479
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,780
Don't you think the person you're
 looking for is close to you?

480
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,760
Jjung-a.

481
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,630
So...

482
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,870
that's what they were doing at that house.

483
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,620
They were hiding on the balcony
 like beggars and shivering.

484
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,200
Jjung-a.

485
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,800
Don't be too upset.

486
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,690
Don't be too upset.

487
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,560
Geez, I need to listen to her.

488
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,660
I need to hear what 
they're saying. My sister...

489
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,670
Move.

490
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,450
Let me listen to them.

491
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,150
Don't go.

492
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,890
Chae Woon is with them. 
Nothing will happen.

493
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,920
Just stay here with me.

494
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,410
And you can hear from 
Noonim later what happened.

495
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,770
Jjung-a.

496
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,460
Just relax.

497
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,950
Relax.

498
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,870
Aigoo...

499
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,570
Gosh, Jjung-a, don't cry. It's okay.

500
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,020
I'm not crying.

501
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,290
- What?
- I'm not crying.

502
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,480
You can keep hugging me, though.

503
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,340
Unni.

504
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,970
Hi, you're home.

505
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,500
Did something happen?

506
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,180
I saw Bit Chae Woon unni 
and the CEO out there.

507
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,820
Are they talking right now?

508
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,060
Yeah.

509
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,030
I'm really sorry, Soon Jung.

510
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,100
I was going to...

511
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,420
tell them honestly, but...

512
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,830
when I thought of the company...

513
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,470
The rumor that says...

514
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,020
that I'll inherit the company
 to my hidden daughter.

515
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,220
Even though it may not be true,

516
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,320
it's not something I can silence easily.

517
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,930
Yes.

518
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,330
Earlier...

519
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,350
I also felt dismal and speechless.

520
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,020
But I'll still try to understand.

521
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,880
You're Chae Woon's birth mom...

522
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,060
and you're an important person
 leading a big company.

523
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,330
Thanks for your 
understanding, Soon Jung.

524
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,890
So...

525
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,460
I have a request, CEO.

526
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,830
Up until now, we haven't had a chance.

527
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,060
So I've been delaying this.

528
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,220
Please...

529
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,060
put Chae Woon on your family 
registry as your daughter.

530
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,450
Mom, there's no need to do that yet.

531
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,460
I looked into it...

532
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,350
If you...

533
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,080
get ruling on the maternity rights,

534
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,400
and if you request an amendment
 on your family registry, you can.

535
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,010
And if I request...

536
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,960
a dissolution of adoption of Chae Woon,

537
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,860
you can register her as your daughter

538
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,240
on your family registry.

539
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,800
If you feel bad...

540
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,390
toward Chae Woon about 
what happened tonight,

541
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,620
if you regret it...

542
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,660
please start the procedure
 as soon as possible.

543
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,800
Mom.

544
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,230
The paperwork doesn't need to be rushed.

545
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,730
Once the strange rumors die down...

546
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,040
The strange rumors will be endless.

547
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,050
As long as the CEO is in a vital position.

548
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,500
CEO.

549
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,700
As for me...

550
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,990
I don't know much...

551
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,880
and compared to you,

552
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,080
I'm really nothing.

553
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,110
But as a mom...

554
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,500
no matter what a bind you're in,

555
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,520
I think you should reveal...

556
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,500
the child you love to the world.

557
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,680
Because you're a mom.

558
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,450
That's why I'm asking you for this favor.

559
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,180
Yes.

560
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,090
I should.

561
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,020
My Seo Yeon...

562
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,820
I should register her as my daughter.

563
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,670
Thank you.

564
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,150
But Soon Jung...

565
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,840
I'd like you to give me some time.

566
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,320
As you said earlier...

567
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,910
because I'm the leader 
of my company...

568
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,110
it's not something I can rush

569
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,600
on my own and make the decisions.

570
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,580
What do you mean you can't make
 the decisions on your own?

571
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,710
What can't you decide?

572
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,180
The fact that Chae Woon
 is your daughter?

573
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,250
Soon Jung.

574
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,880
Please consider my position.

575
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,010
This isn't only about my personal life.

576
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,750
The company employees,

577
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,150
the subsidiary employees, and...

578
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,460
I have to consider so many 
people who are watching me.

579
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,960
Among all that, the biggest problem is...

580
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,120
your greed, CEO.

581
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,190
Soon Jung, how could you...

582
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
How could you say that?

583
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,910
I came here running to apologize.

584
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,425
How can you say that?

585
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:33,335
Honestly, I'm so taken aback.

586
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:36,345
How can you be so insistent, Soon Jung?

587
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:38,995
Please stop, both of you.

588
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:49,165
Mom, because of what 
you went through tonight...

589
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:51,155
even if only on paper...

590
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,435
you want me to be recognized 
as the CEO's daughter.

591
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:54,995
That's what you want.

592
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,025
I can understand that, but...

593
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:02,035
that's not important to me.

594
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:04,965
I just...

595
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:08,315
I just...

596
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:14,665
didn't want to be a burden

597
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:18,805
to the CEO.

598
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:21,915
- No, Seo Yeon.
- Chae Woon...

599
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:23,795
What are you saying?

600
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,135
But...

601
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:29,595
I think I'm already a burden to her.

602
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,135
I feel bad...

603
00:34:38,385 --> 00:34:42,185
Can we just wrap up here tonight?

604
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:46,105
Okay.

605
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,395
Let's do that.

606
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:50,905
It's late.

607
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:54,665
Chae Woon, take the CEO home.

608
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,745
Okay.

609
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:02,725
Mom.

610
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:06,645
I want to stay over tonight.

611
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:09,435
No.

612
00:35:09,435 --> 00:35:12,165
Go home with the CEO.

613
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:13,825
I want to sleep here tonight.

614
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:17,545
I can do that, right?

615
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:20,795
Of course.

616
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:27,755
Mr. Kim drove you here, right?

617
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,725
Yeah.

618
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:32,925
Okay, then.

619
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,845
Be careful going home.

620
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,765
I'll go ahead.

621
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:09,755
 It's my fault. 

622
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,345
 I should have... 

623
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:20,085
 protected you somehow. 

624
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:27,415
Please give me some time.

625
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,035
Ms. Lee.

626
00:36:52,095 --> 00:36:54,055
Mr. Woo.

627
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,005
Are you done with work?

628
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,265
Yes.

629
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:00,685
Man Jung is at the jokbal place.

630
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,055
She said you told her to stay outside.

631
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,405
Yes.

632
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:08,255
I had to speak with the CEO.

633
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:09,755
I see.

634
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:12,175
Did the talk go over well?

635
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,915
Did you come to see Mr. Woo?

636
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:18,265
Come inside, Mr. Woo.

637
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:19,455
No, I didn't.

638
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:23,185
I was on my way home, 
but I was worried about you.

639
00:37:26,395 --> 00:37:30,225
I heard about what happened tonight.

640
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:31,785
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:34,725
I was worried, so I asked Jae Hee.

642
00:37:34,725 --> 00:37:36,925
Oh, no.

643
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:40,075
Thank you for worrying about us.

644
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:44,925
Soon Jung.

645
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:50,805
 Soon Jung, back then and even now... 

646
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:53,665
 Why are you struggling so much? 

647
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:58,495
Then, I'll get going.

648
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,505
Okay. Be careful going home.

649
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,615
Ms. Lee.

650
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,215
Smile.

651
00:38:13,215 --> 00:38:16,135
You'll have something to laugh
 about as much as you laugh.

652
00:38:18,455 --> 00:38:19,825
Okay.

653
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:30,235
Soon Jung, laugh.

654
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,455
They say you'll have something to
 laugh about as much as you laugh.

655
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:35,665
Laugh.

656
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:43,705
Not like that. Like this.

657
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:06,915
 Jung Hoo oppa... 

658
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:11,595
 You're still as kind as you used to be. 

659
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,450
Mom, did you go to
 Bit Chae Woon's house?

660
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,900
Where is Bit Chae Woon?

661
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,890
She wants to sleep over there.

662
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,970
Who could've sent the email...

663
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,790
to the directors?

664
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,990
Who would've done that?

665
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,100
I'm not sure.

666
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,270
Wouldn't it be someone who wants to
 reveal that Bit Chae Woon is your daughter?

667
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,210
Could someone from 
her family do that?

668
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,390
Her mom or her siblings.

669
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,200
No.

670
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,650
It could be the opposite.

671
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,090
Someone who doesn't 
want her to be revealed.

672
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,590
Someone who knows well...

673
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,550
who Kim Jung Won is.

674
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,640
Mom, by chance...

675
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,570
are you suspicious of me?

676
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,130
It could be Bit Chae Woon's birth father.

677
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,320
I heard it from Chairwoman.

678
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,770
That Bit Chae Woon's birth father 
was released from prison.

679
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,290
Chairwoman told you all that?

680
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,780
Yes.

681
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,700
I heard that man gave you
 a hard time in the past.

682
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,690
He must want to reveal that 
Bit Chae Woon is your daughter

683
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,540
for him to get some benefits.

684
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,830
Seo Ah.

685
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,730
That bothers me.

686
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,980
That you're assuming that 
much and imagining that.

687
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,970
I'm sorry, Mom.

688
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,500
Whoa...

689
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,980
Congrats, Lee Hae Deun. Good job!

690
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,340
Congrats, Lee Hae Deun!

691
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,680
Congrats!

692
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm dizzy!

693
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,330
I'm back...

694
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,910
to my room.

695
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,810
To my house.

696
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,060
 

697
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,610
 Moong, who is under
 the same roof as me. 

698
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,900
 Are you asleep? 

699
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,350
 No, not yet. 

700
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,850
Yes, Koala.

701
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,390
This is so nice.

702
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,410
Since we're under the same roof,

703
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,050
it feels like your voice sounds closer.

704
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,170
What the heck?

705
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,500
Since we're close by,

706
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,080
should we see each other?

707
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,430
Should we?

708
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,960
Then should we get together 
by the front door? No, no.

709
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,080
Should we meet in the 
living room and go out? No, no.

710
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,860
 It's too cold outside. 

711
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,650
Should I come to your room
 for a minute?

712
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,850
Oh?

713
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,780
Could you do that?

714
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,430
 Why can't I? 

715
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,340
We'll be wholesome. 
Just for ten minutes.

716
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,080
Wholesome?

717
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,490
Ten minutes?

718
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,680
Okay.

719
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,450
Come on now.

720
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,980
I said only for ten minutes, 
and we'll be wholesome.

721
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,970
This is wholesome.

722
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,880
It was a long day for you, huh?

723
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,270
Because you stayed with me,

724
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,750
it was bearable.

725
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,030
I guess not.

726
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,020
I thought I was okay.

727
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,740
I totally understand the CEO,

728
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,190
and I also think it's the right thing.

729
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,510
But I don't know why 
my heart aches so much.

730
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,490
♫  In the pitch-black road of mine  ♫

731
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,220
I get so angry because this is 
all I can do in this situation.

732
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,260
But if I show that, Mom will be upset.

733
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,530
So...

734
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,620
when I try to act as if I'm not hurting...

735
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,050
I felt more miserable.

736
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,400
I guess you would feel that way.

737
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,990
But...

738
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,540
I'm sure the CEO has 
a lot to think about.

739
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,120
She must be struggling, too.

740
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,520
♫  This tearfully lonely night  ♫

741
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,890
Maybe I shouldn't have moved
 into the CEO's house.

742
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,700
Gosh, no.

743
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,230
You moved in there to
 clear your mom's name.

744
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,630
So you got to clear her name...

745
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,290
and just think that the CEO 
and you're still adjusting.

746
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,080
♫  Love is so difficult  ♫

747
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,460
♫  Life is so hard  ♫

748
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
So, your room is so cozy.

749
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,620
Of course.

750
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,010
It's my room.

751
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,510
This is it.

752
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,860
The new officetel contract.

753
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,280
If I get that bid,

754
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,430
my company will breathe a little,

755
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,320
and I'll get to pay off my debt.

756
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,970
It will work out.

757
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,300
I'll help you so that you can be prepared.

758
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,340
I'd be so grateful if you'd do that.

759
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,250
♫  The shining day will come  ♫

760
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,920
Mr. Woo, do you have a towel?

761
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,280
Moong-i!

762
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,240
What?

763
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,130
Wait.

764
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,030
Hyungnim!

765
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,310
Hyungnim!

766
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,750
What the heck? Hyungnim!

767
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,420
Open the door. A towel?

768
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,220
No, no. I can dry it like this.

769
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,460
Like this. It's okay. Get back
 to what you were doing.

770
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,280
Geez. Open the door.

771
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,010
Why did you lock the door?
 I'll give you a towel.

772
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,120
Aigoo, it's okay. I didn't see anything.

773
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,220
 I'll stay here. So get back 
to what you were doing. 

774
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,710
Geez.

775
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,930
Hyungnim, come on.

776
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,440
Love is...

777
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,350
such a wonderful thing.

778
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,800
Moong-i.

779
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,960
 

780
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,630
 Hello. 

781
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,680
 Hello. 

782
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,640
Hello, CEO.

783
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,600
Did you sleep well last night?

784
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,730
Yes.

785
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,860
How about you, CEO?

786
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,250
Hello, CEO.

787
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,670
I slept well, too.

788
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,450
Shall we go home together later?

789
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,390
 

790
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,330
 Even now, Seo Ah's uncle and aunts... 

791
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,220
 Don't you know that 
they're after your position? 

792
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,330
 Please put... 

793
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,900
 Chae Woon on your family 
registry as your daughter. 

794
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,850
CEO!

795
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,430
I just met with Uncle.

796
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,100
Director Jang?

797
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,250
Why?

798
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,940
Uncle just received a call...

799
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,660
What call?

800
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,430
From someone named Park Pil Hong.

801
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,580
What did that man say to him?

802
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,230
What did he say?

803
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,240
It's true that you and
 he had a daughter.

804
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,580
To acknowledge him.

805
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,210
What did you say?

806
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,900
Where are you going, Mom?

807
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,380
To meet Director Jang.

808
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,290
I have to go and explain.
 To say it's not true.

809
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:36,660
Uncle just left for a meeting.

810
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,820
I'm telling you because 
I'm so worried about my mom.

811
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,680
How much your existence 
is bogging her down.

812
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,220
I thought you should know.

813
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,950
You have no proof that say

814
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,480
it was Park Pil Hong who called.

815
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,367
Why?

816
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,270
Are you siding with him 
because he's your father?

817
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,500
No.

818
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,990
I think someone may think

819
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,280
what a relief it is that
 there's Park Pil Hong

820
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,740
to take all the blame for all this.

821
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,790
If you're done,

822
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,180
I'll get going, Director.

823
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,890
Please...

824
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,560
consider my mom's position.

825
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,280
You don't want all of 
my mom's hard work

826
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,690
to be taken away because of you.

827
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,460
I hope you determine what is the

828
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,930
wise path.

829
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,610
The wise path.

830
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,620
It's not a piece of advice
 I need to take from you.

831
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,940
Are you feeling guilty?

832
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,720
When I see Mom suffer so much...

833
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,450
I feel bad.

834
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,140
You can't get weak.

835
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,530
This is just the beginning.

836
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:49,290
 

837
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,110
  The customer can't answer the call right now. 
You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

838
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,290
 

839
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,270
 

840
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,130
Geez, the office is so cold.

841
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,670
I couldn't pay the rent. 
I guess they turned off the gas.

842
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,740
It's freezing.

843
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,080
Why isn't Director Lee here yet?

844
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,720
I have to meet with the client.

845
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,800
Yes.

846
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,710
Why aren't you coming in, Director Lee?

847
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

848
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,290
I'm not feeling well.

849
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:47,570
Are you sick?

850
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:51,030
How? Do you have the flu?

851
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,920
I don't know.

852
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,680
I feel so weak...

853
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,870
and I feel dizzy.

854
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,790
Really? Are you very ill?

855
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,130
 I don't usually get sick. 

856
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,800
 But I'm not too well today. 

857
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,820
I know.

858
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,510
You usually seem healthy. 
Why get sick all of a sudden?

859
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,290
I have to meet the client later. 
What should I do?

860
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,260
I worked on the styling.

861
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,800
I'll send it over via messenger.

862
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,870
No, don't send a messenger. Wait.

863
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,870
Should I come over to pick it up?

864
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,220
No, I'll send it right over.

865
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,430
You'll reimburse for
 the delivery fee anyway.

866
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,460
Of course.

867
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,010
So I'll just come and pick it up.

868
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,960
I have to save every penny.

869
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,130
Why call a messenger?

870
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,650
I know where you live

871
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:35,660
and got to sleep over in 
Jae Hee's room. I'll stop by.

872
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,320
If you're doing this because 
you're worried about me,

873
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,530
I'm really fine.

874
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,040
That's not it.

875
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,000
Worry? What worry?

876
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,530
I'm not worried.

877
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,590
Well, I don't want to waste money.
 I'll just do it myself.

878
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,270
I'll go right now.

879
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,530
Okay.

880
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,770
I think he's worried about me.

881
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,240
Gosh, why do I feel so weak?

882
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,180
Was I in too much of a shock 
at Unni's place last night?

883
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,720
When I'm feeling this way,

884
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,800
I wonder how Unni feels.

885
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,510
Why is she sick?

886
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,860
It seems like I like her 
if I do this! Well...

887
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,560
Well...

888
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,460
The employee is sick, 
so the CEO is worried, of course.

889
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,420
Because I'm the CEO.

890
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,820
I made too many mistakes
 last time after getting drunk.

891
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,150
I should go and apologize.

892
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,620
Geez, you scared me!

893
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,770
What the heck?

894
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,790
Why are you dressed in 
all black? You scared me.

895
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,350
How long have you been standing here?

896
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:55,100
Since last night.

897
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,510
Is this your workplace?

898
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:00,750
Whoa, looking good.

899
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,760
You're running a fine business. 
Why can't you see your mom?

900
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,270
What do you mean a fine business?

901
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,060
I can't even pay the rent here.

902
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,870
Can't you see the space heater?

903
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,110
I'm in a rush. I have to go.

904
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,370
- Why are you here?
- I made time to stop by, too.

905
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,080
I have to take care of 
business in the next building.

906
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,230
Really?

907
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,420
All right, sit down since you're here.

908
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,800
Let's sit down and talk. Sit.

909
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,430
Grab a beverage from the fridge.

910
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:23,080
Geez...

911
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,600
Stand? Fine. Stand up.

912
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,680
Speak.

913
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,560
What is it? Are you here about Seo Ah?

914
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,520
Seo Ah keeps fighting with 
Lee Bit Chae Woon. Is that why you're here?

915
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,470
What should I do with her?

916
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,390
Should I bring her here 
and live with her?

917
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,400
Seo Ah is a problem, too, but...

918
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,870
you should move back home or...

919
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,060
meet your mom.

920
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,420
Why?

921
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,330
Last night, your company directors

922
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,170
almost found out about 
Chae Woon. It was crazy.

923
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,350
The CEO wrapped things up, but...

924
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,870
she must be having a hard time.

925
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,040
You should go and
 take care of her, man.

926
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,790
I don't think my mom wants 
me to take care of her.

927
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,670
I shouldn't appear in front of my mom.

928
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,370
I think that's helping 
my mom, in my opinion.

929
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:08,850
- You know that.
- Hey, Jang Joon Ah.

930
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,690
"Hey, Jang Joon Ah." Like that?

931
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:13,030
- Whoa, cool.
- Geez.

932
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,490
All right, all right.

933
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,930
All right, all right.

934
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:18,500
All right. I'll meet Mom today.

935
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:23,710
I don't think I can move 
back home and stuff.

936
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,040
I'll just say hello.

937
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,390
I guess I'll get hit a few times, 
and that'll be it.

938
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:32,460
Actually, I did try to 
meet her several times.

939
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,600
But we kept missing each other.

940
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,390
In my opinion...

941
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,630
I think my mom is refusing to meet me.

942
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,350
Is it our fate that's refusing us?

943
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,530
Stop your rambling.

944
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,470
I'm off.

945
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,000
Hey, hey. Let's go together.

946
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,050
You have your car, right?

947
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,760
- Give me a ride.
- I have to stop by next door for work.

948
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,610
That wasn't your excuse?

949
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,950
You really came to the 
next building for work?

950
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,680
Then...

951
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,150
were you really here since last night?

952
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,890
Geez, seriously.

953
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,530
Where... where were you hiding?

954
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,120
Would I be able to return this?

955
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,890
I have to put it back in 
her room where it was.

956
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,450
What if Soon Jung

957
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,800
doesn't lead me into her room today?

958
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,120
I'll say I'm cold.

959
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,960
That I want to sit on the warm floor.

960
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,040
I'm so smart. Oh, my.

961
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,050
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo.

962
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,690
What are you doing here?

963
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,810
Aren't you working in the evenings?

964
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:32,320
Don't you know I'm off work
 from the company today?

965
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,090
I wouldn't know that.

966
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,580
Why are you off?
 It's not even the weekend.

967
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,610
Today is our company's anniversary.

968
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,160
Oh, that's right.

969
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,310
You used to say why 
should you take a day off

970
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:44,490
on the company anniversary.

971
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,180
I guess today is that day.

972
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,050
But why are you here?

973
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:50,130
Even on off days,

974
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,980
you used to work at the office.

975
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,010
This is my workplace, too.

976
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,410
I did all the work at 
the office early this morning.

977
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,940
I just got here to work here.

978
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,840
But what brings you here?

979
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,970
I think Jae Hee left for work already.

980
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:06,060
I'm here to see Soon Jung.

981
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,970
But it's weird.

982
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,350
What's weird?

983
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,160
Are you speaking...

984
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,220
honorifics to me?

985
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,390
- Yes.
- Why?

986
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,860
Because...

987
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,080
we're strangers now.

988
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,180
Because I want to be polite.

989
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,920
Strangers?

990
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,210
 

991
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,940
It's time to take my medicine.

992
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,600
Could I have a glass of water, 
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo?

993
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,860
Of course.

994
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,370
Come on in.

995
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:42,820
Here's water.

996
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,150
- Thank you.
- Sure.

997
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,030
What kind of medicine is that?

998
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,380
This?

999
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,820
For my de...

1000
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,500
It's a delicious vitamin.

1001
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,000
Thank you for the water.

1002
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,640
- Bye now.
- Okay, bye.

1003
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:17,910
Oh, wait.

1004
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,400
What's this?

1005
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,930
 

1006
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,120
Wait.

1007
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,720
Soon Jung had this.

1008
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,150
Why does Min Jae...

1009
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,130
Oh, no!

1010
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,980
My gosh!

1011
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:50,570
What do I do? What do I do?

1012
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,690
Oh, my gosh! So embarrassing!

1013
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,650
What's he doing?

1014
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,910
What the heck?

1015
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,490
Is he thinking about Soon Jung?

1016
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,870
Thinking of old memories?

1017
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,770
Jung Hoo oppa!

1018
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:05,960
How can you do that?

1019
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,390
Why did you give that
 red dictionary to Soon Jung?

1020
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,650
I said I want that as my birthday gift.

1021
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,160
Why did you give it to her?

1022
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,170
Soon Jung said her dream 
is to become a novelist.

1023
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,980
I thought it'd be good for her
 to study the Korean dictionary.

1024
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,780
I told you I want to 
become a novelist, too.

1025
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,130
You did?

1026
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,540
- When?
- At the park last time!

1027
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,750
See?

1028
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,750
You never listen to what I say,

1029
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,730
but you hold everything
 Soon Jung says

1030
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:33,520
in your heart even if she says once.

1031
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,790
I hate you, Oppa.

1032
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,960
Hate you!

1033
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,040
Wait...

1034
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,340
It's because I felt sorry for Soon Jung.

1035
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,090
Because she suffers so much.

1036
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,190
Jung Min Jae...

1037
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:57,510
She must've been so sad then.

1038
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,500
What do I do?

1039
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,380
What do I do? So embarrassing! 
Embarrassing!

1040
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,620
- I can't go back and get it.
- Mr. Woo.

1041
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,180
Here's the order.

1042
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,760
Okay, boss.

1043
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,960
Now is the time.

1044
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,630
Min Jae...

1045
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,740
still is a fast runner.

1046
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,480
I guess no one's home?

1047
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,520
Yes.

1048
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,170
When no one's home,

1049
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:58,830
how can you let a man 
inside the house?

1050
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,900
Where is a man?

1051
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,800
Are you a comic? What the heck?
 I'm a man here.

1052
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,920
Nah. You're just Mr. Makjang.

1053
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,390
You're totally dissing me.

1054
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,580
I'm not. I'm telling the truth.

1055
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,940
And I thought you were sick.

1056
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,620
You seem fine to me.

1057
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,030
Are you faking?

1058
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,880
I'm not.

1059
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,050
My heart aches.

1060
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,020
What? Your heart?

1061
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,550
Your heart aches?

1062
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,850
Hae Deun, you're missing work 
because of heartache.

1063
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,260
Yes. Wait just a moment.

1064
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,290
Of course, you should miss work. 
Your heart aches.

1065
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,980
She doesn't see me
 as a man, either. Geez.

1066
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,420
Here.

1067
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,600
Here are all the items 
she needs for her styling.

1068
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,760
This is the styling guide.

1069
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,760
You just have to stylize her like this.

1070
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,110
What's this?

1071
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,030
Oh, is this it? The "scuzzy" look?

1072
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,330
No, it's the "s***ty rude" look.

1073
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:55,040
S***ty... s***ty rude?

1074
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,390
- That's my sister's nickname.
- What?

1075
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,900
No, nothing.

1076
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,290
I saw this client's request.

1077
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,930
I think she needs confidence 
that's full of s***ty rudeness.

1078
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:08,020
I tried the outfit on. Wait.

1079
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,810
- You tried it on?
- Yeah.

1080
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,800
- Why try it on?
- Like this.

1081
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,700
Like this.

1082
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,140
Gosh, come here.

1083
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,890
- Why so close...
- Like this. The point is the shoes.

1084
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,820
- Come on, look.
- Why are you pulling me?

1085
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,050
You can't mess up the order of this style.

1086
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:30,030
This black is the point and 
the red shoes... Look here!

1087
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:32,770
I don't think I need to look 
at it this closely.

1088
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,560
Why not? You have to look 
carefully to stylize her well.

1089
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,440
Look at it straight.

1090
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,720
I think we should stand apart.

1091
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,890
What are you saying? Look at it.

1092
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:45,500
- The shoes are the point.
- Why are you showing a close-up of your legs?

1093
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:49,410
Soon Jung, I'm in front of your house.

1094
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,130
Hi, Young Lady Min Jae.

1095
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,720
Did you rush home because of me?

1096
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,010
No.

1097
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,570
I had to stop by the mart 
right around the corner.

1098
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:00,870
I was just passing by and 
thought of you. So I stopped by.

1099
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,030
Since Mr. Woo is at that store, I guess...

1100
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,890
No, no.

1101
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,960
I came here to see you, Soon Jung.

1102
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,260
Come in.

1103
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,680
Soon Jung!

1104
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,600
Yes?

1105
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,150
You know the dried persimmons
 that we're selling?

1106
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,720
Just a moment.

1107
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,130
Go inside first.

1108
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,040
What did you decide on that?

1109
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,360
I don't think the price is right.

1110
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,990
I'm off, Director Lee.

1111
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:30,520
Stay there for a minute. I'll walk you out.

1112
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,560
Walk me out?

1113
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,860
Soon Jung might take some time.

1114
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,180
Now is the time.

1115
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,840
My gosh. Answer the phone.

1116
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,290
  The customer can't answer
 the call right now. 

1117
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:03,030
  You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

1118
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,610
I'm starving.

1119
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,560
Let's eat dongtae stew today.

1120
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:17,850
 

1121
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:22,910
My Jung Won is calling 
for the sixth time already.

1122
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:25,650
It means something has happened.

1123
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,960
 You don't want all of 
my mom's hard work 

1124
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,980
 to be taken away because of you. 

1125
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,280
It's Koala.

1126
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,120
What are you so worried about now?

1127
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,820
 Boy, I'm starving. 

1128
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,340
Why?

1129
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,270
My Seo Yeon looks like 
she's having a hard time.

1130
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,190
Something definitely is up.

1131
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,560
Let's go eat first.

1132
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,950
 Mr. Lee, hurry up and come! 

1133
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,350
It's Mr. Lee.

1134
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:34,110
 Don't you think the person 
you're looking for is close to you? 

1135
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,810
 Isn't this ahjussi a bit suspicious? 

1136
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,370
Moong-i.

1137
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:38,690
Give me a minute.

1138
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,390
- Park Pil Hong.
- Yes?

1139
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,790
It's you, huh?

1140
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,000
You're Park Pil Hong.

1141
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,040
Mr. Lee!

1142
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:38,450
♫  Did you forget? 
Did you forget about me?  ♫

1143
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:43,570
♫  Did you forget all those memories  ♫

1144
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:49,310
♫  My heart is opening arms to you  ♫

1145
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:54,690
♫  I'm barely going through today  ♫

1146
01:07:54,690 --> 01:08:00,440
♫  When the memories are fading  ♫

1147
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:05,350
♫  But I can still hear you 
breathing on my ear  ♫

1148
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,250
 

1149
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,520
 Why is there an urgent 
executives' meeting? 

1150
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,160
 I think they're discussing
 the CEO's reappointment. 

1151
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,100
 If a rumor like this continues, 

1152
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,370
 we'll have to move forward with the 
voting on the CEO's reappointment. 

1153
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:21,030
 If I support you, how will you repay me? 

1154
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,500
 I'll stop Park Pil Hong. 

1155
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,400
 I appointed Hwang Na Ro 
as my personal assistant. 

1156
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,570
 Chairwoman. 

1157
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,290
 Hey, kid, do you live here? 

1158
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,800
 Hello, I moved here today. 

1159
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,810
 I was just passing by... 

1160
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,430
 - Who are you?
- Who are you, grandpa? 

1161
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:37,640
 "Grandpa?" 

1162
