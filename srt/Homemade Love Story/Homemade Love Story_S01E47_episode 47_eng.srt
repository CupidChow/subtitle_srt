1
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,900
Seo Yeon...

2
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,550
Seo Yeon...

3
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,370
Seo Yeon...

4
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,370
 

5
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,950
Huh?

6
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,160
What are you doing here?

7
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,550
I can't believe you're waiting for me.

8
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,220
I wanted to go home with you 
since I'm in the neighborhood.

9
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,050
Is something the matter?

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,180
Chae Woon found out.

11
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,200
About her father running 
a clothing repair store here.

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,650
Really?

13
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,990
Did you talk to Chae Woon about it?

14
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,840
I called her haven't had 
a chance to talk yet.

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,590
I'm sure she's home right now.

16
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,240
She must not feel too good.

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,220
Her father as well.

18
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,490
I know.

19
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,420
Well, since I work with him 
in the same neighborhood,

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,080
I'll look after Park Pil Hong from now on.

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,020
Oh, I'd be so grateful if you'd do that, Dad.

22
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,390
Let's go.

23
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,660
Seo Yeon...

24
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,710
Chae Woon.

25
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,220
Father!

26
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,850
Did you have a nice day?

27
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,400
Chae Woon, were you cleaning?

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,630
Just a little bit.

29
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,590
Geez, we should clean up
 together on our day off.

30
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,120
You must be tired from working, too.

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,860
I cleaned up just a little bit.

32
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,660
Chae Woon, I'm home, too.

33
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,900
You only saw Dad? Don't you see me?

34
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,480
- Father.
- What?

35
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,960
Do you hear a voice coming 
from somewhere right now?

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,070
I'm not sure.

37
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,750
I don't hear anything at all.

38
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,030
Why do I hear it then?

39
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,650
What in the world?

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,070
Dad, Chae Woon, I'm sad.

41
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,910
Oh, Jae Hee!

42
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,750
Did you come with him, too, Jae Hee?

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,920
Oh, no. I still can't see anything.

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,850
- Really?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,780
What in the world?

46
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,400
What? Dad, were you always a joker?

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,750
Give it.

48
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,180
It's good to sanitize it like this 
when you get home.

49
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,130
Gosh, we can't do this.

50
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,870
I have to finish that, Koala.

51
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,720
Moong-i, you already knew, huh?

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,550
About your father opening up a clothing
 repair shop in front of the villa.

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,290
I'm sorry for not telling you.

54
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,210
I just thought you'd be upset.

55
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,370
That's why I couldn't tell you.

56
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,320
No. I'm grateful.

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,710
For taking care of Park Pil Hong like that.

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,040
Gosh, but I'm a little bit embarrassed 
and feel bad toward you.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,670
What are you embarrassed
 and feel bad about?

60
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,090
You're me, and I'm you now.

61
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,600
Isn't that why we got married?

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,720
Don't think like that. Got it?

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,970
Okay.

64
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,090
Oh, Mother's birthday is coming up soon.

65
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,580
Oh, is it? Is it already that time?

66
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,760
Yeah.

67
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,590
What should we do for Mother's birthday?

68
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,830
It's her first birthday since our wedding. 
I want to treat her nicely.

69
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,230
What did you do for her every year?

70
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,550
Well, just...

71
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,610
Mom and I'll just eat out and...

72
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,250
How about Father?

73
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,170
Father was always busy.

74
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,420
Then I'll discuss it with Father tomorrow.

75
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,010
Sure.

76
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,830
Moong-i, finish that up, and

77
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,400
shall we go for a walk?

78
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
Shall we?

79
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,580
Oh! There's a place I wanted
 us to go together.

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,090
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,290
 
This is where you wanted to go?

82
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,650
Yeah.

83
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,360
We never got to shop like this 
together while preparing our wedding.

84
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,730
I wanted to come to places
 like this with you.

85
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,450
Let's try sitting here.

86
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,960
Whoa.

87
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,850
Gosh, it's so comfy.

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,360
Jae Hee, look at this.

89
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,260
Wow!

90
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,870
This looks very pricy.

91
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,790
Moong-i, I'll make lots of money

92
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,120
and buy you everything here.

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,760
Really? Then I'll look in advance.

94
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,480
Whoa.

95
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,400
It's nice.

96
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,140
 Now, this is all I can do for you. 

97
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,740
 What could I do? 

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,550
Geez, Jung Hoo makes me think 
of him no matter how hard I try.

99
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,750
I do get butterflies when 
I see Professor Son, though.

100
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,880
Should I stop having butterflies now?

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,790
I got my life back being on my own.

102
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,160
I can't go on forever worrying 
about these two men.

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,510
Should I end it and get it over 
with, Jung Min Jae?

104
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,940
I wonder if Professor Son is home.

105
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,810
Should I really end it, Jung Min Jae?

106
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,410
 
Oh, my God!

107
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,800
 

108
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,500
Yes, Professor Son.

109
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,320
Noonim, I'm sorry to call you so late.

110
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,170
I'm in my studio right now.

111
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,920
I'm not able to go home because 
something came up at work.

112
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,950
Oh, really?

113
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,220
 I thought I'd be home soon, 
so I asked the sitter to go home. 

114
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,830
 But my Ba Wi isn't answering the phone. 

115
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,330
Oh, my. Is that right?

116
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,300
Then I'll go over.

117
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,650
Would you?

118
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,930
Thank you.

119
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,480
 I'll call you back after I check on him. 

120
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,820
Yes, yes.

121
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,910
Ba Wi fell asleep while watching TV.

122
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,840
That's why he couldn't answer the phone.

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Really?

124
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,390
Seriously, that kid.

125
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,320
Ba Wi, it's your dad.

126
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,430
Dad, I'm sorry.

127
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,960
 Oh, no, Ba Wi! 

128
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,660
 I'm sorry. 

129
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,570
Do you know how worried I got 
when you didn't answer the phone?

130
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,080
You did this last time, too.

131
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,180
Ba Wi, don't cry.

132
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,420
It's because you woke up 
in the middle of your sleep.

133
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,480
Well, Professor, don't worry.

134
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,410
I'll put him down to sleep here.

135
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,680
I don't know what to say 
because I feel so bad.

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,180
Don't mention it.

137
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,060
Relax and finish up your work.

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,190
Okay.

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,390
Ba Wi.

140
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,120
Ba Wi, look at your face.

141
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,830
If you go to bed after eating like this,

142
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,940
you'll get a cavity, and it will hurt you.

143
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,150
Why don't you brush your teeth, 
wash your face

144
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,710
and go to sleep here?

145
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,740
Okay.

146
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,490
Let's go.

147
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,820
Brush, brush, brush, brush.

148
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,940
Isn't it so weird?

149
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,040
Before our moms found 
out about us,

150
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,180
I don't think we felt so much
 love for each other.

151
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,560
Aigoo, aigoo.

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,870
Hae Deun, my baby. 
Do you feel the love?

153
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,230
You know how it is. When people 
say no, you want to do more.

154
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,760
Don't you think that's why
 we're on fire all of a sudden?

155
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,600
Then what? If our moms approve 
of us, would our love get cold?

156
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,910
It'd get cold all of a sudden.

157
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,110
Mr. Makjang!

158
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,860
Kidding. I'm kidding.

159
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,100
Hae Deun, show me your face.

160
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,530
You're hiding your pretty face.

161
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,830
 I can't. I'm a mess right now. 

162
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,770
Oh, you're always a mess, Director Lee.

163
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,280
That's your charm. Being messy.

164
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,560
What?

165
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,130
 Really. I'm really joking. 

166
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,200
 What? 

167
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,260
No, no. That's not it. Behind you.

168
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,870
 - Why?
- Is it Hae Deun? 

169
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,180
Oh, my God!

170
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Oh, no! It hung up! What do I do now?

171
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
Gosh, it hung up! What do I do?

172
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,420
Aigoo, aigoo...

173
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,620
This is unbelievable.

174
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,080
How many hours has it been
 since you saw Hae Deun?

175
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,540
Hey, do you like Hae Deun that much?

176
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,920
Yes.

177
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,400
Aigoo, hate you, Jang Joon Ah.

178
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,520
You make me a villain.

179
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,810
My apologies.

180
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,440
Hey, you. How can you laugh?

181
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,320
My gosh. You!

182
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,150
Mom.

183
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,420
This is so weird.

184
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,000
The strange thing is, Mom...

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,080
There was a distance 
between you and me before.

186
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
But ever since you started opposing
 my relationship with Hae Deun,

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,980
should I say we're less proper 
as a mom and son?

188
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,480
I think we're less distant.

189
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,890
Could this a good sign?

190
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,820
Yeah, it's a good sign.

191
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,380
I'm happy that it's a good sign, but

192
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,250
I can't approve of your relationship.

193
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,960
Geez, Mom.

194
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,070
Please give us your approval.

195
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,040
Aigoo, seriously.

196
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,220
I came in here to enjoy 
some fruit with you.

197
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,750
- Forget it.
- Mom, we can eat fruit together.

198
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,110
Should I call Seo Ah, too? 
Where is she?

199
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,330
Is she not home yet?

200
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,010
Seo Ah isn't home yet.

201
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,910
Really?

202
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,610
This girl. This older brother
 is staying home.

203
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,950
This is no good. I'll try calling her.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,040
Really.

205
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,600
 

206
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,780
You should be happy with this.

207
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,890
Director Jang Seo Ah.

208
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,090
You must love 
Hwang Na Ro immensely.

209
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,510
This amount tells me that.

210
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,100
I can't give you any more.

211
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,820
That's the end of it.

212
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,840
It's too bad to end it like this.

213
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
This makes me think...

214
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,960
that you can afford to be 
more generous, Director Jang.

215
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,680
Come on, be more generous.

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,430
If you...

217
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,580
keep this up, do you think I'd stay put?

218
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,020
Don't stay put.

219
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,550
But instead...

220
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,090
you won't be able to see 
Na Ro for a long time.

221
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,800
He has to go to prison.

222
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,800
I know lots of ways...

223
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,120
I could put away
 Hwang Na Ro behind bars.

224
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,840
Why don't you try me?

225
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,180
I asked Ttak Bae and the guys...

226
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,290
 
and that a**hole Prof. Kim 
has a dazzling list of crimes

227
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,340
enough to put him behind bars.

228
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,370
But the problem is that...

229
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,330
this jerk doesn't leave 
behind any evidence.

230
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,780
I might need these guys' testimonies.

231
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,820
Nope.

232
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,830
I won't get involved.

233
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,890
I helped you this much, 
so you take care of the rest.

234
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,350
Geez, Hyungnim.

235
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,720
These guys obey anything you say.

236
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,080
While you're at it, help me out 
to the end. Please?

237
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,510
No, I don't want to.

238
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,330
My Seo Yeon told me not to 
get involved in stuff like this.

239
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
But aren't you hot, Hyungnim?

240
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,390
Why are you wearing 
a jacket like that inside?

241
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm not hot.

242
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,790
I'll never take this off.

243
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,280
Geez, go for it.

244
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,450
Attention!

245
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,670
Attention!

246
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,030
At rest!

247
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,350
At rest!

248
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,470
Forward, march!

249
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,610
March!

250
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,050
- Left.
- Left.

251
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,500
- Left.
- Left.

252
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,130
- Left.
- Left.

253
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,620
- Left.
- Left.

254
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,970
- Left.
- Left...

255
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,250
I'm freezing. Let's go inside.

256
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,530
Come on now. Is this all you can do?

257
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,550
It's freezing. Let's go inside.

258
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,860
Okay, fine. I'll give in today.

259
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,480
- Let's go inside.
- Let's go.

260
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,880
Wait, wait, wait.

261
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,770
Let's hug for a minute.

262
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,170
Gosh, each and every day
 goes by too fast.

263
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,520
It's too bad.

264
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,690
Let's think far ahead.

265
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,020
I'm one day closer to 
being discharged!

266
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,030
Huh?

267
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,450
What? You haven't even enlisted yet.

268
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,710
I'm saying let's be positive.

269
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,460
Let's go inside.

270
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,970
- Oh, let's hug one more time.
- Let's.

271
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,900
It's freezing. Let's go in.

272
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,070
- It's cold.
- What the heck?

273
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,140
- Let's go.
- Daebak.

274
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,730
- Left.
- Left.

275
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,980
Why do we keep starting 
with the left foot?

276
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,740
 I'm telling you to start with the left foot. 

277
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,010
 You're doing fine. 

278
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,180
Who are you?

279
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,550
Oh, Eun Ji.

280
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,280
Did you get discharged already?

281
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,870
Yes. Hello.

282
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,500
So...

283
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,390
Oh, you're here to see Hwak Se.

284
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,730
Oh, no. I was just passing by.

285
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,790
What do you mean? Let's go inside.

286
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,180
- No, no.
- What?

287
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,440
Pardon me.

288
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,480
 Unni, you came in first. 

289
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,790
Unni.

290
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,080
Hi, Man Jung. You're home.

291
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,610
Gosh, it was tough working
 the night shift, huh?

292
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,490
- Unni.
- Huh?

293
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,920
Tell me honestly.

294
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,730
About what?

295
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,590
Eun Ji.

296
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,690
Oh, my God!

297
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,670
What? You're saying Eun Ji is
 Ra Hoon's birth mom?

298
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,140
It's not definite yet.

299
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,020
You know, back then...

300
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,850
between two boys who 
came to Sunny Orphanage,

301
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,720
one of them lives overseas.

302
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,170
So she came to see Ra Hoon first.

303
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,480
No wonder. I thought it was weird.

304
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,660
I thought it was weird that you went
 to the hospital with me.

305
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,500
And why would she cry her eyes out 
in front of a stranger?

306
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,390
Unni, what's going on here?

307
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,880
That's what I'm saying.

308
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,470
But...

309
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,260
was Eun Ji standing 
in front of our house?

310
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,180
Yeah.

311
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,730
She was staring into 
our house like this.

312
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,570
Gosh.

313
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,880
I guess she missed Ra Hoon very  much.

314
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,360
But why did she decide to show up now?

315
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,520
I heard she's never been married.

316
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,710
I know.

317
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,940
I wonder if something happened to her.

318
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,620
Hey, did the doctors tell you anything?

319
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,540
As for the hospital, that's the 
patient's personal information.

320
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,070
There's a limit to what they can find out.

321
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,460
My gosh.

322
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,110
In any case...

323
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,980
we don't know anything for sure.

324
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,200
Keep this as a secret with the family.

325
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,070
Especially with Ra Hoon.

326
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,080
Of course.

327
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,960
Even for Chae Woon, 
before she met Jung Won unni,

328
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,990
she received so many calls saying
 they're her birth parents.

329
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,700
When they weren't her parents, 
she used to get

330
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,630
so hurt because of it.

331
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,090
That's right.

332
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,300
That had happened.

333
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,500
What now?

334
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,110
- Unni.
- What?

335
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,630
Then...

336
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,680
who's his dad?

337
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,870
Dad... Who knows?

338
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,350
By chance...

339
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,810
By chance, who?

340
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,750
By chance...

341
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,740
In my time...

342
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,620
the military used to be so tough.

343
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,920
Compared to that,

344
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,210
it's like being in heaven now.

345
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,100
Geez, what heaven?

346
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,000
Guys told me that's now how it is.

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,530
Well... Oh, really?

348
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,870
Yeah, right. It's kind of a crapshoot.

349
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,160
The kind of senior you meet

350
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,350
will determine if your military life
 will be a rollercoaster ride.

351
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,100
Hey, Ra Hoon, you should 
have at least one talent.

352
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,290
You...

353
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,750
Hey, you're a good singer. You can sing.

354
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,130
Sing a song. A dance song. Dance.

355
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,030
Geez, why sing a song all of a sudden?

356
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,060
I won't. I can't.

357
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,580
Try to sing right now.

358
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,190
There are lots of talent shows.

359
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,350
I'll fix it for you, so your 
superiors would like it. Try it.

360
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,900
- Into the style they'd like. 
- Yup.

361
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,200
- Okay!
- Okay.

362
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,300
- I'll try it.
- Okay.

363
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,820
Great.

364
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,310
♫   It's good! It's good! It's good!   ♫

365
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,370
♫   It's very, very good   ♫

366
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:30,850
Pass!

367
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,340
♫   It's perfect! It's perfect! It's perfect!  ♫

368
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,160
♫  You're truly perfect   ♫
Hey, you.

369
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,290
Tomorrow night.

370
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,730
♫   When you ask for love, it's okay!  ♫

371
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,800
♫  Okay!  ♫

372
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,720
♫   Even when you whine, it's okay!   ♫

373
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,000
♫  Okay!  ♫

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,090
♫  You're very...  ♫
Auntie.

375
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,220
- Hwak Se.
- Auntie.

376
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,680
Jjung-a, when did you get home?

377
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,900
Are you doing a duet now?

378
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,370
No, no.

379
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,470
That's not it.

380
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,290
I was giving Ra Hoon some pointers
 for surviving in the military.

381
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,570
This is...

382
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,280
Wow, seriously!

383
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,910
I don't feel like I'm sending 
a nephew to the military.

384
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,560
I feel like I'm sending a son.

385
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,310
Father!

386
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,400
Son!

387
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,470
Good luck, man!

388
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,300
- I'll be good!
- Son!

389
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,750
Hey, sing a song.

390
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,490
♫   Even when you whine, it's okay!   ♫

391
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,490
♫  Okay!  ♫

392
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,520
Look, do that tomorrow night.

393
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,480
- Really?
- You're a great singer.

394
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,100
I don't know how to thank you.

395
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,950
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,750
Gosh, no.

397
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,550
Don't keep saying that.

398
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,750
I'm so grateful.

399
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,970
While leaving Ba Wi alone at home,

400
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,410
I'd get anxious and get into 
accidents while driving.

401
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,360
I've done that several times.

402
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,780
Parents all feel that way.

403
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,200
Ba Wi will get cold.

404
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,350
Hurry. Go inside.

405
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,270
- Okay.
- Yes.

406
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,280
- Goodnight, Noonim.
- Yes. Goodnight.

407
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,750
Okay, let's go.

408
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,020
Gosh...

409
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,390
Both Woo Jung Hoo and Son Jung Hoo...

410
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,550
Why do they make me feel so sad?

411
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,570
Gosh.

412
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,960
I can't get soft just because
 I feel sorry for them.

413
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,660
I feel sad.

414
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,710
- Hello!
- Good morning.

415
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

416
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,020
 Add more personnel? 

417
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,180
For the smart clothing project team?

418
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,270
Yeah.

419
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,470
I guess they're accepting 
applications from current employees.

420
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,700
Regardless of whether you're
 full-time or on contract.

421
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,720
It says it's a plus if the applicant 
can be a stylist as well.

422
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,510
It must be because the CEO 
launched the new project

423
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,250
 
and has lots of outside functions.

424
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,500
If you're the stylist,

425
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,200
you have to work with
 the CEO constantly, right?

426
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,630
Gosh, I'd be too nervous. I can't do it.

427
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,400
Me neither.

428
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,330
Then it's mine!

429
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,430
No. I meant, good morning.

430
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,670
Hello!

431
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,900
Good morning.

432
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,130
So you're going to apply for
 the smart clothing team?

433
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,980
Yeah.

434
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,330
If the applicant has to be a stylist, too,

435
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,010
it means I'm the prime candidate.

436
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,130
No.

437
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,390
I don't think my mom will pick you.

438
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,240
But I still should go for it.

439
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,850
Let's not be downcast just because
 our moms oppose us.

440
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,430
Let's be proactive.

441
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,180
- Proactive?
- Yeah.

442
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,380
Proactive.

443
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,670
Whoa...

444
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,850
Then I have to work on your mother, huh?

445
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,560
Great!

446
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,760
Then we'll each go and 
cross-mark each other's moms.

447
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,560
Yeah, but what's wrong with
 your pronunciation?

448
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,400
- Cross-mark?
- Cross-mark.

449
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,990
Watch your "mark." Mark.

450
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,650
- Mark Jang?
- Mark, mark.

451
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,660
Then I'll go inside Samgwang 
Villa starting today.

452
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,960
- Yes, sounds good. Great!
- Yes!

453
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,940
Let's go.

454
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,080
- Go? Now?
- Go.

455
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,410
Go where?

456
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,650
What? Who are you?

457
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,550
Oh, my.

458
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,710
Joon Ah.

459
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,180
- Mother.
- What are you doing?

460
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,310
Aren't you going to work?

461
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,420
I finished urgent matters at work.

462
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,920
I came to help you, Mother.

463
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,800
I swept in front of the house.

464
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,610
- Let me go into the yard.
- Wait, why are you doing this?

465
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,970
- Sweep the yard.
- Joon Ah.

466
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,100
So many leaves.

467
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,920
Joon Ah, why are you doing this?

468
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,450
Geez...

469
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,030
It looks like you changed your strategy.

470
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,470
I won't change my mind
 because you're doing this.

471
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,410
Aigoo.

472
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,530
Don't upset your mother later.

473
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,130
Hurry up and go! Go.

474
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,560
Mother, I'm not here to
 change your mind.

475
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,840
I came to discipline my heart and mind.

476
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,650
Just think that for me, Mother.

477
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,100
Why are there so many leaves?

478
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,560
- Joon Ah.
- Yes?

479
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,170
- No. (sounds like eye drops)
- Do you need eye drops?

480
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,780
Aigoo! This isn't it.

481
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,020
Aigoo...

482
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,780
I won't change even if you do this.

483
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,580
Hurry up and leave. 
Don't put me in a bind later.

484
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,460
- Let me sweep the yard.
- No!

485
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,010
- Hurry up and leave!
- Mother, let me sweep the yard.

486
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,630
Mother...

487
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,220
Mother! Mother!

488
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,880
Joon Ah, leave.

489
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,080
I'm sorry. I have no choice.

490
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,820
Come over for a visit with your mother.

491
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,370
Hurry up and leave. Go.

492
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,770
Mother, let me sweep just once.

493
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,600
- Mother, can I come in?
- Hurry, leave!

494
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,780
Mother! I'm coming in. I'll go in, Mother.

495
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,150
Mother, seriously.

496
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,370
I'm coming in, Mother.

497
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,160
I can fly. Mother!

498
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,390
You said you wanted a blind test.

499
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,510
So I didn't indicate names.

500
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,780
That's how it should be.

501
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,640
We must be fair.

502
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,990
All three of them are 
our employees, right?

503
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,000
Yes.

504
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,840
If you're not satisfied with what you see,

505
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,710
I'll ask HR to recruit.

506
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,910
No, no.

507
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,950
There's one applicant that I totally love.

508
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,410
Number three.

509
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,690
Okay.

510
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,640
Should I tell her to come in now?

511
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,370
All three applicants are waiting outside.

512
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,110
Yeah, sure. Let me meet
 the applicant right away.

513
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,340
- I'm in a rush.
- Okay.

514
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,050
Applicant number three, come in.

515
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,160
Hello, CEO!

516
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,450
Lee Hae Deun, what brings you here?

517
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,130
She's applicant number three.

518
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,330
How did you know about this...

519
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,890
Even as a contractor,

520
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,210
you've given me a chance 
and selected me fairly.

521
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,800
I thank you so much!

522
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,690
I'll really work hard, CEO.

523
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,920
No.

524
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,450
I won't pick you, Lee Hae Deun.

525
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,560
Please leave.

526
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,750
Didn't you ask me to come in
 because you liked my portfolio?

527
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,300
I did, but...

528
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,500
I didn't know it was you.

529
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,840
Please leave.

530
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,390
- Ms. Goo.
- Wait a minute, CEO.

531
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,010
I'll really work hard. 
Please give me a chance.

532
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,820
Hae Deun.

533
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,100
Can't you separate business
 from personal matters?

534
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,960
You're behaving this way intentionally

535
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,470
because you want me to approve 
your relationship with Joon Ah.

536
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,070
I can't accept this.

537
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,490
CEO...

538
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,070
Hae Deun.

539
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,190
What do I do...

540
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,560
 Mr. Makjang. 

541
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,990
 How did it go at my house? 

542
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,340
Mr. Makjang!

543
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,850
Director Lee, your mother
 kicked me out.

544
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,010
How about you?

545
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,680
Me, too...

546
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,880
You, too?

547
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,430
Must we be discouraged like this?

548
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,930
 Geez, maybe we're not 
meant to be, Hae Deun... 

549
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,320
If we're not, we have to make it so.

550
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,070
How?

551
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,280
Mr. Makjang, let's meet in an hour.

552
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,300
Huh? Out of the blue?

553
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,570
- Mr. Makjang.
- Yeah?

554
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,140
Do you love me?

555
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,460
Of course, I love you. 
I can't live without you.

556
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,890
But why are we at city hall?

557
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,790
Once our mothers approve us,

558
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,150
are you going to marry me?

559
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,820
Of course, I'll marry you.

560
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,210
That's why we're going through all this.

561
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,660
Then let's do it now.

562
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,250
What?

563
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,710
Do what?

564
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,730
Get married. Register our marriage.

565
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,580
Huh?

566
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,180
Register our marriage?

567
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,450
The way I look at it,

568
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,520
I don't think our mothers 
will ever approve.

569
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,250
Then we'll get frustrated and give up.

570
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,500
So let's just do it and 
get their approval.

571
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,120
But still...

572
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,360
Why? Are you scared?

573
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,430
Is this all there is to our love?

574
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,930
No, not like that. I'm not scared.

575
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,450
But to register our marriage
 is just too sudden.

576
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,750
This is huge, Hae Deun.

577
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,920
Yeah. That's true.

578
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,150
Since you don't have the courage,

579
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,810
let's forget about it, and let's go.

580
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,310
Wait!

581
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,820
What's with you?

582
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,480
You told me to meet you in an
 hour and brought me here.

583
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,310
Didn't you settle this in your heart 
when you came here?

584
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,890
Wait. Let me just think.

585
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,190
- Let me think...
- Yeah, let's think...

586
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,380
- All right, let's go.
- Wait, wait!

587
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,590
Five... five...

588
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,990
Shall we think about this 
for five more minutes?

589
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,540
- Well, this is too sudden...
- Let's go.

590
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,790
Come to think of it, and I guess
 we came too impulsively.

591
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,860
Should we grab coffee?

592
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,830
Why is your hand trembling? 
Don't tremble.

593
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,800
Your whole body is trembling. 
It's okay. Just trust me.

594
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,260
It's... it's okay.

595
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,970
- Lee...
- Hae Deun.

596
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,540
Yeah, right.

597
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,250
- Bon.
- Bon.
(It means clan)

598
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,230
What's "bon"?

599
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,930
Bon. Ah, that's it. They mean "bone."

600
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,900
- Huh?
- It means "bone."

601
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,290
I guess you don't know, Hae Deun.

602
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,930
I'll teach you. I studied overseas.

603
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,280
 
Bone. Write down "bone" in Korean.

604
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,110
What are you talking about? That's wrong.

605
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,420
It's not?

606
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,590
It's not.

607
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,770
- You have to write down your clan.
- Excuse me!

608
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,160
Here you go.

609
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,590
Okay.

610
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,470
It's been submitted.

611
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,870
- How much is it?
- How long should we wait?

612
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,660
No, how much? We have to pay.

613
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,850
We have to pay?

614
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,250
You're done.

615
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,670
- Pardon?
- No pay?

616
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,950
Done?

617
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,920
Done? Are we a married couple then?

618
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,440
Congrats on getting married.

619
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,390
I can call her "dear" now?

620
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,450
- No, you can't.
- Why not?

621
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,670
- We're married now.
- This is it?

622
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,120
- Let's go. We're a bother.
 - It's this easy?

623
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,930
- Bye. 
- It's too quick.

624
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,380
"We just got our marriage license."

625
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,040
You have to take the 
picture with the writing.

626
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,160
Like this?

627
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,030
Pose a good angle.

628
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,030
- Slightly.
- Congratulations.

629
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,410
Thank you.

630
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,870
Come on.

631
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,730
- People keep looking.
- Marriage license, heart.

632
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,430
One, two, three.

633
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,560
 

634
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,700
What's with this?

635
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,570
See? It's a bad omen.

636
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,080
We did the right thing, right?

637
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,000
We did the right thing. 
Why did that fall over?

638
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,170
Good. Good. We did well.

639
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,720
In any case, we can't undo it.

640
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,520
Well, we did get married after all.

641
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,370
Shouldn't we go and eat 
together or something?

642
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,040
No. Hae Deun, no.

643
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,650
It's an important day that we 
registered our marriage. Right?

644
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,910
To be accountable for our actions,

645
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,040
we need to be faithful to our duties.

646
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,360
What duty?

647
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,230
We should go to our moms 
and keep cross-mark.

648
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,780
Again?

649
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,280
We must, no matter what.

650
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,770
We filed our paperwork.

651
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,840
So no matter how much 
our moms persecute us,

652
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,570
we can be brave and stand our ground.

653
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,730
Got it?

654
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,410
As for our celebration,

655
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,390
let's do it after we get our blessings. 
What do you think?

656
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,680
Sounds great.

657
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,560
Before we get a seal of 
approval from our moms,

658
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,630
we must keep our marriage
 license a secret.

659
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,780
We must keep it a secret.

660
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,450
If my mom finds out, she'll faint.

661
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,220
- Really.
- My mom, too.

662
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,360
CEO.

663
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,010
Did you see the expressions 
on the executives' faces?

664
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,370
Everyone was satisfied today.

665
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,400
I know.

666
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,350
Managing Director Jang also showed

667
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,450
quite an interest in building
 a research complex.

668
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,980
I think Hwang Na Ro's refreshing
 vision on smart clothing

669
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,640
and golf apparel collaboration
 was quite effective.

670
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,680
Your presentation today was excellent.

671
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,510
Thank you, CEO.

672
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,200
I got lots of help from Bit Chae Woon

673
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,150
as far as expanding and 
utilizing my ideas.

674
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,440
Good job to you, too, Bit Chae Woon.

675
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,490
I look forward to more of 
your work in the future.

676
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,280
I'll do my best.

677
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,780
I have another meeting offsite.

678
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,760
Oh, Mom.

679
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,870
Huh?

680
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,220
Our presentation was a success and...

681
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,360
to celebrate...

682
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,970
could we all have dinner
 together as a family?

683
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,020
Including Na Ro.

684
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,180
Please?

685
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,840
Call Joon Ah, too.

686
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,880
Mom.

687
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,640
Thank you.

688
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,140
Eun Ji, are you feeling better?

689
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,070
Yes.

690
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,960
Eun Ji, you must be frail.

691
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,470
You should eat well.

692
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,960
Yes.

693
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,390
Actually...

694
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,440
I was very sick about two years ago.

695
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,290
Is that so?

696
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,070
How sick were you?

697
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,070
I had a tumor in my brain.

698
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,760
Oh, my goodness.

699
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,250
How about now?

700
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,170
Are you better now?

701
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,900
Yes.

702
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,630
After the surgery,

703
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,400
I got better after chemotherapy.

704
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,850
That's why...

705
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,440
I came up with the idea of

706
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,120
meeting my baby.

707
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,350
After...

708
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,870
being terribly ill,

709
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,060
I realized that I'd never know 
when I'll leave this world.

710
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,310
I couldn't even fathom all this time 
because I felt so shameful.

711
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,350
Even though from afar...

712
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,060
even if it's just once...

713
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,440
I started thinking that 
I should meet my baby.

714
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,010
Gosh, that's what happened.

715
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,920
You should've come sooner.

716
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,500
While being sick for so long alone,

717
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,510
it must've been so hard, 
and you must've been so lonely.

718
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,030
I'm sorry.

719
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,190
It's okay.

720
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,960
You know, Eun Ji.

721
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,770
The reason I came here is that...

722
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,420
I thought it'd be good

723
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,320
if you and Ra Hoon took 
a parentage test.

724
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,530
Oh, no.

725
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,220
No, how can I do that?

726
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,390
But still...

727
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,770
If Ra Hoon is your biological son,

728
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,940
shouldn't you find out, Eun Ji?

729
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,120
If that's true, we should tell 
Ra Hoon as well.

730
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,100
No, how can I...

731
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,260
How can I do that?

732
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,880
No, Ms. Lee. That's...

733
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,720
Even if the test says I'm his birth mom,

734
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,130
I won't come forward as Ra Hoon's mom.

735
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:19,290
I came here only to see him 
from afar. So...

736
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,460
please don't tell Ra Hoon.

737
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,100
Such a baby...

738
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,150
I abandoned a baby like that...

739
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,400
How can I dare...

740
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,670
Please don't tell him. I beg you.

741
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,250
Mom!

742
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,860
Hi, Ra Hoon.

743
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,580
What are you doing here?

744
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,540
Of course, I knew you'd be here.

745
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,570
- Hello.
- Hi.

746
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,900
Hey, Ra Hoon.

747
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,860
- What's going on?
- Huh?

748
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,470
I was on my way to work, but I thought
 you might be here.

749
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,700
Joon Ah hyung said you didn't go far.

750
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,300
- Mom.
- Huh?

751
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,060
I wanted to give you this.

752
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,210
- What's this?
- My salary.

753
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,810
I wanted to give it to you at home, 
but you weren't there.

754
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,110
Why are you giving this to me?

755
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,940
I've never given it to you before.

756
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,260
What do you mean never?

757
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,720
When you first started working...

758
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,440
Where was that? The place that 
paid you the most.

759
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,870
- Ah, the rice cake place!
- That's right!

760
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,520
You gave me all the pay 
for your first month.

761
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,410
Hey, put this away.

762
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,640
Before you enlist, you'll need
 money to spend

763
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,160
when you meet friends.

764
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,880
Geez, Mom. I already put 
some away for that.

765
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,590
- Hey, gosh, no.
- My beloved mother.

766
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,010
No.

767
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,940
- Ra Hoon.
- I'm off!

768
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,350
- Look out for cars.
- Okay!

769
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,800
My goodness.

770
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,220
Aigoo...

771
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,750
Ra Hoon must be going to the military?

772
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,230
Yes. Soon.

773
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,280
I see.

774
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,040
 Father! 

775
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
 Son! 

776
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,710
 Good luck! 

777
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,190
They look similar.

778
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,520
Eyes...

779
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,140
Nose...

780
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,590
Mouth.

781
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,080
Their voice sounds the same. 
Their voice...

782
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,720
Their complexions have a similar tone.

783
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,210
They look similar. 
They look exactly the same.

784
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,230
Aigoo. That was close.

785
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,040
Wait a minute.

786
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,150
Seo Yeon found out already.

787
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,060
There's no need to hide out like this.

788
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,380
Excuse me.

789
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,860
Soon Jung.

790
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,190
Oh, my.

791
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,060
Park Pil Hong.

792
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,610
What brings you here?

793
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,530
- Did something happen?
- No.

794
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,110
I...

795
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,200
What in the world...

796
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,620
My gosh.

797
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,480
This is the place...

798
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,110
that Hae Deun couldn't say enough
 about the sewing skills.

799
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,870
Yes, your younger daughter 
came by to fix her top.

800
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:03,390
So my Chae Woon doesn't 
know yet, right?

801
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,180
Does she know?

802
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,820
Chae Woon was fine 
when she found out?

803
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,630
No.

804
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,290
Aigoo...

805
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,870
Gosh, what do we do about this?

806
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,740
Come on, Park Pil Hong.

807
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,550
Why did you have to 
open up your store here?

808
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,240
What did Chae Woon say to you?

809
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,030
She's very upset, right?

810
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,490
I didn't get to speak to her in person.

811
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,870
She left me this.

812
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,150
Oh, my.

813
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,080
Re... really?

814
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,090
And who else knows about this?

815
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,950
Jae Hee fixed the ceiling for me.

816
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,590
And his father knows as well.

817
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,960
Oh, my.

818
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,350
Gosh.

819
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,790
That means everyone knows!

820
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,460
You can't really say that.

821
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,170
My Jung Won doesn't know yet.

822
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,920
Gosh, seriously.

823
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,700
Gosh, I'll have nothing to do with this.

824
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,790
CEO comes over to our house 
often these days, to begin with.

825
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,420
My goodness...

826
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,120
What do I tell her?

827
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,810
But I got past Seo Yeon, 
my formidable obstacle.

828
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,420
My Jung Won wouldn't 
kill me, would she?

829
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,980
Gosh...

830
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,510
Gosh, my head...

831
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,790
It's good. The flour tteok is tasty.

832
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,300
Isn't it too spicy, Mother?

833
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,940
Well...

834
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,380
I like spicy food.

835
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,310
- I see. You like it.
- You can't?

836
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,150
I do, but this is too...

837
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,710
But you know...

838
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,100
why don't you ask me? 
Aren't you curious?

839
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,020
About what?

840
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,060
You know...

841
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,330
between Jae Hee's father and me...

842
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,720
You know how Jae Hee's father 
said he has a girlfriend

843
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,710
and told me to fly away. 
That incident.

844
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,820
Oh, that...

845
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,840
Aren't you curious?

846
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,400
What's going on with Professor Son
 across the hallway and me...

847
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,890
What will she do in the future? Right?

848
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,930
A little bit. Just a little.

849
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,120
I don't think so. I think 
you're extremely curious.

850
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,500
A little bit. A lot.

851
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,480
But I don't feel like...

852
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,920
you're ready to make
 some type of decision.

853
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,090
That's why I couldn't really ask you.

854
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,850
Of course. You know exactly 
how I feel, Chae Woon!

855
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,100
You know?

856
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,570
You're right. Actually, I feel that...

857
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,070
I don't really know how I feel right now.

858
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,840
"Should I just get together with 
a young, handsome man

859
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,920
and get remarried?"

860
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,460
And at the same time...

861
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,480
"No, it took so much to 
obtain this freedom.

862
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,390
I should enjoy my life."

863
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,920
I think that, too.

864
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,180
Anyway, that Woo Jung Hoo...

865
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,470
I wish he'd stop pushing
 me away like crazy.

866
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,530
But I could understand why Father 
would do that to you, though.

867
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,340
It's because he feels awful toward me
 about our life together.

868
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,060
I know that, too.

869
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,300
I thought everything would be
 over once we parted.

870
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,090
But this questionable 
emotion gets in the way.

871
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,490
What could this be?

872
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,900
How silly of me.

873
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,060
I can't believe I'm telling you all this.

874
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,990
So what? I'm happy to
 hear about all this.

875
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,500
I feel like you're a friend 
and a daughter.

876
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,700
- I'm so happy, too.
- Thank you.

877
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,100
Oh, right.

878
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,990
Your birthday is coming up soon.

879
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,870
It's your first birthday
 since we got married.

880
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,460
I'd like to prepare your birthday meal. 
What do you think?

881
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,470
You even came up with such an idea?

882
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,120
I'm so grateful.

883
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,630
It's nice to have a daughter-in-law.

884
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,090
But...

885
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,850
I'd like to spend this birthday alone.

886
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,530
How come?

887
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:05,130
It's my first birthday being independent.

888
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,420
It's quite meaningful for me.

889
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,100
I'd like to spend it alone as 
I evaluate being independent.

890
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,010
And I'd like to mull over some thoughts.

891
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,260
I'd like to do that.

892
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,840
 Seo Yeon! 

893
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
 Seo Yeon! 

894
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,890
Geez, Father...

895
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,980
I try not to think about him, 
but he won't let me.

896
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,760
- Father.
- Hi, Jae Hee.

897
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,750
We'll get going then, Hyungnim.

898
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,380
Okay. Bye.

899
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,320
Wait...

900
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,440
Father, did you start 
something shady again?

901
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,730
No, it's not like that.

902
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,250
If that's not the case, why are men...

903
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,980
Why do men looking like 
this come and go?

904
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,330
Geez, they just look scuzzy.

905
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,450
They're good at heart.

906
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,660
Father.

907
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,510
Well, Seo Yeon asked me to find out 
what Hwang Na Ro is up to.

908
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,530
Aigoo. She told me not 
to say this to you.

909
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,480
Chae Woon asked you to do that?

910
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,760
Why?

911
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,060
She said my Jung Won is very 
concerned about Hwang Na Ro.

912
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,280
I heard Jang Seo Ah is dating
 Hwang Na Ro without thinking twice.

913
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,710
But why...

914
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,230
Why do you keep getting in 
touch with guys like this?

915
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,540
Actually, I think Hwang Na Ro is 
getting blackmailed.

916
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,930
Knowing that Hwang Na Ro is dating 
a daughter of a wealthy family,

917
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,480
there's a jerk who keeps coming 
around for some bread crumbs.

918
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,970
He's called "Prof. Kim."

919
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,200
- Prof. Kim?
- Yeah.

920
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,980
Hi, Chae Woon.

921
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,360
Seo Yeon!

922
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,870
Today?

923
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,750
Yeah, we're getting together 
at Mom's house tonight.

924
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,690
We were going to celebrate the 
successful launching of our project,

925
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,490
but it turned out to be a family gathering.

926
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,020
Jae Hee, do you have time for it?

927
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,480
I'll make time.

928
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,290
Everyone is getting together 
at your mother's house.

929
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,480
Seo Yeon, thanks for the jacket!

930
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,740
Thank you!

931
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,690
Are you at the repair shop again?

932
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,500
Yeah, well...

933
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,070
I was passing by.

934
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,290
- Should I put Father on the phone?
- Yeah, let me talk.

935
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,030
No, it's okay.

936
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,510
See you at my mom's place.
 I'm hanging up.

937
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,990
Okay.

938
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,610
It hung up.

939
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,140
She hung up?

940
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,250
- Seo Yeon, welcome!
- Mom!

941
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,160
Welcome, Jae Hee. No...

942
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,470
He's my son-in-law now.

943
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,230
- Welcome.
- Hello, Mother.

944
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,710
- Hi.
- Mom.

945
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,260
Na Ro is here, too.

946
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,840
- Hi, you came.
- Hi.

947
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,550
- Mom!
- Hi, Joon Ah.

948
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,790
Whoa, brother-in-law.

949
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,100
- Hi, you came.
- Jang Joon Ah, how have you been?

950
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,260
Stop calling me by name. 
I'm your wife's older brother.

951
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,970
You should call me "hyungnim." 
Say, hyungnim.

952
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,510
What hyungnim? He wants to die.

953
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,180
Hello, Brother-in-law.

954
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,520
Hi, Hae Deun, you came.

955
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,260
Hello, CEO.

956
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,940
What brings you here, Hae Deun?

957
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,650
Hae Deun is my wife... well... um...

958
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,990
Because she's my girlfriend.

959
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,220
I heard it's a work meeting 
as well as a family gathering.

960
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
I came as Joon Ah's girlfriend,
 my unni's younger sister,

961
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,790
and as a smart clothing team member.

962
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,400
I haven't decided on you yet, though.

963
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,940
Ah, well, Chief Goo said that...

964
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,350
you'll keep an eye on me, so...

965
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,470
I'm glad you came, Hae Deun.

966
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,160
Okay, since you're here, 
eat dinner before you go.

967
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,960
Thank you, CEO!

968
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,740
Aigoo, really.

969
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,960
Relax while I get things ready.

970
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,120
Okay.

971
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,320
What?

972
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,680
We wanted to help you, Mom.

973
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,330
Gosh, forget it.

974
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,400
- Gosh.
- Don't come.

975
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,920
Chae Woon, talk to me for a minute.

976
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:40,950
I heard that you asked your father to find 
out if Hwang Na Ro is plotting something.

977
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,980
Did Park Pil Hong tell you that?

978
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,450
You should've discussed it with me first.

979
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,670
Well...

980
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,070
Since Mom is so worried about Seo Ah,

981
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,330
I felt so rushed...

982
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,060
And I didn't feel comfortable talking
 to you about Park Pil Hong.

983
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,840
Gosh...

984
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,420
You promised to talk to me about
 everything from now on.

985
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,710
All right?

986
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,940
All right.

987
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,580
So did he find out anything?

988
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,440
Finding out that Hwang Na Ro 
got close to Seo Ah,

989
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,930
I guess some sleazeballs he used 
to know to keep sticking around.

990
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,440
Asking for money.

991
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,190
I'll talk to Seo Ah before dinner.

992
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,140
Okay.

993
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,340
 What the heck are you talking about? 

994
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,730
 I told you no more. 

995
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,450
Are you blackmailing me right now?

996
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,060
Let's talk later.

997
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,230
Let's go eat dinner.

998
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,040
Seo Ah, are you getting
 blackmailed right now?

999
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,400
It's not like that.

1000
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,640
I heard from Park Pil Hong.

1001
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,240
Someone is threatening Hwang Na Ro
 to rip off some money from him.

1002
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,210
But since Hwang Na Ro won't give in,

1003
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,070
isn't he blackmailing you directly?

1004
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,850
Pretend not to know.

1005
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,360
I can take care of it all.

1006
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,810
What do you mean you'll take care of it? 
You might be in danger, too.

1007
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,400
No.

1008
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,050
Na Ro said there's a way to get this guy.

1009
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,370
We just need to earn some time until then.

1010
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,970
Today is a good day.

1011
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:27,390
Mom invited Na Ro to 
our house for the first time.

1012
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,000
But if Mom finds out about this, 
everything will fall apart again.

1013
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,260
Chae Woon.

1014
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,200
You said you'd help me.

1015
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,450
Turn a blind eye just once. Please?

1016
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,170
How can I turn a blind eye 
after knowing all this?

1017
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,080
You and I are sisters, Seo Ah.

1018
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,400
Because we're sisters,

1019
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,940
please help me out just this once.

1020
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,210
Please?

1021
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,670
What are you two talking about?

1022
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,200
Come out. Let's eat.

1023
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,690
Okay.

1024
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,110
Let's go.

1025
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:11,960
Let's celebrate launching 
our new project

1026
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,240
and to do an excellent job
 in the future.

1027
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,630
Shall we toast?

1028
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:16,460
Yes.

1029
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,890
Let's do a good job.

1030
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,220
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

1031
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,880
I'll work hard, Moth...

1032
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,610
I mean, CEO...

1033
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,700
Hwang Na Ro,

1034
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,950
Seo Ah, and Chae Woon, 
you all worked so hard.

1035
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,670
Especially Hwang Na Ro.

1036
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,830
I heard you met every director
 explaining and persuading.

1037
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,000
Yes.

1038
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,840
You did a fantastic job. Thank you.

1039
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,600
I'll work even harder.

1040
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,930
All right.

1041
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,930
Let's eat.

1042
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,580
Okay. Thank you for this food.

1043
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,650
 Thank you for this food. 

1044
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,840
Eat. Eat this one first, Jae Hee.

1045
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,540
- Okay.
- This is the least tasty one. Eat it.

1046
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,260
Jae Hee, try some dumplings.

1047
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,140
- Okay. Yes.
- It's the least tasty one.

1048
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,210
 Hwang Na Ro. 

1049
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,730
 You're at CEO Kim Jung Won's house, right? 

1050
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,710
 You must be stoked. 

1051
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,070
- Hwang Na Ro.
- Yes?

1052
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,770
Did you get a message?

1053
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:14,380
Oh, it's Chief Yoon. It's about 
the smart clothing issues.

1054
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,570
I don't think so...

1055
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,100
It is.

1056
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,300
I don't think so...

1057
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,270
Eat.

1058
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,800
 
Eat. It's good.

1059
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:29,110
 Your girlfriend Jang Seo Ah
 is pretty gutsy. 

1060
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,810
 I had no idea she was this rich. 

1061
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,050
 I think she'll keep paying me off
 even if I continue to rip her off. 

1062
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,210
Jae Hee, eat this.

1063
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,900
Why aren't you eating?

1064
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,190
- Eat a lot.
- Jae Hee, eat a lot.

1065
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,880
Why aren't you eating much?

1066
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,440
Seo Ah...

1067
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,080
keeps asking me to
 let you two get married.

1068
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,370
How do you feel? 
Do you feel the same way?

1069
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,030
To be honest...

1070
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,370
I'm not too sure.

1071
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,950
Huh?

1072
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,910
As for now...

1073
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:21,800
the fact that I can work 
alongside Seo Ah

1074
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,150
makes me so happy.

1075
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,420
It's also an honor for me to
 be invited to a dinner like this.

1076
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,830
I'm well aware that you're 
not happy about me

1077
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,730
in so many ways.

1078
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,060
Even though I have nothing 
to show for,

1079
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:45,190
but what I can tell you 
confidently is that

1080
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,900
I truly...

1081
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,830
love Seo Ah right now.

1082
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,460
So, even if you disapprove of me,

1083
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,630
I think I'll be all right.

1084
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,940
For once, just like this...

1085
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,200
for Seo Ah...

1086
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,060
I'd like to try my best to my ability.

1087
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,620
Detective, long time no see.

1088
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,780
I'm calling because
 I have something to report.

1089
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,140
So you take turns...

1090
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,710
to make breakfast?

1091
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,950
Yes.

1092
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,690
As for my daughter-in-law

1093
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:03,780
and my son, they are 
both busy working.

1094
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,650
They must love that.

1095
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,340
You must be so happy, Mr. Woo.

1096
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,510
Kids love you as a father.

1097
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,910
Me?

1098
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,100
That's not true.

1099
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,870
I recently reconciled with my son.

1100
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,880
Half of that reconciliation effort

1101
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,180
came from my Chae Woon.

1102
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,100
On the outside, everything 
may look peachy.

1103
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,650
But if you look inside,

1104
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,030
everyone is gloomy...

1105
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,200
and has a story of their own.

1106
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,560
Yes.

1107
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,080
So, sir...

1108
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,340
Gosh.

1109
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,960
Even so, In-law...

1110
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,060
I wish you the best with Chae Woon.

1111
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,400
I'll help you.

1112
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,670
Really?

1113
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,320
Thank you.

1114
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,700
Geez...

1115
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,790
Before it's too late,

1116
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,550
I wanted to be a good
 father to Seo Yeon.

1117
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,190
That's why I opened up 
my store here.

1118
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:05,000
That was my one wish
 I wanted to fulfill before I die.

1119
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,700
I didn't know how precious my family is

1120
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,750
and lived like a loose cannon.

1121
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,180
I deeply wounded my one 
and only daughter.

1122
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,440
 Not know how precious the family is? 

1123
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,950
 That's my story. 

1124
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,290
 Wait. 

1125
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:28,090
 Should I be trying harder for Min Jae? 

1126
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:32,360
 I hurt my precious family the most. 

1127
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,750
Did you make these stuffed animals?

1128
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,070
Yes. I enjoy making stuffed animals.

1129
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,880
I see.

1130
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,640
Wow!

1131
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,690
Is it hard to make this?

1132
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,070
Not at all.

1133
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,890
Do you want me to teach you?

1134
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,340
Really?

1135
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,210
So Prof. Kim got arrested?

1136
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,450
 Yeah, just now. 

1137
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,480
 The guys are going crazy
 because of that. 

1138
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,310
I got it. Good work.

1139
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,120
You should've talked to me last night
 if you wanted to say something.

1140
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,360
What's going on?

1141
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,240
Do you know that Seo Ah is in touch 
with some guy named Prof. Kim?

1142
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,020
I know.

1143
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,920
"I know"?

1144
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,340
You're leaving it alone,
 knowing full well?

1145
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,770
Calm down, Woo Jae Hee.

1146
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,620
That's all been taken care of.

1147
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,920
How?

1148
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,600
Prof. Kim...

1149
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,460
just got arrested.

1150
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,980
When?

1151
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,130
I thought Seo Ah was talking 
to me just last night.

1152
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,760
I just got a call.

1153
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,960
Prof. Kim got arrested by the police.

1154
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,140
Everything has been taken care of.

1155
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,910
So you don't have to worry anymore.

1156
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,130
Then your sins are buried like this, too?

1157
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,640
Sins?

1158
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,630
Exactly what kind of sins?

1159
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,200
I really want to know.

1160
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,640
Do you have anything more to say?

1161
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,530
Then are you really...

1162
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:52,200
Are you really saying that everything
 has been taken care of?

1163
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,310
Bit Chae Woon.

1164
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,210
Give me the benefit of the doubt, 
and believe me for once.

1165
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,480
Isn't it about time you do that?

1166
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,740
If you don't have anything
 else to say, I'll go.

1167
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,180
Hwang Na Ro.

1168
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,620
Are your feelings for Seo Ah genuine?

1169
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,830
Aren't you doing that for money?

1170
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,670
Yeah.

1171
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,860
I understand why you
 wouldn't believe me.

1172
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,130
That's how I behaved, and...

1173
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:28,070
that's what I thought.

1174
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,830
However...

1175
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,970
I'll be different from now on.

1176
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:36,600
And I really want to 
get along with you guys.

1177
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,250
We'll be seeing each other often now.

1178
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,310
Let's get along in the future.

1179
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,320
I'll get going.

1180
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,600
Really?

1181
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,490
Did it really get resolved, Na Ro?

1182
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,670
Yeah.

1183
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:10,170
Everything's been taken care of.

1184
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,030
No one will bother you again, Seo Ah.

1185
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,340
I'm so relieved.

1186
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,800
That's it then.

1187
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,130
Everything's good then.

1188
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,030
I love you.

1189
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,340
I love you, Seo Ah.

1190
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,660
Aigoo...

1191
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,300
All my life...

1192
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,170
the only thing I bought for Min Jae

1193
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,410
was a stuffed animal from the arcade.

1194
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:47,310
I was the worst husband.

1195
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,500
Aigoo...

1196
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:53,500
With a heartfelt apology...

1197
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,840
Ow, that stings.

1198
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,160
Geez, that hurts.

1199
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,580
Ouch...

1200
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,120
It's not easy.

1201
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,780
♫  I can see your heart even
 when you don't speak  ♫

1202
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,740
♫  I can see it in your eyes  ♫

1203
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,010
Geez, that hurts.

1204
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,810
♫  Whether you're happy or sad  ♫

1205
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:36,900
Jung Min Jae said she wants to
 spend her birthday alone.

1206
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,500
I'll just drop this at her front door.

1207
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,100
I hope she doesn't throw it away.

1208
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,470
Wait.

1209
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,160
Should I buy her a cake while I'm at it?

1210
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,020
♫  Your heart that I feel 
at the tip of my fingers  ♫

1211
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,360
♫  I will handle it with care  ♫

1212
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,900
♫  You're like the sunshine that 
shines on me through the fog  ♫

1213
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,370
Chae Woon.

1214
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,920
Father!

1215
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,780
What are you doing here?

1216
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,290
Well, it's Mother's birthday.

1217
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,180
I felt bad just letting it pass.

1218
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,800
I thought I'd drop off 
something small at her door.

1219
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,720
Then I thought, "Should I buy a cake, too?" 
That's why I'm here.

1220
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,630
You, too, Chae Woon?

1221
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,110
- You, too, Father?
- Me, too.

1222
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,510
 Jinx! 

1223
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:30,030
- Should we pick one out together?
- Yes, Father.

1224
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:34,140
♫  You're the only one  ♫

1225
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,160
 Ahjumma, over here! 

1226
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,100
Hi, Ba Wi!

1227
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,100
♫  I can give you my whole heart  ♫

1228
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,420
You came.

1229
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:44,720
Go sit.

1230
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:49,280
Ahjumma, happy birthday!

1231
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,570
My gosh. How did you know
 it's my birthday, Ba Wi?

1232
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:56,210
When you were singing 
a lullaby to me last time.

1233
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,110
You did ask me when
 my birthday was then, right?

1234
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:04,420
Ba Wi kept asking me to
 give you a surprise party.

1235
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,410
 - Thank you, Ba Wi.
- Okay. 

1236
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:10,990
That kiddo Ba Wi. 
Isn't he a bit of a rascal?

1237
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,020
Yes.

1238
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,120
Very much so.

1239
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,920
 All right... 

1240
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:20,110
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

1241
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,150
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

1242
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:26,730
♫  Happy birthday dear Min Jae ahjumma  ♫

1243
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,760
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

1244
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,230
 Ahjumma, happy birthday! 

1245
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:36,840
 Happy birthday, Noonim. 

1246
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,240
Thank you.

1247
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,650
Thanks, Ba Wi.

1248
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,940
Ahjumma, this is my gift.

1249
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,130
Oh, my goodness.

1250
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:48,500
My gosh. This is so pretty!

1251
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,830
Ta-da!

1252
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,330
And this is my gift.

1253
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,870
- Oh, my.
- It's a book of poems.

1254
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,630
I hope you like it.

1255
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,320
Thank you, Professor.

1256
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,820
I love poems.

1257
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,030
She falls asleep within 
a minute of opening a book.

1258
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:10,240
 Ba Wi, your birthday is 
next month, huh? 

1259
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,560
What do you want for your birthday?

1260
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,390
Well, as for me...

1261
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,960
A mom.

1262
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,810
A mom just like you, Ahjumma.

1263
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,170
What?

1264
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,550
What?

1265
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:28,630
Fa... Father...

1266
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:34,770
I want to receive a mom just
 like you as a gift, Ahjumma.

1267
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,020
Geez, Ba Wi.

1268
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:42,200
You must think so 
highly of me, Ba Wi.

1269
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,410
Look at that kid.

1270
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,930
Father! Father!

1271
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,640
Excuse me, young man.

1272
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,700
Grandpa... no...

1273
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,160
Uncle Eems!

1274
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,590
Hi.

1275
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:57,810
Gosh, Jung Hoo.

1276
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,310
Hello.

1277
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,010
I'm sorry for breaking up the party.

1278
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,210
Jung Min Jae, something 
came up with our family.

1279
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,400
What...

1280
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,150
Did Jae Hee once again...

1281
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,000
Please follow me.

1282
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,380
My gosh.

1283
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,520
Professor, something must've
 happened to Jae Hee again.

1284
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,580
I'll get going first.

1285
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,770
Okay. Go ahead.

1286
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:25,380
Ba Wi, thanks. Thanks for the gift.

1287
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,140
Please go ahead.

1288
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:30,100
Ba Wi, thanks for my gift. I'm sorry.

1289
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,380
Ahjumma...

1290
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,690

 Dozed off? It's morning!

01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,540
 I heard Eun Ji came to look for her son. 

1309
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,680
 Hey, Eun Ji. 

1310
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,620
 You had no idea it's Ra Hoon? 

1311
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,880
 Why do you look exactly
 like Ra Hoon, Hwak Se? 

1312
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,920
 - Hwang Na Ro!
- I'm sorry. 

1313
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,850
 I've regretted so much while
 falling in love with Seo Ah. 

1314
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,890
 - From now on...
- Without Seo Ah's knowledge, 

1315
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:51,480
 disappear quietly. Right this minute. 

1316
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,950
 I'm begging you. 

1317
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,380
 Hyungnim, do you know 
where Prof. Kim is right now? 

1318
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,510
 I fell for it. 

1319
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:58,480
 I don't know how that a**hole
 would take revenge. 

1320
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,320
 He could even hurt Bit Chae Woon. 

1321
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,650
 Seo Yeon! 

1322
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,200
♫  I'll give you my all  ♫
