1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,480
It's because...

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,700
I...

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,710
Bit Chae Woon,

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,000
Bit Chae Woon...

5
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,030
I like you.

6
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,460
Don't you have the same feelings for me?

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,930
Don't you?

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,200
I don't. I don't have any feelings for you.

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,770
- You don't know how to read the room! How can you say that at this moment? 
   - Ms. Lee!  

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,630
- Can you check on that thing? 
 - Yes, I'm coming!

11
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,290
Wait, Bit Chae Woon--

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,910
Oh, no, ah!

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,600
Are you okay?

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Ah, headbutt-- no, I mean, Ms. Bit Chae Woon!

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,150
Ah... Ms. Bit Chae Woon!

16
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,200
Oh, my back!

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,100
Can you help... it's hard to do it by myself.

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,470
- Shall we look at the back as well? 
 - Yes.

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,400
     

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,700
      
 - Other than that, I'll give you feedback through email. 
 - Yes.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,000
- Now I have to go back to my office. 
 - Thank you, Ms. Lee.

22
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,040
- You're welcome. 
 - Have a nice day!

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,500
Where did Mr. Woo go? I heard he had a thing to do.

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,200
Wait. So the situation is...

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,790
  I... Bit Chae Woon,  

26
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,000
  I like you.  

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,900
What was that? Did he just confess his feelings towards me?

28
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,300
Was he asking me out?

29
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,030
No, it can't be. This is not right.

30
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,030
Get yourself together, Bit Chae Woon! This can't happen.

31
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,800
It's not okay to be with Koala. No Koala!

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
This is not right.

33
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,530
Mr. Woo! Thank you for your time when you're busy.

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,220
- We can take James to the hospital. 
 - I can do it.

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,980
This is warm water and congee that I made.

36
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,220
James didn't eat anything because he might have a thorough examination.

37
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,200
Is that so? Thank you so much for taking care of him.

38
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,630
Mr. Woo! Did you wait for a long time?

39
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,660
What is...

40
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,400
It's my clothes. He looks so cute.

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,810
- James! You look like a young man! 
 - Do I?

42
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,730
- Does this suit me? 
   - Yes!  

43
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,740
- Well, let's go now. 
 - Ah, yes.

44
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,880
- Then, I'll be back soon. 
 - Yes.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,500
- You look good in those clothes, Hyungnim! 
 - Thank you.

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,470
That was close...

47
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,100
It's very thankful that Mr. Woo takes care of him a lot.

48
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,840
I know.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,800
- By the way, why did he said thank you to me? 
 - What's that?

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,030
I packed some water and congee for James to have after the hospital check-up,

51
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,500
but somehow Mr. Woo was very thankful for that.

52
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,530
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,690
He must have thought of his father at home.

54
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,540
I guess so.

55
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
By the way, Hwak Se.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Isn't James and Mr. Woo kind of looks alike?

57
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,540
After hearing that, they do seem similar.

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,220
But, you and I look this similar as well! We're one family!

59
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, that's right. We're one family. That's right.

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,740
Can you tell me the patient's name one more time?

61
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,980
It's Woo Jung Hoo.

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,440
- You're his son, right? 
 - Yes.

63
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,900
We'll have to look at the test results for more details,

64
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,200
but there were no problems found during the test.

65
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,600
Is that so? That's a relief.

66
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,140
Then you must have gotten help from the police to get the check-up, right?

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,900
Ah, yes!

68
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,300
- It's great that Mr. Woo took care of the hospital and police-related works. 
 - Totally.

69
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,700
Mr. Woo! It's really great!

70
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,420
What about the food?

71
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,000
  James must be hungry.  

72
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
Ah, yes.

73
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,860
Take your time and eat slowly.

74
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,150
- Let's have this together. 
 - I already ate lunch.

75
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,690
Is that so? Then.

76
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:48,420
You did so many things because of me today. Thank you for taking off your time for me.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,880
- I heard your name is Yoo So Jang. 
 - Don't you know my name?

78
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm sorry. I think I heard it the other time.

79
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,040
It's Woo Jae Hee.

80
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,760
Ah, you have a nice name.

81
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,500
As you already know, my name is James.

82
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't remember my last name yet.

83
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,020
That's a lie, isn't it?

84
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry?

85
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,840
You can tell me the truth. You didn't lose your memory, did you?

86
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,600
- You're doing this to get rid of the trouble and go back to the past-- 
 - I know what you mean.

87
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm sorry?

88
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,280
I know that I'm a burden.

89
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,410
To the people of Samgwang villa and you, Yoo... Yoo...

90
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
  Ha, he's acting skill.  

91
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,100
It's Woo Jae Hee.

92
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,070
And to you as well, Mr. Yoo Jae Hee.

93
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,450
I know that I'm causing a lot of trouble.

94
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,540
Then, from now, I'll go my own way.

95
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,700
Oh, and the money that you spent on the hospital today, I'll make it no matter what and send it to the Samgwang villa.

96
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,760
And to the Samgwang villa people, tell that I ran away from the hospital.

97
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,510
- Thank you for everything. 
 - Wait, father-- no, I mean, wait.

98
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,930
Are you really not making this up? Are you really not acting to be like this?

99
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,400
I wish this is all act as well.

100
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,870
Thank you for everything.

101
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,750
One second. Where are you going to go?

102
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,530
Goodbye.

103
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,930
Mr. Yoo Jae Hee.

104
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,290
Yoo Jae Hee...

105
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,550
Is it real or not?

106
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:08,870
Right. He must want to go back home now. It would've been difficult for him to live with all these people in Samgwang villa.

107
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,610
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo, you can't fool me. Have a safe trip back home!

108
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,460
Bye!

109
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,400
Do you have money to go home?

110
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,040
I have some money that Soon Jung gave it to me.

111
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,260
Okay. Take a cab with that money.

112
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,600
My goodness, father. Thank goodness that I didn't tell my mom.

113
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,740
Mister!

114
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,300
- What's going on? 
 - Please, spare me! I'll pay back soon!

115
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,500
- Mister, it's not like that-- 
 - Father! Father!

116
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,920
- Father! 
 - Mr. Yoo Jae Hee!

117
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,110
Mr. Yoo Jae Hee! Mr. Yoo Jae Hee!

118
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,800
He's not well. I'm sorry.

119
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
Are you okay?

120
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,590
T-Thank you.

121
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,100
  Thank you, Mr. Yoo Jae Hee.  

122
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,010
It's not Yoo Jae Hee, it's Woo Jae Hee.

123
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,660
I said, I'm Woo Jae Hee!

124
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,200
W-Woo Jae Hee...

125
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:43,010
- Let's go. I'll go with you. 
 - No, I should go my own way...

126
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,860
Do you want to be caught by scary people again?

127
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,760
- No, I don't. 
 - Then, follow me.

128
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,370
Yes.

129
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,070
Oh, one second.

130
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:06,950
A handsome young man like you shouldn't have something like this on.

131
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,830
Those clothes, your clothes...

132
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:35,900
I look really great, don't I?

133
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,200
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes, of course!

134
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,400
But is it okay for you to spend all this money?

135
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,200
- When you regain your memory, then you can pay me back. 
 -Yes.

136
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,950
- I'll keep this price tag with me. 
 - Sure.

137
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,580
And to the people at Samgwang villa, just say that we went to the police station.

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
But we didn't go.

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,050
Your short-term memory is good.

140
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:24,530
My friend is the police, so I asked him to look for your family.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,090
Because I'm chased by debt collectors?

142
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,200
You're very considerate.

143
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,770
Yes, I'll tell to the Samgwang villa people that we went to the police station.

144
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,440
- So they don't have to worry about it. 
 - Right.

145
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,500
Your phone is ringing.

146
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,640
 Mother? 
     

147
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,990
You should answer it now! Right now.

148
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,180
Yes, mom.

149
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,690
Where are you?

150
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,880
 Ah, that feels great!  

151
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,000
That feels great!

152
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm at the bed retail store.

153
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,290
I'm trying it myself before acquiring the store.

154
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Is that so? I should've come with you.

155
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,100
Are you okay?

156
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
How is the store?

157
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,530
You're fine! You didn't get hurt. It's okay.

158
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,840
  Dad, let's play together.  

159
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,660
  Dad.  

160
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,500
  Can't you see that I'm busy? Go over there and play.  

161
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,610
  Are you okay? Thank you so much, sir.  

162
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,330
Your son is very handsome.

163
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,140
Is your father next to you?

164
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,180
No, it's not.

165
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,270
Your son is handsome as well.

166
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,400
- You guys look exactly the same. 
 - Really?

167
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,500
It is him, Mr. Woo Jung Hoo!

168
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Brother-in-law?

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,930
Noona, put me on the phone. I need to talk to him!

170
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,270
Jae Hee.

171
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,910
  I don't care if you meet your father. So you don't have to hide about it.  

172
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,290
I'm going to hang up now. Say hello to your father.

173
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,940
- Noona! You should've let me talk to him, too! 
 - You should call him for yourself!

174
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Ah, this bed feels great.

175
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,960
- How is it? 
 - Ah, yes!

176
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,550
- It makes me feel great! 
 - Right? 
 - What?

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,530
Eems hyung! You must be exhausted from taking that check-up!

178
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,580
- Jae Hee, you must be tired, too. 
 - No, it was nothing for me.

179
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,690
- Oh! Eems hyung! You look amazing! 
 - Right?

180
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:28,950
- Don't I look like James Dean? 
 - You look better than James Dean!

181
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,480
James Dean?

182
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,900
Do you remember who James Dean is?

183
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,500
Who is that?

184
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:50,500
- You know that actor back in the days, who was famous for his rebellious attitude! 
 - Is that so?

185
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,510
  His name is definitely from that actor.  

186
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,470
I should get going. I have to go back to my office. You know how to get back from here, right?

187
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,940
Of course, I know the way well. Thank you for today, Mr. Yoo Jae Hee.

188
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,430
- Ah... 
 - Mr. Woo Jae Hee.

189
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,940
Don't forget to take this with you.

190
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,980
- Have a nice day, Hyungnim. 
 - Oh, yes.

191
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,050
Have a nice day!

192
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,200
Bye! I'll see you later. Goodbye!

193
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,700
The more I see him, the more good-looking he is.

194
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,890
Well, Eems hyung.

195
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,850
Don't you think I'm like that, too?

196
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,830
The more I see, the more good-looking, that thing.

197
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,500
I mean, you are sort of handsome as well.

198
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:51,970
I think you must be, yes, you would've given out a similar feeling like Jae Hee.

199
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,820
That's so strange. Why do you guys give out similar vibes?

200
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,230
It's because both of us are good-looking.

201
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,400
Hwak Se.

202
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,290
Do you hire any more part-timers?

203
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,400
Why?

204
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,800
  Because I like you, Bit Chae Woon.  

205
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,900
Bit Chae Woon, put yourself together.

206
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,320
  For Jang Seo Ah's sake, this shouldn't happen.  

207
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,800
  Concentrate. Con-cen-trate!  

208
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,970
What are you doing?

209
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,120
There's something that I have to concentrate on.

210
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,740
Who is it? Who's distracting our Bit Chae Woon?

211
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
  Ha, Koala.  

212
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,000
Sometimes I think that you have such a special ability.

213
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,590
An ability that you can read other people's minds.

214
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,240
- No, I don't have that. 
 - But.

215
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,030
'But?'

216
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:37,800
- But, this time you're wrong! It's not because of anybody. I'm just busy with works. 
 - Then, that's a relief!

217
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,020
  Bit Chae Woon, you have a special ability as well.  

218
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,850
  An ability that makes me feel guilty time to time.  

219
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,720
Everyone, please focus for a moment.

220
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,950
- I believe every one of you heard about the round of golf event from Supervisor Yoon, right? 
 - Yes! We heard about it...

221
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,890
That's great that you're enthusiastic.

222
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:15,470
You guys also have to participate in the game, so please practice golf from today.

223
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,990
You all know there's a prize, right? I'll look forward to your performance.

224
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,880
Especially you, Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

225
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,100
Okay.

226
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,500
  It has been a while since I played golf!  

227
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,000
  Ms. Bit Chae Woon, are you good at golf?  

228
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,660
  - What about you? 
 - I'm not that good at it.  

229
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,500
Nice shot!

230
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,500
I didn't do anything...

231
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,770
Bit Chae Woon!

232
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,490
I can give you a quick golf lesson after work.

233
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,970
When I was living in the Netherlands, I played some golf.

234
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,190
Really? Then, shall we do that?

235
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,740
Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

236
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:48,150
You know that we have to work overtime from today, right? For our S/S item development.

237
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,920
Yes, I know about that. I'll work my best.

238
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,260
I guess we can't do the golf lesson.

239
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,300
     

240
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,700
Yes, CEO.

241
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,800
Oh, a round of golf event?

242
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,620
Yes. You came to our event last year.

243
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,790
It would be nice if you can participate this year as well.

244
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Okay. I'll be there. Thank you for inviting me.

245
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,400
Alright, I'll see you then.

246
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,830
Did he say he's going to come?

247
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,350
How can he say no to me?

248
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,870
Don't be like this. Stay proud of yourself.

249
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,060
Yes, mom.

250
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:48,520
I'll be more active in supporting you from now on. Have a good relationship with Jae Hee.

251
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,790
He can't help but will fall for you.

252
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,260
Mom. Thank you.

253
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,660
My goodness. Do you like him that much?

254
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,950
About the thing before...

255
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,520
I didn't hear anything!

256
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,050
You heard it.

257
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,470
I'm like James. I lost my memories.

258
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,350
I can't hear anything. I really can't hear anything!

259
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,000
Bit Chae Woon! Are you coming home now? It's late.

260
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,540
Good night, Na Ro!

261
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Headbutt! Let's talk for a second!

262
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,600
Is there something going on between you and Bit Chae Woon?

263
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,890
What is it?

264
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,970
What's going on!

265
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
Are you coming home now?

266
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,500
- Oh, I'll do that! 
 - No, it's okay.

267
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,230
  Bit Chae Woon!  

268
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,550
I'll help you next time.

269
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,860
- Wait..! 
 - Mr. Yoo Jae Hee!

270
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,640
It's not Yoo Jae Hee...

271
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,190
- Why are you still wearing this? I bought you clothes to wear. 
 - That's too good to wear.

272
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,600
I asked you, what's going on!

273
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,730
Hello, sir.

274
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,030
Let's talk in detail tomorrow.

275
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm never going to talk about it with you!

276
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,210
He doesn't have a good impression since when I first met him.

277
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,160
I know.

278
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,580
But why are you talking about that?

279
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,980
I mean, he's like, as if...

280
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,740
'As if?'

281
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,750
- He looks like a cunning penguin. 
 - CP!

282
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,300
Mr. Yoo Jae Hee, you give out a very good impression.

283
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,300
It's so strange.

284
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,570
I don't like James for no reason.

285
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
     

286
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,990
Yes, what's up?

287
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,630
Pil Hong is getting out of prison already?

288
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,300
A model prisoner?

289
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,730
He can't be getting out already.

290
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,280
This is not okay. We should start plan B.

291
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,250
  Plan B?  

292
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,890
  Did we have something like that?  

293
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,600
Did we not have it?

294
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,340
Then...

295
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,310
Hey.

296
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,670
Chul Gu in the Pil Hong's cell.

297
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
He's still there, right?

298
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,800
- Here. 
 - Thank you, sir.

299
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,040
- This is for you. 
 - Thank you, sir.

300
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,300
This is the best hotel towel with the cotton 40 thread count that I've only used 12 times.

301
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
Chul Gu, you can take this.

302
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,800
Thank you so much, hyungnim!

303
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,820
Hey! Don't cry!

304
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,900
After hearing that you're leaving the prison, I'm glad and sad at the same time, hyungnim!

305
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,090
Don't make it dirty. Use it well.

306
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,210
Hyungnim!

307
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,360
Next is my favorite items that I thought about it a lot.

308
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,300
The shampoo and conditioner.

309
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,300
- It's an all-in-one shampoo to prevent hair loss, and it smells great, too. 
   - Please give that to me, hyungnim!   

310
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
  Wait for me, world. This Park Pil Hong is coming.  

311
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,830
  I'm coming to get all the money!  

312
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,400
  Father. What happened to you?  

313
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,600
  Before we start the event, our CEO will give us a speech.  

314
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:04,600
Yes. Thank you for participating in our LX Fashion's event today.

315
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:11,610
The profits from today's event will be used for various meaningful places, such as support for orphanage.

316
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,800
Then, I hope you all enjoy today's event!

317
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,120
♫  In the extravagant building forest  ♫

318
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,120
♫  You're walking with confidence, City Boy  ♫

319
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,080
♫  In the suffocating gaze of people  ♫

320
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,210
♫  You're walking with pride, Working Girl  ♫

321
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:48,770
♫  Who would be that handsome Boy  ♫

322
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:55,980
♫  You're the star of this city, So beautiful Girl  ♫

323
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,140
Hit the ball with ease.

324
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,400
  Bit Chae Woon, she's obviously going to be a mess.  

325
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,080
  Good shot!  

326
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,010
  Do they know each other?  

327
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,310
Good shot!

328
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,600
Bit Chae Woon. When did you start playing golf?

329
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,800
Well, I don't know. Can you guess it?

330
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:57,150
Wow, you acted like you can't play at all. I was worried about you for nothing.

331
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,580
I wasn't that worrisome.

332
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,790
CP, he's so excited.

333
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,500
- What's CP? 
 - Oh, it's nothing.

334
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,900
- Oppa, do you know Bit Chae Woon? 
 - What?

335
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,400
You look like you know each other.

336
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,210
She helped my work at our construction site...

337
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,380
Ah, she did interior work before. That's how you know each other.

338
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:31,100
And also, in fact, she's the daughter of the owner of the place where I'm living right now.

339
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,210
Really?

340
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,240
But then, why didn't you say anything about her at the barbecue place last time?

341
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,660
I was a bit out of my mind that day.

342
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,900
What are you guys doing? Go on a date after the game.

343
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,200
- CP! Are you going to be okay with those terrible shots? 
 - You should be worried about yourself, Koala.

344
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,300
- Where did your golf balls go? 
 - What about it?

345
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,540
  - It went to the right side. 
 - It's a waste of time to talk with you.  

346
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,470
Jae Hee. Thank you for coming today.

347
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,520
Today's weather was perfect! Thank you for inviting me.

348
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:22,280
You know what I'm going to say, right?

349
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,160
My Seo Ah, I love her the most in this whole world.

350
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,860
I can't see my daughter being heartbroken.

351
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:43,300
Jae Hee, if you are not seeing anyone these days, can you try harder?

352
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:49,940
I want you to think about Seo Ah a little more.

353
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,550
  You guys were here!  

354
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,980
What were you talking about?

355
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,600
It was a story about making myself look bad.

356
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,400
Mom.

357
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,820
- Jae Hee's form is really good! 
 - Right! 
   - No, I'm not good.  

358
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,910
- I was hitting draw a lot today. 
   - Is that so?  

359
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,950
- Seo Ah was great today! 
   - No, I just have good posture. Mom is a real good player.  

360
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:37,280
You said it doesn't matter, Bit Chae Woon!

361
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:43,600
After talking big to Koala, why am I feeling bad like this?

362
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,130
  Good shot!  

363
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,470
- Oh, CEO. 
 - Ms. Bit Chae Woon, I thought you were only good at golf, but you're good at soccer as well!

364
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,250
You're so pretty.

365
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,590
Thank you.

366
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,010
Why are you walking back home?

367
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,010
- Why are you walking? 
 - (Both) I wanted to enjoy the weather--

368
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,420
Jinx!

369
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:23,230
When did you learn golf? Soon Jung said that you were busy supporting your family.

370
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,070
It wasn't that bad.

371
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:31,550
I used to work at a screen golf studio for a long time. The professional golfer taught me how to play from time to time.

372
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,910
And for a year, I worked as a caddy every weekend.

373
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,440
You worked really hard, Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

374
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,780
- Let's get in the car now. 
 - I'm going to walk and take the bus over there.

375
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,790
Do you think I'm going to let you go like this? I'll drive you home.

376
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,190
Seo Ah.

377
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,500
If you're going to say we should be just friends, then I'm not going to listen.

378
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,100
No, you should listen to me.

379
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,380
There's someone that I like. I thought it would be better to tell you precisely even though it's tough to hear.

380
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
Who is that?

381
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,690
Who is it?

382
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,500
We are not in a relationship, so I don't feel okay to talk about her name.

383
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:31,300
You're not even in a relationship yet. Of course, you can like somebody. Like the way I like you.

384
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,210
But I'm not going to give you up.

385
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,900
You're spending time with me because my mom forced you, right? Thank you.

386
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
- There's a cafe that I know. Why don't we go there? 
 - Seo Ah.

387
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,500
I think it would be great if we can stop this here.

388
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,970
I'll consider stoping it when you actually start dating the woman.

389
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Until then, there's still a chance for me.

390
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:09,490
I'm not going to give you up. Let's go.

391
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,210
Seo Ah, Seo--

392
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,530
You can just drop me off at a subway station.

393
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,030
How can I do that? I'll drive you to your place.

394
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,650
- Please do that, driver. 
   - Yes, CEO.  

395
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,640
- Then, can I make a phone call? 
 - Go ahead.

396
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,800
To our neighborhood?

397
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,840
Yes. She insists on driving me home.

398
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,780
She's driving me all the way there, so maybe we should have some tea time together?

399
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,760
  I'm fine.  

400
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,700
Don't feel pressured, Soon Jung! I'm going to drop her off and leave right away.

401
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,030
What should I do, mom?

402
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,310
Chae Woon.

403
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,980
  Yes.  

404
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,975
Bring your CEO with you.

405
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:19,634
Is that okay? Alright, mom!

406
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:23,474
- Did she say it's okay for me to visit? 
 - Yes.

407
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:25,814
  That's great.  

408
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:51,314
I did clean the house already...

409
00:35:51,964 --> 00:35:54,734
What should I do more?

410
00:35:57,344 --> 00:36:00,874
Is there something going on?

411
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:06,214
Oh, yes, a guest is coming over. Important guest is coming...

412
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:09,774
Is that so..?

413
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:17,014
Are you okay? Your face got pale.

414
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:25,264
It's a very difficult guest, so I don't know what to do...

415
00:36:25,274 --> 00:36:31,524
A difficult guest... Is it a debt collector?

416
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:36,514
Maybe it's like that.

417
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:49,014
My goodness, Kim Hwak Se. We always run into each other.

418
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:03,294
Oh, I'm seeing stuff now. I guess I'm losing my mind.

419
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:07,964
Did he start working already?

420
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:10,504
Are you here?

421
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:17,414
- Auntie! 
 - You surprised me!

422
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:21,904
- Why are you going this way? That way is closer to home. 
 - I just want to have some walk.

423
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:25,194
- Are you trying to do some workout?  
 - Yes, I need some workout.

424
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:30,064
Wow, look at that car!

425
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,794
Yeah, looks great!

426
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,724
Is that Bit Chae?

427
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:47,334
Huh? That lady is!

428
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,104
  Your younger sister?  

429
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:53,814
Let's go. Let's go.

430
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,814
- This is where I live. 
 - Oh, right here?

431
00:37:56,914 --> 00:38:00,514
Hello, CEO. We met each other before at your place.

432
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,764
- I'm Chae Woon's younger sister. 
 - Ah, that's right!

433
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:08,044
- It's good to see you again. 
 - Me, too! I really wanted to see you again.

434
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:10,454
Is that so?

435
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:13,424
Jung Won unni?

436
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:17,414
She's our aunt.

437
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:21,814
Unni, I'm Man Jung. Soon Jung's second younger sister.

438
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:26,054
- The one who was in middle school back then? You visited us in every school vacation! 
 - Yes!

439
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:31,684
- Soon Jung was bragging about you that you are always the top of the school. 
 - My goodness, unni!

440
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:37,814
I heard that you are the CEO of where Bit Chae's working, but it's so crazy that we see each other like this!

441
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:40,214
It's really great to see you again!

442
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:43,304
Unni, I'm so happy to see you!

443
00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:46,054
My goodness, unni!

444
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:53,554
  - Unni, you're still beautiful! It's crazy! 
 - Thank you!  

445
00:38:53,884 --> 00:38:55,864
  My goodness!  

446
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:05,694
  Relax, Lee Soon Jung. Calm down.  

447
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:10,114
I think the guest is here!

448
00:39:10,134 --> 00:39:11,954
Is that so?

449
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:19,314
Are you okay?!

450
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:29,274
I'm sorry. I should've not made a fuss.

451
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,464
  Mom!  

452
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:33,014
Yes!

453
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:38,214
- T-Then, I'll be upstairs. 
 - Yes.

454
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,594
Young lady Jung Won!

455
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:58,794
- I'm sorry that we came all of a sudden, Soon Jung. 
 - It's okay.

456
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:01,414
You didn't have to bring anything. Thank you.

457
00:40:01,444 --> 00:40:04,004
- Unni, we are home, too! 
 - Mom!

458
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:09,094
- That middle school girl grew up this much? 
 - Unni! It's more like I got old this much.

459
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:11,814
You are not old!

460
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:14,354
Mom, what happened to your hand?

461
00:40:14,384 --> 00:40:17,254
  - Did you cut yourself? 
 - No, it's nothing.  

462
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:23,084
Aigo, our unni got nervous because a precious guest is coming.

463
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:27,724
Did you get hurt a lot? I should've not come if I was going to surprise you.

464
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:30,354
No, it's okay. I didn't hurt that much.

465
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,954
Unni, let's go inside and disinfect the wound. Hae Deun, you should carry this inside.

466
00:40:36,794 --> 00:40:41,094
- Please, come inside. 
 - Yes, come inside. Please, come this way.

467
00:40:58,484 --> 00:41:02,284
This is very pretty! Did you prepare this, Ms. Bit Chae Woon?

468
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:05,694
- Ah, that's... 
 - Mom prepared this already.

469
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,614
Unni can't prepare fruits like this at all.

470
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:13,114
I can't do it like this as well.

471
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:16,914
Young lady, you like rice with radish, right? I'll make it for you.

472
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:22,214
No, do it next time, Soon Jung! It's early for dinner as well.

473
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:28,784
The house is cozy and nice. I can feel your touch, Soon Jung.

474
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,884
Oh, that is...

475
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:37,124
Do you mean this?

476
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:40,674
This is mom, dad, unni, me, and our younger brother.

477
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:43,414
  Is that so?  

478
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:48,014
Ms. Bit Chae Woon, you were pretty when you were young as well!

479
00:41:48,124 --> 00:41:50,104
  Maybe you take after your father?  

480
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:53,804
I took after our father, and people said unni took after our mother.

481
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:58,504
Is that so? My daughter looks like me as well.

482
00:41:58,524 --> 00:42:04,624
Bit Chae. You and the CEO look very similar right now.

483
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:08,514
- Am I right, unni? 
 - Is that so?

484
00:42:09,714 --> 00:42:15,414
Maybe it's because we like each other. People say that you resemble each other when you like someone.

485
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:18,214
I guess so.

486
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,304
Then I'm going to like you as well! I want to be like you, too, CEO.

487
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:24,814
Hae Deun.

488
00:42:24,844 --> 00:42:28,074
Thank you, Hae Deun.

489
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:34,044
- Ms. Bit Chae Woon! Where's your room? 
 - Ah, it's over there.

490
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:36,214
Can I see your room?

491
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:39,514
Ah, it's messy in there...

492
00:42:51,964 --> 00:42:53,304
Unni.

493
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:57,164
That unni is still very bright and innocent, isn't she?

494
00:42:57,164 --> 00:43:01,834
I think people with money are bright. Don't you agree?

495
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:06,414
By the way, why are you sweating so much? What's wrong?

496
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:10,214
No, it's nothing.

497
00:43:12,944 --> 00:43:15,934
I guess my unni is nervous.

498
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:39,124
- Ms. Bit Chae Woon, are you studying English these days? 
 - Just a little bit when I have time.

499
00:43:39,214 --> 00:43:44,814
Wow, it's a difficult book. I guess you're good at English!

500
00:43:44,814 --> 00:43:48,204
Well, you should study hard to go to America for training.

501
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:52,724
- Is she going to America? 
 - It's not determined yet. I have to work hard for it.

502
00:43:52,754 --> 00:43:57,074
You have been working hard!

503
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:08,754
Ms. Bit Chae Woon, your style of work like this is very similar to mine.

504
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:15,954
- You've seen my studies before, right? 
 - Yes. It looked similar to me as well.

505
00:44:37,924 --> 00:44:41,214
  - CEO! Do you want to see the second floor as well? 
 - Shall we?  

506
00:44:41,214 --> 00:44:43,784
  Come this way!  

507
00:44:58,314 --> 00:45:01,914
  The second floor is great, too! It's very sunny.  

508
00:45:02,014 --> 00:45:04,714
  How many rooms do you have?  

509
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:07,694
There's a lot of rooms! Is it all rented out?

510
00:45:07,744 --> 00:45:11,144
Yes, somehow it became like that.

511
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:14,004
One of them is my room. I live here as well.

512
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:16,204
Is that so?

513
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:20,574
- I lost everything and came to my older sister. 
 - Man Jung...

514
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:23,214
  What's wrong with that?  

515
00:45:25,794 --> 00:45:32,224
Ah, CEO. Mr. Woo Jae Hee, he lives here as well. In the room over there.

516
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:34,334
Really?

517
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:41,584
- Do you know Mr. Woo? 
 - Yes, he's my daughter's boyfriend.

518
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:44,014
Oh, my god!

519
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:49,414
Wow, that's a twist! Did you know about this, unni?

520
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:54,094
  Jae Hee. How can he didn't tell Seo Ah that he lives here?  

521
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:57,014
I thought Mr. Woo looked like he has something!

522
00:45:57,034 --> 00:46:03,554
It was very recent for me as well to know that you knew each other. Because Mr. Woo came to our company's get-together dinner.

523
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:10,724
Ah, is that so. I guess Seo Ah will visit here soon too, then.

524
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:15,434
- I'm home! 
 - Welcome!

525
00:46:16,304 --> 00:46:20,344
Oh, this is our youngest.

526
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:24,614
- She's the CEO of your oldest sister's company. Say hello. 
 - Nice to meet you! I'm Lee Ra Hoon.

527
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:28,114
  Wow, your son is very handsome!  

528
00:46:33,814 --> 00:46:37,134
Ra Hoon goes to Seohan university for a business major.

529
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:40,214
- He goes to the same school where I graduated. 
   - Oh, really?  

530
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:44,014
I guess you're smart as much as your older sister!

531
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:46,764
No, I'm not that smart.

532
00:46:48,714 --> 00:46:54,314
By the way, Soon Jung. Do you make bean paste at home, too?

533
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:59,084
- I'm smelling some fermented soybean. 
 - No, it's not like that.

534
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:02,114
I-I'm sorry. I'll be back from the shower.

535
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:08,414
- It's his smelly feet. 
 - Oh! Oh, no. It was fine!

536
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:13,614
  - You never smelled something like this before, did you?   
 - I guess you're right.

537
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:17,014
You don't have to come out for me! Go back inside.

538
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:22,014
I'm sorry that I couldn't make you have dinner. Please let me make dinner for you next time.

539
00:47:22,044 --> 00:47:26,244
Don't worry about that. I'll visit you often from now on.

540
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:28,934
You should come to our place. I'll invite you all.

541
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:33,684
- Really? I really wanted to go to your place again! 
   - Stop that, Lee Hae Deun!  

542
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:36,904
- I guess I should invite Hae Deun first! 
 - Unni! I'll come to see you as well.

543
00:47:36,944 --> 00:47:39,184
- Of course! 
 - Noonim!

544
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:44,804
Noonim! Hello! Do you remember me? I met you at the Yeonhui-dong house last time.

545
00:47:44,854 --> 00:47:47,414
Of course, I remember you! It's good to see you again.

546
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:50,674
You should've told me if this noonim was visiting today!

547
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:54,824
Uncle! You shouldn't call her noonim but the CEO.

548
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:57,214
She's the CEO of where Bit Chae works.

549
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:59,574
Noonim is great!

550
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:04,664
If I'm Soon Jung noonim's friend, then I'm a noonim as well. Right, Soon Jung?

551
00:48:04,704 --> 00:48:08,834
But still, you should call her the CEO.

552
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:12,034
Let's see each other again, young brother.

553
00:48:12,114 --> 00:48:15,414
I'll see you, Soon Jung. I'll see you at the office, Bit Chae Woon.

554
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:19,514
- Bye! 
 - Have a safe trip back home!

555
00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:23,884
Unni, it was great seeing you again!

556
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:36,154
Bit Chae Woon is very pretty.

557
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:54,104
Mom.

558
00:48:54,804 --> 00:48:59,424
I think the CEO looked sad somehow.

559
00:49:02,664 --> 00:49:06,234
Was there something going on today?

560
00:49:06,254 --> 00:49:12,974
No, nothing happened. But I felt like that when she was looking around in my room.

561
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:17,364
Probably I saw it wrong.

562
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:24,344
Mom. I made you surprised because I brought her all of a sudden, right?

563
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:30,914
You seemed nervous. Is it because she's the CEO of my workplace?

564
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:35,724
Don't be nervous! You saw how much she liked me.

565
00:49:37,614 --> 00:49:42,414
You're right. Let's go inside.

566
00:49:50,414 --> 00:49:52,014
Yes, let's go inside.

567
00:50:46,814 --> 00:50:50,014
- Are you preparing for dinner? 
 - Yes, mom. It's okay to prepare with what we have here, right?

568
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:54,104
Yes. Oh, are you helping as well, James?

569
00:50:54,124 --> 00:50:57,744
You did so much work for the guest, didn't you?

570
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:06,814
- Mom, are you going somewhere? 
 - Oh, yes. I have to go help at the house at Yeonhui-dong.

571
00:51:06,824 --> 00:51:11,944
I'll be back from work. I'll have my dinner at the place.

572
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:15,054
James, thank you for helping.

573
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:17,724
- I'll be back. 
 - I'll see you later, mom.

574
00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:21,134
- See you later, mom. 
 - See you later.

575
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,314
Why did she call our mom in for work all of a sudden?

576
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:31,344
This is the hard part of our mom's job.

577
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:18,914
I can't do this anymore. Not anymore.

578
00:52:33,294 --> 00:52:35,394
The CEO visited the Samgwang villa?

579
00:52:35,424 --> 00:52:41,004
Yes! Jung Won noonim and Soon Jung noonim knew each other from the old times.

580
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:43,194
I think that's why she visited today.

581
00:52:43,704 --> 00:52:45,474
Oh, that's right.

582
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:51,084
I heard that you're dating Jung Won noonim's daughter.

583
00:52:51,104 --> 00:52:54,234
- That's what the CEO said? 
 - That's what I heard from other people.

584
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:57,914
- Did Bit Chae Woon hear that, too? 
 - I think she heard as well.

585
00:52:57,944 --> 00:53:01,334
Everyone in Samgwang villa knows about that now.

586
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:07,754
Jae Hee, I didn't know you were such an ambitious person. You'll be the son-in-law of that big company soon.

587
00:53:07,754 --> 00:53:12,614
I'm not going to be a son-in-law! Good luck with your work!

588
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:17,454
What the hell was that?

589
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:21,164
Is he already boasting in front of me?

590
00:53:22,184 --> 00:53:26,134
Well, but still, I should try to be nice to him for my future.

591
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:42,214
  Bit Chae Woon, let's meet right now for a second. Come out to the gate.   

592
00:53:57,604 --> 00:53:59,664
  Bit Chae Woon?  

593
00:54:39,054 --> 00:54:42,374
I send you a text. Did you see it..?

594
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:45,564
I was in the shower.

595
00:54:46,944 --> 00:54:51,024
- I-- 
   - Unni! Are you done with the bathroom?  

596
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:52,894
Yes!

597
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:57,124
- Can you come out for a second? 
 - What are you doing?

598
00:54:57,154 --> 00:55:00,134
I have something to tell you. Just for a second.

599
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:14,554
♫  The wind was breezy,   ♫

600
00:55:14,574 --> 00:55:21,104
- ♫  so I went out to the garden   ♫ 
   - Stop that, auntie!  

601
00:55:21,114 --> 00:55:23,534
Why is he screaming!

602
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:29,524
♫  The wind was breezy,   ♫

603
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:31,114
- Come out with me. 
 - Mr. Koala!

604
00:55:31,214 --> 00:55:33,214
Come out with me for a second.

605
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:39,914
What are you doing right now!

606
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:41,984
Ah, I'm sorry.

607
00:55:42,314 --> 00:55:44,614
You must be cold.

608
00:55:52,354 --> 00:55:55,424
It's better now, right?

609
00:55:56,694 --> 00:56:00,054
- I'm hot now. 
 - Don't take it off.

610
00:56:00,614 --> 00:56:03,894
Your hair is wet, so you should keep your body warm.

611
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:13,114
The reason why I wanted to talk to you is...

612
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:17,514
The CEO came by our place today.

613
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:21,694
- Yes, I heard about that. 
 - I told her that you live here.

614
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:23,774
Since she'll know about that eventually.

615
00:56:24,084 --> 00:56:27,144
- You did the right thing. 
 - Next time...

616
00:56:27,794 --> 00:56:30,234
She'll come with Seo Ah.

617
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:33,834
- You're Seo Ah's boyfriend, so-- 
 - Today,

618
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:37,434
I told exactly how I feel to Seo Ah.

619
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:42,354
- About what? 
 - That I have...

620
00:56:42,954 --> 00:56:45,524
somebody that I like.

621
00:56:47,744 --> 00:56:50,394
It wouldn't be easy.

622
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:55,144
But if we settle things out step by step...

623
00:56:56,034 --> 00:56:58,344
Step by step and then?

624
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:01,864
And then...

625
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:11,614
- After that, let's officially-- 
 - I really like our CEO. I respect her a lot.

626
00:57:11,734 --> 00:57:20,844
It seemed to be the CEO likes you very much as well. Of course, you're the guy her daughter likes.

627
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:25,140
Honestly, more than Seo Ah,

628
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,280
I don't want to disappoint the CEO.

629
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,100
Wait.

630
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:40,190
Aside from all that, what about you, Chae Woon? Even though you respect her, isn't your feeling the most important thing?

631
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:45,320
- I think you have the same feeling-- 
 - My feeling is...

632
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,360
My feeling is...

633
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,930
We are...

634
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:59,950
We are forever headbutt and koala!

635
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,700
- It's getting cold now. 
 - Bit Chae Woon.

636
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:08,200
Let's stop talking about this anymore.

637
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,150
  If mom figures this out, then she'll say I should give up on him.  

638
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,680
  She'll say that I don't have any self-respect.  

639
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:45,230
  I shouldn't tell mom about this. I'll figure it out by myself.  

640
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,700
  Yes?  

641
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,430
- Mom! 
 - Yes!

642
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:07,090
You're in a good mood after going to Bit Chae Woon's place.

643
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:14,000
It was so much fun. I don't remember when I laughed that much before. Let's go together next time.

644
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,480
Sure.

645
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:24,490
It's so strange! Bit Chae Woon's work style is very similar to mine.

646
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:32,860
If I hear her story, she had a hard upbringing, but I don't know how she grew up as such a bright person.

647
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:37,810
I guess you wish Bit Chae Woon was your daughter.

648
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,660
What?

649
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:47,410
Honestly, I don't like that you like Bit Chae Woon. I hate that.

650
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:55,600
- Seo Ah. 
 - I didn't like her for no reason since I was young.

651
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:01,440
That's why I did that bad thing when we were in middle school.

652
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:09,000
Ever since she joined our company, you liked her a lot and praised her and says that she has a lot in common with you.

653
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,510
Whenever I hear something like that it makes me...

654
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

655
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:22,000
I didn't know my daughter was feeling like that. I'm sorry.

656
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:27,780
I know that I'm being childish. I know that.

657
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:34,270
But I was in a bad mood today with something else.

658
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:45,380
- But then, even my mom was... 
 - I always have a lot of compassion...

659
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:52,410
for girls the age of you or Bit Chae Woon.

660
01:00:53,190 --> 01:01:01,170
I think that's why I felt more attachment to Bit Chae Woon, who had a hard upbringing.

661
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,430
Why?

662
01:01:55,300 --> 01:02:00,890
  - Do you know Mr. Woo? 
 - Yes, he's my daughter's boyfriend.  

663
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,420
It would've been nice if I were Jang Seo Ah.

664
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:13,480
Why am I thinking something like this?

665
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,200
Mom! When did you come home?

666
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:24,310
Just now.

667
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,600
- Were you studying? 
 - Yes.

668
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,170
That lady of Yeonhui-dong gives you hard time.

669
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,500
Your hands are frozen!

670
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,470
It got warmer now, right?

671
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,700
Where's Hae Deun?

672
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:50,010
Ah, she's in the auntie's room. They're going to watch a movie.

673
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,100
Chae Woon.

674
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,840
Yes?

675
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,210
Do you...

676
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,830
Do you...

677
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:33,890
Do you want to meet your biological mother?

678
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,900
You're talking about that again.

679
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,900
I really don't care about my biological parents anymore.

680
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,590
I...

681
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,200
I found her.

682
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,300
Your biological mother.

683
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:10,700
A long time ago, even long before when I met you and Joon Ah's father.

684
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,270
- You know that I was married before, right? 
 - Yes.

685
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,460
At that time,

686
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,600
I had a daughter.

687
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:33,090
She has the same age as you, Seo Ah.

688
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:42,100
But I lost her.

689
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:00,120
This is her in the photo.

690
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,150
My daughter.

691
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,400
Let's...

692
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,530
Let's meet her.

693
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,570
Your biological mother, Chae Woon.

694
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:36,810
Where is she?

695
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,230
She's very close around us.

696
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:53,000
Close around us?

697
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,240
It's Ms. Kim Jung Won.

698
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,500
Do you mean the CEO?

699
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,700
Mom.

700
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,300
     

701
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,100
  So, CEO Kim Jung Won have a lost daughter?  

702
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,200
  We look alike..!  

703
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,340
  - Hae Deun! 
 - Mom!  

704
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,100
  - Somehow I was drawn to you from the beginning. 
 - Me, too.  

705
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,710
  This house is really nice.  

706
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,700
  Cha Ba Reun. Wait, you're Kim Joon Woo?  

707
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,700
  Go and pack your stuff up now!  

708
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,100
  Mom, I'm sorry that I lied to you that I go to Seohan university.  

709
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,550
  You have bad blood pressure. 

710
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,490
  I feel like somebody told me this before.  

711
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,640
  That's a great sign! You're recovering your memory.  

712
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,000
  Mom, you're being very selfish.  

713
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,200
  I'm going to get some benefit from you. I'm going to live comfortably from now on by using you!  

714
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,800
  Mom!  

715
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,300
  If you meet the CEO without my permission. You won't be able to get any benefit from me. 

716
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,600
  Koala, can you come here for a second?  

717
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,490
  Where are you?
