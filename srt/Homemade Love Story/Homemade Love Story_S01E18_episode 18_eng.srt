♫  We will make a beautiful love  ♫

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,410
Oh? Mr. Yoo Jae Hee!

6
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,700
- Do you think James might have seen it? 
 - I don't know.

7
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,070
- Oh, no!  I don't know! 
 - Let me go with you!

8
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,140
Ms. Lee's daughter! Mr. Yoo Jae Hee!

9
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,950
I'm not a debt collector, why are they running away from me?

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,460
Ah, I guess they want to be with just each other.

11
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,110
     

12
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,430
Is he still following us?

13
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,870
He seems to be on the way for delivery, so I don't think he'll follow us.

14
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,200
I might miss my train. I'll get going.

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,570
Why didn't you change a bit?

16
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,680
I expressed as much as I can for you to not go.

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,640
I promised to take an interview with Mr. Park today.

18
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,440
What interview? I already checked with him. It's not decided yet.

19
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,570
I know that Mr. Park is going back and forth with another person.

20
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,800
I know about that, too! That's why I was going to make a deal with him today.

21
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,590
Don't go.

22
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,570
- Please don't go! 
 - I don't like something like this!

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,340
I don't like to not do what I was going to do just because I got a boyfriend now.

24
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,870
Boyfriend?

25
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,770
Did you just call me your boyfriend? Did I become your boyfriend now?

26
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,970
Okay!

27
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,170
And I know it's not about the work! You just want to get away from here.

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,010
There are tons of work you can do here as well! My site needs tons of help!

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,230
Wait for a second, this Mr. Park guy...

30
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,370
I'll call him. I should do it.

31
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,770
    
   

32
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,170
He just called me.

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,450
Ah, yes, Mr. Park. I was about to call you.

34
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,840
You already found someone?

35
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,770
Okay!

36
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,580
Well, what can I do? It's okay.

37
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,530
I'm at Seoul station right now.

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,050
Yes, I should just go back home.

39
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,170
- Ah, yes. If you need my help next time, call me again. Bye! 
 - The next station is the Seoul station, Seoul station.

40
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,170
- I knew it was going to work out. 
 - What should I do now?

41
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,570
Well, what can I do?

42
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:21,260
You must be embarrassed right now since you made this big fuss.

43
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,330
I think you did great! Ever since I met you, headbutt, I like what you did today the most.

44
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,070
By the way, now I look at you, you look like our Moong-i.

45
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,870
- Moong-i? 
 - The puppy that I had when I was young. 
      

46
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,030
She was really cute.

47
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:53,570
Alright! Since I got upgraded as your boyfriend today, I'm going to upgrade your nickname from headbutt to Moong-i.

48
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,770
What is that? You were calling me a headbutt and now it's Moong-i?

49
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,670
- You look like a puppy with your eyes like this. 
 - Stop that!

50
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,560
- Say Mung-Moong, Mung-Moong. It's going to be so cute! 
 - Stop it! No!

51
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,100
- Hyungnim... 
 - I came here to grab a sweater since it got so cold today.

52
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,390
I didn't see anything, promise.

53
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,490
My goodness...

54
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,380
That's exciting.

55
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,830
Bit Chae Woon...

56
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,710
Did you tell her about the result as well?

57
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,320
I haven't told her yet.

58
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,580
She was very against taking the DNA test.

59
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,550
So, Man Jung did this in the secret of Chae Woon.

60
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,670
  I didn't do anything wrong.  

61
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,720
  You're such a bad person. You don't know how to regret it, and you don't even have a conscience.  

62
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,850
  It's really true.  

63
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,130
  I didn't hit Seo Ah back then.  

64
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,560
  If we said we'd forgive you, you should just let it go. But why are you trying to dig it up? 

65
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,210
  - I'll be out for a minute. 
 - I'll come with you.  

66
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,720
  No, I'm fine.  

67
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,630
What should I do...

68
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,670
I did a terrible thing to my daughter, Seo Yeon.

69
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,290
What are you doing, Soon Jung.

70
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,780
Don't do that. Stand up, now!

71
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,420
You can think in any way

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,660
about how I raised Chae Woon.

73
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:39,330
And you can judge me in any way about why I can't tell you anymore in detail about this.

74
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,640
I'll take any punishment you will give it to me.

75
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,070
- CEO! 
    - Director Jang!  

76
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,290
  Come back later.  

77
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,790
- Mom? 
    - I said, come back later!  

78
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,310
I know you can't forgive me,

79
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:33,360
but I just want you to know that I raised my Chae Woon with my best.

80
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,690
I'll call her now.

81
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,980
Yes, let's forget about everything and start fresh.

82
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,000
Where should I start?

83
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,950
Let's do a deep-cleaning.

84
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,140
  Big sister! Just calling you for no reason.  

85
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,500
  You know that I love you so much, right?  

86
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,560
     

87
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,180
  My big baby brother! I love you, too.  

88
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,770
  Unni! I just called you for no reason. You can do it!  

89
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:10,670
  I hope your work as a trainee is going well. Call me whenever you need me! You can do it, too!  

90
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,220
  Hae Deun, I think you should give up now.  

91
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,560
  I asked around some places, but I think you should give up on your dream of becoming an idol.  

92
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,980
Ha... What should I do now?

93
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:34,740
I have only raised a vain dream, and I have done nothing, and have no purpose anymore.

94
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,320
So, you're dropping out of the class as well?

95
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,940
Why are you--

96
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,340
  I mean, I'll be more patient with you from now on!  

97
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,570
Can you please not drop out of the class?

98
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,980
You probably thought I'll say it like that, right?

99
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,950
You made a great choice.

100
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,570
You were barely doing your homework and didn't come to the class that often. Even I thought you were wasting your money.

101
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,570
It's a great choice that you're dropping out now.

102
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,090
You can talk to our office about the refund. I'll get going, bye.

103
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,970
I'm in big trouble now... Excuse me!

104
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,950
You have a lot of time, don't you?

105
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,650
Are you talking to me?

106
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,770
- Yes. You look like you have a lot of time. Let me ask you a favor. 
 - I-I'm busy!

107
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,570
Excuse me! One second, please.

108
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,670
Can I ask you a favor? Please!

109
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,870
  Bell pepper and onion. Meatball.  

110
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,810
If you sit down for 50 minutes, I'll pay you 50,000 won.

111
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,230
Please?

112
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,230
- 50,000 won? 
 - 50,000 won.

113
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,470
- Can I just be here like this? 
 - What's that?

114
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:21,160
You should look at the textbook and talk with me. He's here, he's here. Let's start.

115
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,970
What's your dream?

116
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,770
- I'm sorry? 
 - My goodness... He only has one student!

117
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,070
What? Dream, dream. I'm asking what you want to do in the future.

118
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,960
My dream?

119
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,000
There must be a goal in your life, right? If you're a person, you must have one.

120
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,730
Let's try this again. What is your dream?

121
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,180
My dream...

122
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,810
I don't have a dream.

123
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,590
It disappeared...

124
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,770
Why are you crying all of a sudden? What's going on?

125
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,160
  Are you crying because you can't speak English?  

126
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,640
He left. The director left...

127
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,490
I really have to impress the director. All of my students ran away. Please stop crying!

128
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,170
Let's cry together.

129
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,660
My god, for real...

130
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,670
Why did every student of mine run away? What did I do wrong?

131
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,420
  Welcome!  

132
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,570
     

133
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,970
I know you said you don't want to take the DNA test, but--

134
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,370
I said we should do it.

135
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,270
Can you trust it now?

136
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,450
Why are you showing this to me, mom?

137
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,550
Now the result came out perfectly, I should move to her place?

138
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,250
  Chae Woon...  

139
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,590
Seo Yeon.

140
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,630
- I-- 
 - My name is

141
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,670
Bit Chae Woon.

142
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,190
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

143
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:48,540
Like I told you before, I still feel the same way.

144
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,750
This doesn't mean anything to me.

145
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:01,960
I only have one real mother in this world.

146
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,840
And that's Lee Soon Jung.

147
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,670
Let's go, mom.

148
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,790
Chae Woon, why are you being like this?

149
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,710
Soon Jung.

150
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,700
I want to talk with Bit Chae Woon, just two of us.

151
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,260
Yes, sure.

152
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,570
Mom.

153
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,170
Then, I'll get going now.

154
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,420
Mom--

155
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,910
I want to apologize to you.

156
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,740
About everything in the past.

157
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:53,670
I want to ask you for forgiveness.

158
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,270
There's nothing for me to forgive you.

159
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,300
I...

160
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:16,070
I... want to be your mother.

161
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,480
I want to be your mother.

162
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,710
Please let me be your mother.

163
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,960
You don't have to move into my place.

164
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,310
Seo Yeon...

165
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,420
I don't want to be your daughter, CEO.

166
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:59,560
So, please don't bother my mom and me from now on.

167
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,270
Please.

168
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,400
Seo Yeon..!

169
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,440
You did the DNA test with my mom, didn't you?

170
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,260
I think so.

171
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,170
Then?

172
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,440
Are you my mom's daughter?

173
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,490
How can you be?

174
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,400
How can a person like you is my mom's daughter?

175
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,940
How can you be! How can a person like you can be!

176
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,770
Seo Ah.

177
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm exhausted right now.

178
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,870
Let's talk about this later.

179
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,490
Bit Chae Woon! Are you going to move into our house?

180
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,160
Are you going to move into our house and live as my mom's daughter!

181
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,960
Why can't I do that?

182
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,970
It's my mother's house after all!

183
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:45,670
If you move into our house, do you think I'll let that just happen?

184
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,970
Do you think I'll lose my mom to a person like you?

185
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,080
'A person like you?'

186
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,500
I also don't want anything from a person like you.

187
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,240
You can have it all.

188
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,710
Bit Chae Woon! Hey!!

189
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,710
Why are you telling me this now?

190
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,440
Why didn't you tell me that your brother-in-law wasn't coming into the office until now!

191
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,710
Jae Hee said it'll make you worry.

192
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,330
Also, you're going to the hospital these days.

193
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,630
Even so, you should've told me about this!

194
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,270
What's wrong with him? Is he..?

195
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,180
No, no! I don't think it's anything serious!

196
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,890
But I think he was also having a hard time after getting a divorce with you.

197
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,420
Jae Hee, this punk.

198
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,000
He's not picking up his phone.

199
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,970
- An emergency board meeting? 
 - Yes.

200
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,090
We have an urgent matter to discuss with the development of our new product.

201
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,950
President has to be there this time.

202
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
I'm sorry.

203
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,170
     

204
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,470
Is that so?

205
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,990
  I'm sorry.  

206
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,070
     

207
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,170
  I'm sorry, mom. I'm at the construction site right now, so I'll call you later at night.  

208
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,480
    
  I'm busy right now. I'll talk to you later.  

209
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,550
ls that so?

210
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,650
Then, we have no choice but to dispatch this agent Jung Min Jae.

211
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:22,490
Chae Woon likes beef-radish soup and braised short rib.

212
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,170
Thank you, bye!

213
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,700
Can I have those vegetables?

214
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,090
This one and also those carrots, please.

215
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,770
Ms. Lee!

216
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,570
- James! Are you coming back from delivery? 
 - Yes.

217
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,730
- Let me hold that for you. 
 - No, you don't have to!

218
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,470
- Please, let me hold it for you. 
 - Thank you.

219
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,300
Oh, it's egg buns.

220
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,870
Do you want one?

221
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,400
Two buns, please.

222
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,110
Here it is. Thank you.

223
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,870
- Please, have some. 
 - Thank you.

224
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,570
- You're going to burn yourself! Eat it slowly. Really slowly. 
 - Yes.

225
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,810
It's really good!

226
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,250
  - It's good, right?   
 - Yes.

227
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,110
Someone used to be good at making egg buns.

228
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,930
Who was that?

229
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,810
I-I don't know.

230
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,270
I can't remember it.

231
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,830
  Soon Jung!  

232
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,110
  I brought you something...  

233
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,060
  - Egg buns? 
 - Ah, it's because...  

234
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,590
   You gave me the dictionary before.  

235
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,020
  I wanted to express my gratitude.  

236
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,990
  Wait, Soon Jung!  

237
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,260
I'm just wondering, I asked you about this before as well,

238
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,290
but do you remember the name called Woo Jung Hoo?

239
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,430
Woo...

240
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,890
No. Is that somebody you know well?

241
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,710
Yes, a long time ago.

242
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,240
Is that so.

243
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,910
  I guess he wouldn't be him.  

244
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,190
- It was delicious! Thank you so much. 
 - Thank you!

245
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,470
  Wait, Soon Jung!  

246
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,680
  Lee Soon Jung, that girl!  

247
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,720
  How can I eat these precious buns?  

248
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,110
  I really like egg buns as well!  

249
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,910
  Thank you, Jung Hoo oppa!  

250
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,640
  I'll make more for you next time!  

251
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,640
  Thank you for the buns, oppa!  

252
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,820
- How much is for a bun? 
   - It's 1,000 won.  

253
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,070
- I have to lose some weight... Can I have one, please? 
   - Yes.  

254
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,100
Enjoy!

255
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,360
Welcome!

256
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,580
What's the famous menu in this place?

257
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,500
How about a meatball sandwich?

258
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,360
- I'll take that one. 
 - Okay!

259
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,080
Yes, Hwang Na Ro. It's me.

260
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,770
Hwang Na Ro?

261
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,680
Is that so? I'm almost here.

262
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,320
I got hungry, so I was about to eat something.

263
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:11,970
Oh! I can see you! Come into the sandwich shop.

264
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,080
Here is your sandwich. Enjoy!

265
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,080
You didn't eat lunch until now?

266
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,120
I was busy.

267
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,270
Oh? Na Ro oppa!

268
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,670
Hae Deun! Do you work here?

269
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,720
Aren't you here to meet with that person?

270
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,800
No, I'm not. One second. Hello?

271
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:46,710
I came into the sandwich shop. Where? Oh, I got it.

272
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,920
I was going to meet up with somebody, but this wasn't the place.

273
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,570
I'll come here again later. Good luck with your work, Hae Deun!

274
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,010
God damn it!

275
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:25,020
Anyway, before you pay for your sins to Pil Hong, you'd better act on your own.

276
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,650
It's the order from Pil Hong, right? You're not lying to me, are you?

277
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:38,150
Ha, Mi Ja Noonim, you became old. You got so suspicious about everything.

278
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,410
It's better to have less belly and suspicion when you get older.

279
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,970
My lunch break is over. I have to go.

280
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,210
That bastard...

281
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,730
How much do I have to believe?

282
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,460
Wow, what a big scale!

283
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,670
- Why are you hitting me for real! 
 - No, I didn't!

284
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,680
  Why are you getting upset with that!  

285
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:20,430
Kids, kids! You shouldn't fight with your friends. Let's stop fighting, okay?

286
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:26,870
- Oh, you made this very well. Can I try this on? 
   - Sure.  

287
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,180
Thank you!

288
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,060
How is it?

289
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,020
- I'm a bear! 
 - It's not funny! You're not scary!

290
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,450
Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Can you stand up?

291
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,090
I'm so sorry.

292
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,230
  Wow, she's very pretty!  

293
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,570
It can't be...

294
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,380
- Wait, one second. One second. 
   - James hyung! James hyung!  

295
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,560
- There's a delivery order! 
 - I'm coming!

296
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,940
Ajussi, my mask! My mask!

297
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,820
His name is James?

298
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,950
I guess he's a Korean American?

299
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,260
Ah, yes, Chief!

300
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,970
I'm sorry, I had been gone from the store for such a long time.

301
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,770
I'm sorry. I'll be back soon.

302
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:03,570
Today I was going to meet the guy who looked like Woo Jung Hoo.

303
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,460
Why did you buy so many groceries? And it looks like it's all for my favorite dishes!

304
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,030
- How did you know that right away! 
 - Of course, I do!

305
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,120
- I guess this is for me to eat a lot and have some energy? 
 - Yes.

306
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:36,070
Then, should we have a dinner party for the Samgwang people?

307
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:44,570
Tonight, we're going to have a special get-together for the Samgwang people. I want all of you to be there!

308
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,800
I just sent that message.

309
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,120
It's amazing!

310
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,870
     

311
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,550
  - Oh! Special dinner sounds great! 
 - Special dinner? What are we having?  

312
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,820
  Wow, it's a special dinner!  

313
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,230
An act... act...

314
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,840
A part-time acting job.

315
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:32,420
So father-- no, the president of this company, he got a personal problem,

316
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,630
so we need somebody to act as him in an important meeting.

317
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:42,470
Oh, my. I can't act as the president of a company.

318
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,260
I'll teach you how to do it! You did the phone call for me last time.

319
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,670
You can do it like that time, just do what I told you to do.

320
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,680
But I don't think I can do it.

321
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,370
I'm afraid to be in front of people as well.

322
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,270
This. You should pay me back for this.

323
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,230
If you do that part-time job for a day, you can pay back the entire price of this to me.

324
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:13,560
Not just this, but you should pay back the price for Ms. Lee as well.

325
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:18,920
The delivery part-time job that you're doing right now, can't pay both of us back at all!

326
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:26,580
So, I wrote everything that you have to do on this note.

327
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,120
You have to be familiar with this for the next few days and do what it says.

328
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,210
You don't even have to say that many things!

329
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:39,770
  James! Hyung! Come down for dinner!  

330
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,710
Yes, coming!

331
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,220
Okay?

332
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,990
You made the right choice, father.

333
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,800
This is so amazing!

334
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,240
Ms. Lee bought tons of groceries earlier today!

335
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,240
Mom, you must have worked so much to make all these foods! I should've come home early and helped you.

336
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:22,170
- That's not true. I'm the one who cooked two-thirds of tonight's dinner. 
 - Did you?

337
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,970
- Wow, that's a bit scary. Oh! All of a sudden, I remembered that I have a dinner plan. 
 - Uncle! That is with me! Let's go!

338
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,770
- I have to go as well. 
   - I'm just going to take the risk.  

339
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,790
Unni, is this a farewell party for Bit Chae?

340
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:41,829
My goodness. What farewell party?

341
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:45,289
Maybe it is for that, too?

342
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:48,439
My DNA test result came out today.

343
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,459
- How did it turn out? 
 - What do you think?

344
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:59,769
Don't act like you don't care. It came out that they match.

345
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,069
That's right.

346
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:03,779
- Unni. 
 - Noona.

347
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:09,159
Let's eat! I'm hungry. Let's eat first! Have a seat.

348
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:12,529
- Let's eat! 
 - Please, everybody, have a seat.

349
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:19,039
Wow, it looks so good!

350
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:21,699
Please, enjoy the meal!

351
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,579
  Wow, what a meal!  

352
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,779
Unni, then, are you leaving now..?

353
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:33,149
- Noona. 
 - I'm going to leave after dinner.

354
00:35:33,629 --> 00:35:37,319
  - Unni!   
 - Really?

355
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,239
It's a lie!

356
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,579
You surprised me. You asked for this.

357
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:53,339
I'm not going anywhere! So you guys should eat now, okay?

358
00:35:57,499 --> 00:36:00,699
- This is really good. 
    - It is.  

359
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:08,329
  You should eat slowly, mother.  

360
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,639
  Noonim.  

361
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:18,309
- Chae Woon, you made this namul dish deliciously. It's so good. 
   - Right?  

362
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,229
I think I'm talented.

363
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,259
It's really good.

364
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:39,389
Everyone, let me just say one thing.

365
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:46,739
I'm not going anywhere! I'm going to stay here for a long long time and going to be a ghost in Samgwang.

366
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:51,089
So, Lee Hae Deun, Lee Ra Hoon, you guys should eat now.

367
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,259
Have some food!

368
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:20,239
Moong-i, how is your stomach?

369
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:22,979
You got bloated!

370
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:28,089
Is it? Maybe I'm going to have some indigestion.

371
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:30,219
  Give me your hand.  

372
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,559
This part got stiff!

373
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,529
I'll massage you.

374
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,989
One, two!

375
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:44,759
Why are you tickling me! My goodness.

376
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,659
Give your hand to me.

377
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:05,119
It keeps bothering me, like indigestion.

378
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:14,119
The time when I was being mean to mom, and that time with the CEO.

379
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:21,259
I don't know why my heart is getting sharper these days.

380
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:33,459
Maybe it's because I'm having a hard time to forgive everybody.

381
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:38,799
I'm not quite sure.

382
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:41,339
Don't think about it too much.

383
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:48,499
If you have that feeling that you can't forgive somebody,

384
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,059
then it keeps makes you upset. It was like that to me as well.

385
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,359
Do you also have someone who you can't forgive?

386
00:38:57,529 --> 00:38:59,379
I had one.

387
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:01,479
What about now?

388
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:07,659
Now... I'm not quite sure as well.

389
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,349
That's the right answer. I'm not quite sure.

390
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:17,699
I can't know about that~

391
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,559
Isn't that right~?

392
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:24,909
Hwak Se's funny...

393
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:34,609
Kim Joon Woo?

394
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,879
We never had a chance to say hello. Nice to meet you. I'm the one who lives in the lower floor room, Hwang Na Ro.

395
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:44,629
It would've been nice to have dinner together tonight. But I heard you had a study group to go to?

396
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:52,859
If a person is talking to you, you should look at their face.

397
00:39:56,259 --> 00:40:00,329
Ha... Hey, boy?

398
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:05,699
Let me give you a word of advice as an older person.

399
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:10,179
There are basic manners that people should follow in group life.

400
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:14,789
  But I think you're lacking some of those manners.  

401
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:23,959
I'm sorry, Kim Joon Woo.

402
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:27,359
Oh, you hurt your forehead not your lips.

403
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,359
- Excuse me, Kim Joon Woo! 
 - What's going on?

404
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:37,799
It's so strange. Why does he not want to show his face?

405
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:43,159
- That's not true! I'm seeing his face all the time! 
 - Ah, because you guys use the same room.

406
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:47,549
Right, right. I was going to go out for a walk, but it's too cold.

407
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:50,079
- Hyung, have a good night. 
 - Ra Hoon.

408
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,629
That person is, right?

409
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,099
I'm sorry?

410
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,279
I mean, that person is a boy.

411
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:04,499
Yes, of course?

412
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:09,399
- Good night. 
 - Yes, you, too.

413
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:12,189
Good night!

414
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:25,959
They are so cute. How dare they think they can trick me?

415
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:37,059
Did somebody come in here?

416
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,999
Aigo, you must be uncomfortable to sleep here! I'm sorry the construction is taking a long time.

417
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:55,089
No, I'm fine! It's big and comfortable here.

418
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:58,869
- I'll do my best to finish the construction fast as I can! Sleep tight. 
 - Yes, good night!

419
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:01,339
Eems Hyung! Good night to you as well!

420
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,109
  Yes, good night!  

421
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,229
Why don't you go your way?

422
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:14,659
Isn't here gets cold at night? It gets pretty windy.

423
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:18,529
Are you worried about me?

424
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:26,769
No, I'm not. But it's a bit scary to sleep in an open area like this.

425
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,029
Good night!

426
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:32,659
You're scarier!

427
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:46,439
I'm not afraid of anything.

428
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,859
What's wrong with you?

429
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,559
  Why are you being like this!  

430
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:22,069
I'm not scared...

431
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:28,799
Keep open your eyes widely.

432
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:32,809
Don't relax your eyes the whole time.

433
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:40,649
It would be nice if the construction takes a longer time.

434
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:44,039
Why? It's getting colder, so I should finish as soon as possible.

435
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:49,659
Then, I can't share the room with you, Yoo Jae Hee.

436
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:55,709
Your father must be happy.

437
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:58,709
Because he has a thoughtful son like you.

438
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:07,559
Do you think I have a son as well?

439
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:11,249
It would be nice if I have a son like you.

440
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,459
I don't know.

441
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:25,619
You might haven't thought it was good even you have a son.

442
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:32,819
You might have hated him for not doing what you want him to do.

443
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:40,929
  Jung Min Jae, Jung Jae Hee! Have a good life! If we run into each other on a street, don't ever think to talk to me again!  

444
00:44:42,189 --> 00:44:44,629
  Jae Hee's father!  

445
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:52,389
"Let's not pretend to know each other," you might have cut the relationship off forever.

446
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:56,189
Don't you think so..?

447
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:04,949
Father.

448
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:07,579
You're living life so comfortably.

449
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:14,059
Sleep as you please, lose your memory as you please.

450
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:57,399
I should just use the bathroom on the second floor.

451
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:24,959
What's going on?

452
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:29,359
- What's wrong? 
 - G-! Gho-!

453
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,459
- G-! Gho-! 
 - Did you have a nightmare? Oh, no!

454
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:36,869
-  Get yourself together! What's that? Are you scared? 
 - I'm scared...

455
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:41,399
Oh, no. I think you had a nightmare.

456
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:51,229
Cha Ba Reun, are you sick?

457
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:54,269
I really have to go to the bathroom...

458
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:04,879
Ms. Lee Bit-Chae Woon is joining us again from today. Everybody, a round of applause!

459
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,759
Everybody! Welcome! Welcome!

460
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:13,859
  Welcome! Welcome!  

461
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:18,949
Thank you, everybody! I'll work my best!

462
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,279
♫  In the extravagant building forest  ♫

463
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:35,539
♫  You're walking with confidence, City Boy  ♫

I was going to make Bit Chae Woon fall in love with me... But it didn't go well.

472
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:27,159
She became too close with that bastard Woo Jae Hee.

473
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,759
So, I'm going to change the plan.

474
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:38,919
I'm going to try for a different target.

475
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:43,329
The other daughter of the CEO, Kim Jung Won.

476
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:50,279
Who knows? I might hit a jackpot in an unexpected place.

477
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:01,799
  I have a person that I like.  

478
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,079
I'm already nervous enough, and why is he being like that?

479
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:24,969
- How can you eat a triple-sized one? I didn't even know that exists! 
 - Me neither!

480
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:29,309
I should eat a lot to work harder.

481
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:33,159
I think you just splattered on me. I think it's all over my face!

482
00:49:33,259 --> 00:49:36,959
A mole! He got a mole on his face!

483
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:41,259
  - It's a mole! 
 - My goodness!  

484
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,179
I'm sorry.

485
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:48,269
- It's gone now. 
 - Is it?

486
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:51,869
Don't be affectionate in the workplace!

487
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:56,259
What! Everybody here knows about us, right?

488
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:59,299
  Of course!  

489
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:02,159
  Is there a woman in there that you're dating? 

490
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:06,559
You should wipe me here, too.

491
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:08,539
It was Bit Chae Woon?

492
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,469
Eat as much as you want.

493
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:22,109
Bit Chae Woon...

494
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,469
How can you take not just my mom, but Jae Hee oppa as well?

495
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:39,769
How can this happen?

496
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:44,639
How can this happen? How can this happen to me!

497
00:50:53,189 --> 00:50:57,399
Mi Ja Noonim. You should start the work today.

498
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:17,569
  I want to be your mother.  

499
00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:30,639
I knew it. You ate a lot, and now you're sleepy, aren't you?

500
00:51:30,819 --> 00:51:34,519
No, I'm not sleepy. I'm very happy that I'm full!

501
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:38,139
I have to run out first because I have to go somewhere.

502
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:41,959
Okay. Good luck with your work.

503
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:52,789
He just left without saying goodbye.

504
00:51:58,189 --> 00:52:00,419
Good luck with your work, Moong-i.

505
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:18,719
- Yes, it's Ms. Lee. 
   - Are you Lee Bit Chae Woon?  

506
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,579
Yes, speaking.

507
00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:26,029
  I'm a person who worked with Soon Jung before.  

508
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:51,519
- Were you close with my mom? 
 - Yes, of course!

509
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,579
I worked next to where Soon Jung unni used to work.

510
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,549
The young lady Jung Won's place.

511
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,529
Right.

512
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:01,479
So?

513
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:05,509
Soon Jung is having a hard time these days, isn't she?

514
00:53:06,739 --> 00:53:12,179
I really liked her a lot. I got help a lot from her as well.

515
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:16,969
I mean, why do good people have to suffer?

516
00:53:16,979 --> 00:53:19,749
It's a terrible world.

517
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:27,859
I'm sorry, but what is your point?

518
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,709
I'm sorry.

519
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:38,609
Don't blame Soon Jung too much.

520
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:45,049
She took care of the child who got abandoned by her real mother and did her best to raise!

521
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,679
I got so upset, so that's why I asked to see you.

522
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:56,639
That's so weird.

523
00:53:56,919 --> 00:54:01,489
How did you find me at the very moment?

524
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:07,029
Did my mom call you? Did she say that?

525
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:11,349
Or do you have a grudge over the CEO Kim Jung Won?

526
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,479
What grudge?

527
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:21,909
I just heard it from other people, and I just felt bad for Soon Jung.

528
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:28,459
I owe her a lot, so I'm returning my favor now.

529
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:43,849
Please put in your name and phone number.

530
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:52,469
You're not an easy person.

531
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:13,719
  She took care of the child who got abandoned by her real mother and did her best to raise!  

532
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,439
Don't you remember this place?

533
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:36,159
I'm here for the first time.

534
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:42,099
Actually, this is my father's company.

535
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:44,039
Really?

536
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:49,659
He owns such a big company!

537
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:53,919
Don't talk about this to Samgwang villa people.

538
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:59,689
My father has some issues, so I brought you here today instead.

539
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:02,449
- Yes. 
 - So, father--

540
00:56:03,339 --> 00:56:11,439
I mean James, you look very similar to my father, so people will think you're my father. Don't be too surprised.

541
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:17,659
C-Can I not do it now?

542
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:21,099
You have to pay back the money to me!

543
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:24,909
Right, I-I'll do it.

544
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,189
What did I say about the posture?

545
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:33,369
- Brother-in-law! 
 - Jae Hee!

546
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:35,339
Mom..?

547
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:38,999
- You better do it right. 
 - Yes.

548
00:56:40,409 --> 00:56:41,629
  Brother-in-law!  

549
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:45,359
- How have you been? We had been worrying about you! 
 - Uncle.

550
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:48,749
- What if somebody hears you! 
 - R-Right...

551
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,209
Mom, why are you here today?

552
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:57,119
Why are you here today?

553
00:56:57,409 --> 00:56:59,109
  Isn't she that beautiful woman?  

554
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:04,009
  I had something to talk about with my father about work stuff.  

555
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:09,489
How have you been?

556
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:21,859
  In this case, the notebook said...  

557
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:24,089
Yes?

558
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:27,579
Of course, I've been well!

559
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:34,459
President! Welcome.

560
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:40,409
- Is everything fine? 
 - Yes. I'll take you to the meeting room.

561
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:55,359
I thought he had been working on his mind, but he seems to be exactly the same.

562
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:04,759
  This new product has been developed to focus on improving in many areas. So... 

563
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:08,759
  Don't ever let your eyes be relaxed! Don't forget that!  

564
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:13,659
  Ah! My eyes! It really hurts!  

565
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:19,699
  We're developing something that you can get the benefit while you're sleeping. 

566
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:26,799
  These days,  lots of competitors are developing many similar products. Our new product is more ergonomic... 

567
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:31,189
Didn't I do a good job today?

568
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:35,469
Yes, you did great.

569
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:49,349
  I feel bad for my mom.  

570
00:58:57,089 --> 00:58:58,809
Are you okay?

571
00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:01,759
Y-Yes, I'm alright, Yoo Jae Hee.

572
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:04,419
Who the hell is that?!

573
00:59:04,779 --> 00:59:08,429
- Mom? 
 - Woo Jung Hoo! Woo Jae Hee!

574
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:10,459
- Come outside! 
 - What's is it, mom!

575
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,959
Get out of the car. Now!

576
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:18,649
Did I owe something to that beautiful woman as well?

577
00:59:18,649 --> 00:59:19,629
Are you not coming out?

578
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,859
- James. 
 - Yes?

579
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,439
Hold it tight. I'm sorry, mom!

580
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:34,409
- Woo Jung Hoo! Stop right there! 
 - Yoo Jae Hee! Yoo Jae Hee!

581
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:36,939
Yoo Jae Hee!

582
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:13,259
  I don't want to be your daughter, CEO.  

583
01:00:23,549 --> 01:00:25,909
Wow, it's so cold tonight!

584
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:34,679
Yes, Hae Deun. What's going on?

585
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:38,769
We are making Kimchi-jeon right now. So we wanted to know if you're almost home.

586
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:42,019
If it gets cold, it's not good. Come home soon!

587
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:45,169
Oh, kimchi-jeon! Sounds great. I'm almost home.

588
01:00:45,259 --> 01:00:49,559
Can you put cheese on my one? Yes.

589
01:00:53,459 --> 01:00:58,959
Come home soon? It's like we're a real family.

590
01:00:59,649 --> 01:01:01,539
  Na Ro.  

591
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:09,469
Pil Hong hyungnim?

592
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,969
How have you been?

593
01:01:11,049 --> 01:01:14,609
Wow, you look great, you bastard!

594
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:16,269
Are you good these days?

595
01:01:17,259 --> 01:01:20,519
H-How did you come here?

596
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:24,529
I know. You tried so hard to keep me in jail.

597
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,029
But how did I get here?

598
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:49,249
- Kimchi-jeon is the best on a rainy day! 
 - We need soju here.

599
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:50,959
We don't have soju at home!

600
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:54,609
- Hurry up and bring it! 
 - Here it comes!

601
01:01:56,499 --> 01:02:01,249
Why is it pouring so much. Oh! Kimchi-jeon!

602
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:03,469
Come, come! Have it now!

603
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:07,629
- It's so good! Who made this? 
    - I made it, your aunt. 

604
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:10,759
Unni, did you see Na Ro oppa on the way home?

605
01:02:11,169 --> 01:02:14,949
No, I didn't see him. I saw an umbrella was on the way here, so I took that with me.

606
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:18,689
- That's so strange. He said he was almost home. 
 - Yes.

607
01:02:18,689 --> 01:02:20,699
Maybe he's stopping somewhere?

608
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:25,749
- Where's mom? 
 - She's in her room. She said she don't want to eat this.

609
01:02:53,419 --> 01:02:55,119
Mom, what are you doing?

610
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:57,559
Just doing something.

611
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,979
  These are all mine.  

612
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:10,959
T-shirts, pillowcase, why are you ironing these?

613
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:14,059
I'm just ironing it.

614
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,699
Are you doing this to send me?

615
01:03:26,259 --> 01:03:34,059
That's why you're ironing stuff that doesn't need to be ironed.

616
01:03:34,229 --> 01:03:36,119
That's what it is, isn't it?

617
01:03:45,709 --> 01:03:50,249
Why are you being so shabby?

618
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:37,439
Don't do this, mom.

619
01:04:37,879 --> 01:04:41,059
Why are you doing this? Don't do this.

620
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:45,129
What are you doing? I just ironed those.

621
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:50,209
- When did I say you should leave right now? 
 - Please!

622
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:53,059
Don't do this.

623
01:04:53,499 --> 01:04:55,889
  Don't be like this!  

624
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,159
Chae Woon, why are you being like this?

625
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,549
You should go to your real mother if you met her.

626
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:09,789
That's the right thing to do. What are you doing here?

627
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,919
What is this?

628
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:15,629
What's the difference?

629
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:21,299
You're abandoning me as well. What is different now!

630
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:29,059
You can think about this however you want to.

631
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:34,659
I just ironed all of those... Give that to me!

632
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:39,669
- Stop that! Why are you being like this? 
 - Mom!

633
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:46,679
What's going on? Why are you guys being like this again?

634
01:05:47,439 --> 01:05:50,469
Mom! Unni!

635
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:08,449
CEO...

636
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:12,279
Young lady...

637
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:17,759
Let's go inside.

638
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:21,629
Seo Yeon...

639
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:44,059
Seo Yeon. Let's go home.

640
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:52,159
Let's go home... together with me.

641
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,369
My baby...

642
01:06:56,819 --> 01:07:01,739
Let's go home. Let's go home together.

643
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:05,959
  - CEO! 
 - Oh! Young lady!  

644
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:11,349
- Let's go home... 
 - Young lady!

645
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:13,589
CEO!

646
01:07:41,539 --> 01:07:47,469
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

647
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:55,119
♫  Like passing time, you can't stop the heart  ♫

648
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:59,959
♫  We're drawn to each other like the magnets  ♫ 
      

649
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:01,959
  Do you know Samgwang villa?  

650
01:08:01,959 --> 01:08:06,139
  - Mom! 
 - I heard you're dating the daughter of the villa's owner. Let's go, I want to see her face.  

651
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:08,159
  That was my underwear.  

652
01:08:08,179 --> 01:08:11,339
  This smell is Woo Jung Hoo's scent.  

653
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:14,039
  The contract has expired, so let's say goodbye here. Bye!  

654
01:08:14,059 --> 01:08:15,459
  Then, what about my 50,000 won?  

655
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:19,459
  - Let's go to the bank now. 
 - Ah! My arm just got broken. I can't go to the bank now. 

656
01:08:19,559 --> 01:08:25,159
  Yes, I'm just genuinely in love with Bit Chae Woon.  

657
01:08:25,379 --> 01:08:28,469
  - Do you think I trust a guy like you? 
 - Why don't you trust me!  

658
01:08:29,179 --> 01:08:31,359
  It's coming from a loving boyfriend.  

659
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,099
  Park Pil Hong is coming out of jail?  

660
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:37,919
  Why did you lie to me back then, mom? I know you're in Korea!
