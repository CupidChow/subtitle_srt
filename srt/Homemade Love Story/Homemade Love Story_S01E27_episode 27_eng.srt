1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,150
 

2
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,690
- Director.
- Hey.

3
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,350
Why are you here?

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,200
Hwang Na Ro.

5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,570
Director called me.

6
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,450
Hwang Na Ro.

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,990
Director, are you okay?

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,570
Chae Woon, get in.

9
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,450
Hey, you...

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,630
Get out.

11
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,400
Hwang Na Ro.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,770
Am I doing something wrong?

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,400
You guys, get out.

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,600
Mr. Lee. Go home already.

15
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,050
You're working late every day.

16
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,390
It's okay, Mr. Yoo.

17
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm so grateful to you and Mr. Woo

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,990
so I can work here like this.

19
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,160
I'll go home after cleaning this up.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,590
Okay. I'll check over there.

21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,460
Mr. Woo, a delivery.

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,360
I'll get it.

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,330
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

24
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,950
- Here you go.
- You're working so hard.

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,920
- Thank you.
- Good evening.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,890
 

27
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,620
 

28
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,800
 Please put that in the mailbox. 

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
Okay.

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,580
Please go inside.

31
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,480
Come in.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,380
It's all right. I was just passing by.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,850
Okay.

34
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,130
Please excuse me.

35
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,370
Sure.

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Please have a seat.

37
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,920
Long time no see, Mr. Woo.

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,680
I heard your business is doing well.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,270
Thank you. It's all thanks
 to your concern.

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,920
Min Jae is well, right?

41
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes, thanks to you.

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,390
But what brings you here 
to this house?

43
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,600
It's so strange.

44
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,040
My son Jae Hee is 
renting a room here.

45
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,620
So I came to see Jae Hee.

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,640
Is that so?

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,690
That's so weird.

48
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,580
How could this be?

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,990
When Mr. Woo moved in,

50
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,780
I didn't know he was 
Young Lady Min Jae's son.

51
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,290
I guess we were all meant to be.

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,030
Have a seat, Mr. Woo.

53
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,830
Okay, thank you.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,300
So what brings you here at this hour?

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,950
Well, as for me...

56
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,950
You must be here about 
Ms. Lee's oldest daughter.

57
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,820
You know about it, too?

58
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,320
About Bit Chae Woon?

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,470
Yes.

60
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,210
It's embarrassing...

61
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,660
but my son Jae Hee and 
her daughter are dating.

62
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,200
Aigoo. I can tell her everything, right?

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,360
Yes.

64
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,030
So...

65
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,070
I got to know about some
 important matters.

66
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,180
Is that right?

67
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,140
That's so weird.

68
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,260
Wasn't Jae Hee dating my Seo Ah?

69
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,190
- As far as I know, they weren't dating.
- What do you mean?

70
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,840
I mean... I don't think so.

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,950
No, they weren't dating, Chairwoman.

72
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,010
My son Jae Hee and 
your grandson Joon Ah

73
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,020
have been close friends
 since childhood.

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,190
Because of that, Seo Ah liked
 to hang around Jae Hee.

75
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,670
I'm pretty sure it's nothing
 more than that.

76
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,560
Oh, no. I'm sure of that.

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,090
In any case, Mr. Lee's daughter
 is your granddaughter.

78
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,140
I guess your family and mine are

79
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,030
meant to be one way or another.

80
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,890
You must be happy to find 
your long lost granddaughter.

81
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,860
Well, you know.

82
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,300
Ms. Lee's oldest daughter, 
Bit Chae Woon...

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,760
I know very well that she's 
kind and very upright.

84
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,420
Aigoo.

85
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,820
- Have some tea.
- Don't you know I hate ginger tea?

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,890
Aigoo, this precious ginger tea.

87
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,080
I get to drink this again.

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,310
Chairwoman, try some.

89
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,450
Ms. Lee personally made this tea.

90
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,570
The scent is so deep, 
and it tastes delicious.

91
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,930
It feels like it prevents you 
from catching a cold.

92
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,810
Where are you?

93
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,600
Bring the car around.

94
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,980
I said what I needed to say already.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,400
I'll get going now.

96
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,300
Mr. Woo, aren't you leaving?

97
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,390
I'll go after seeing Jae Hee.

98
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,470
I need to discuss something
 with my son.

99
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,470
Jae Hee says he's coming home soon.

100
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,870
I see. Is that so?

101
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,100
All right. I'll go now.

102
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,060
You don't need to walk me out.

103
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,510
Goodbye, Chairwoman.

104
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,780
See you again, Chairwoman.

105
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,650
All right.

106
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,540
Say hello to Min Jae from me.

107
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,040
Okay.

108
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,690
Mr. Woo.

109
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,990
What happened?

110
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,780
Did you get your memory back?

111
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,750
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,350
I got my memory back 
while I was hospitalized.

113
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,140
I wanted to tell you 
last time I was here.

114
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,420
But when I saw you and everyone here,

115
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,780
I liked being James like before,

116
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,120
so I couldn't tell you the truth.

117
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,710
Gosh, no, Mr. Woo.

119
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,200
No need to apologize.

120
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,690
I totally understand.

121
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,600
Really?

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,500
Thank you.

123
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,010
I'll give you another ginger tea.

124
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,820
Aigoo, thank you.

125
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,030
Sure.

126
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,130
Geez!

127
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,220
Of all people, why meet 
Min Jae's husband here?

128
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,740
Geez.

129
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,390
I wanted to tell him off 
to teach his son,

130
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,780
but I couldn't say it since it's 
 admitting that Seo Ah got dumped.

131
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,040
Wait...

132
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,930
is Lee Soon Jung, by chance...

133
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,550
saying some nonsense to him?

134
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,890
Mr. Park.

135
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,280
What's taking you so long?

136
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,200
Geez, so frustrating!

137
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,590
Hurry up!

138
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,560
I should fire him or something.

139
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,800
- No good chauffeurs or secretaries.
- It's her.

140
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,420
Ahjumma!

141
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,030
Oh, my. Hello.

142
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,650
Gosh, I'm Min Jae.

143
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,740
I used to live next door to you.

144
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,600
I can't believe I run into you here.

145
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,100
Min Jae?

146
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,970
You're Min Jae?

147
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,820
Yes, Ahjumma.

148
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,460
I heard you're "Chairwoman" now.

149
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,710
I saw you at Jung Won's 
event at work last time,

150
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,500
but I didn't get to say hello.

151
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,530
You're healthy, right?

152
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,840
Why?

153
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,180
Do I look sick?

154
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,840
Gosh, no.

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,260
Gosh, you still have such 
a lovely complexion.

156
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,580
People used to say that 
Jung Won is so beautiful

157
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,310
because she takes after her mom.

158
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,310
If she did take after me completely,

159
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,980
she would've made Miss Korea.

160
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,220
She took after her father.

161
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,790
I know, right?

162
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,230
Gosh, what a strange day.

163
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,060
I run into you couple as a set.

164
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,410
Excuse me?

165
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,150
So, what brings you here?

166
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,170
I'm sorry, Chairwoman.
 I'll drive you home.

167
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm busy, so I'll get going.

168
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,710
Goodbye, Chairwoman.

169
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,640
Can't believe I'm meeting all of them.

170
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
Geez!

171
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,570
Meeting us as a set?

172
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,700
Is she saying she met 
Jung Hoo somewhere?

173
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,920
Well, then. I'll get going now.

174
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,610
You won't see Mr. Woo?

175
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,680
Oh, yes.

176
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,620
Actually, that was a lie.

177
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,210
What?

178
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,440
My gosh.

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,930
If I just leave,

180
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,330
I was afraid Chairwoman might 
say something to upset you.

181
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,160
I see what you did.

182
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,040
Did you two have something
 important to discuss

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,370
and did I interrupt?

184
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,530
Gosh, no, Mr. Woo.

185
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,370
Thank you.

186
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,490
Then you really were passing
 by and stopped by?

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,940
Actually...

188
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,570
that's a lie, too.

189
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,040
My goodness.

190
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,730
While working in my office,

191
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,530
I kept thinking of the days I spent here.

192
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,930
I thought I'd visit Hwak Se, 
so I came back.

193
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,450
Oh, I see.

194
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,570
But Hwak Se is out tonight.

195
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,830
I do think he might be home soon.

196
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,160
Well...

197
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
would it be okay if I tell others here at

198
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,180
Samgwang Villa that

199
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,630
I got my memory back?

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,140
I still have a desire to visit here

201
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,080
more freely or something.

202
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,860
That's how I feel.

203
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,110
If it's okay with you, Ms. Lee.

204
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,100
Of course.

205
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,540
I totally understand how you feel.

206
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,550
I'm sure Mr. Woo also wants you 
to visit us comfortably

207
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,340
and that's why he didn't tell me

208
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,410
about you getting your memory back.

209
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,660
Yes.

210
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,340
I think so, too.

211
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,440
Mr. Woo, then I'll shut
 my mouth for now, too.

212
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,590
Thank you.

213
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,640
Oh, my. Hwak Se must be home.

214
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,970
Hello.

215
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,750
Aigoo.

216
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,480
Soon Jung.

217
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,540
Young Lady Min Jae.

218
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,200
I came in because your 
door was left open.

219
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,640
Hi, Min Jae.

220
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,450
- I just came to see Hwak Se...
- He's here to see...

221
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,730
I get to see you here.

222
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,680
Good to see you, Woo Jung Hoo.

223
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,160
I was so grateful to Soon Jung...

224
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,230
She takes good care of Jae Hee...

225
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,650
and you took care of him, too.

226
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,110
I never got a chance to
 say thank you.

227
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,240
I felt so bad all of a sudden, 
and that's why I'm here...

228
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,750
Gosh, I'm glad you came, Young Lady.

229
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,550
Have a seat.

230
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,780
Mr. Woo isn't home yet.

231
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,610
Oh, really?

232
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,250
Aigoo.

233
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,080
Thank you.

234
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,380
Have a seat.

235
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,900
You already had your tea.

236
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,870
I'll come back next time.

237
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,620
Now that I think about it, 
I was too impulsive.

238
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm like this these days. 
My emotions are all over the place.

239
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,560
I must be an adolescent again.

240
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,300
Gosh, but you're still here.

241
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,050
Have some tea before you go.

242
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,380
Yes, please do. 
Ms. Lee's tea is so good.

243
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,630
I already drank two cups.

244
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,020
Gosh, did you?

245
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,340
Then more reason for me
 to drink it next time.

246
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,100
James, in your stomach,

247
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,530
ginger tea must be making 
waves, "swoosh, swoosh."

248
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,340
If I drink it, you have to 
drink one more cup.

249
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,560
Gosh, it's not like that.

250
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,770
What do you mean waves?

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,870
Why do I keep going back and forth?

252
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,820
Jang Seo Ah.

253
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,800
Are you better now?

254
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm fine.

255
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,980
I'll say hello to the CEO.

256
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,980
Whatever.

257
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,670
Hwang Na Ro.

258
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,220
You should go home.

259
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,290
Since I'm here, I'd like to 
say hello to the CEO.

260
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,240
Just go.

261
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,330
Hwang Na Ro, come in.

262
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,840
Let's go in.

263
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,240
Hello.

264
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,560
Seo Ah, what happened? 
Are you okay?

265
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,860
Yes...

266
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,470
- Hello, CEO.
- Jae Hee, you're here.

267
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,320
Hello, CEO.

268
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,070
Hwang Na Ra came to pick me up.

269
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,200
He came all the way here,

270
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,030
so I thought he should 
say hello to you.

271
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,560
Seo Ah, did you drink...

272
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,440
Did you drink?

273
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,950
I wasn't going to, but...

274
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,520
something set me off.

275
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,510
Were you all together?

276
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,640
Oh, no.

277
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,650
Seo Ah and I were hanging out

278
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,060
and it ended up like this.

279
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,500
I joined them by coincidence.

280
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,760
I was in the area for work.

281
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,820
I'll get going now.

282
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,180
Hwang Na Ro...

283
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,060
it's your first time at 
our house, right?

284
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,700
Have some tea before you go.

285
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,110
That's okay, right, Mom?

286
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,910
Of course, he can.

287
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,480
- Have a seat over here.
- No.

288
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,250
Hwang Na Ro and I'll drink separately.

289
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,800
I need to talk to him.

290
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,740
Should we drink on the balcony?

291
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,260
Sure, let's do that.

292
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,050
Seo Ah.

293
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,040
Let's drink here together.

294
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,120
Ms. Jo, prepare some tea, please.

295
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,710
Seo Ah.

296
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,700
Thank you.

297
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,200
I met Seo Ah because I've been 
worried about her lately.

298
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,300
But...

299
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,150
Did Seo Ah lose her temper 
all of a sudden?

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Yes.

301
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,040
Gosh...

302
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,410
You must've been taken aback.

303
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,920
She's been fine for a while,

304
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,370
but she keeps going off lately.

305
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,630
So I have a lot to worry 
about these days.

306
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,880
I'm sure you do.

307
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,830
I didn't even get to say hi to you
 officially while dating Chae Woon.

308
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,750
I'm sorry, CEO.

309
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,100
It feels so strange hearing such 
a thing coming from Jae Hee.

310
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,810
You should've told me in advance 
that you're meeting Woo Jae Hee.

311
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,810
Then I would've shown up earlier.

312
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,630
Why should I do that?

313
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,120
Are we that close?

314
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,820
How long should I stay here?

315
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
I'm sure you know.

316
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,460
Until Woo Jae Hee leaves?

317
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,860
I like that you're so quick, Hwang Na Ro.

318
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,300
But...

319
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,600
at times...

320
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,980
that scares me quite a bit.

321
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,260
Geez, that's too much.

322
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,870
Just see me in a good light.

323
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,390
Hwang Na Ro is a bad guy.

324
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,990
He even has a fraud record.

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,990
 Closer I get to you, Jae Hee oppa
 will get anxious, right? 

326
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,300
I'll try to see you in a good light.

327
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,140
While you're trying,

328
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,100
I'd like it if you see me as a person.

329
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,510
Not as someone to 
shake up Woo Jae Hee.

330
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,020
After seeing you as you are,
 and then what?

331
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,560
After that?

332
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,840
After that...

333
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,110
I'd like you to like me.

334
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,000
Just like the way I like you, Director.

335
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,190
The thing that you promised. 
Is that going well?

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,780
Getting Bit Chae Woon out of here.

337
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,050
Yes, I'm looking for the right timing.

338
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,100
Bit Chae Woon will be
 leaving this house soon.

339
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,780
You can leave now, Hwang Na Ro.

340
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,260
Geez.

341
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,180
Let me stay a little longer.

342
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,360
I endured being cold all this time.

343
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,780
Okay?

344
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,170
Young Lady, Mr. Woo is leaving.

345
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,390
Hwang Na Ro.

346
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
I told Seo Ah everything.

347
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,340
That you have a fraud record.

348
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,120
But Seo Ah knew already.

349
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,890
Is it true?

350
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,330
Yeah.

351
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,710
She says that's not 
an issue for her at all.

352
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,000
 Jae Hee, I sent you a picture of
 Park Pil Hong to your work. 

353
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,270
 It looks like he served time 
with Hwang Na Ro. 

354
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,200
- Hey, Hwang Na Ro.
- Now what?

355
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,350
Do you know Park Pil Hong?

356
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,090
Who?

357
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,880
Park Pil Hong.

358
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,100
You know, right?

359
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,040
Who's that?

360
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,680
Geez, I'm leaving.

361
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,760
Don't hold me back.

362
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,840
Hwang Na Ro...

363
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,350
He got his information in jail.

364
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,260
The fact that Chae Woon 
comes from a rich family.

365
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,200
 When you get out, 
find Lee Soon Jung. 

366
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,800
 She knows where 
my daughter is. 

367
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,960
 She could be living with her. 

368
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,790
 I must find my daughter. 

369
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,660
 She's the bundle of money. 

370
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,400
How did that jerk 
Woo Jae Hee find out?

371
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,810
What are you doing?

372
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,630
By chance...

373
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,420
ever since having amnesia...

374
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,470
Since what?

375
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,700
Do you think you have 
multiple personalities?

376
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,220
What?

377
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,640
You know how it is.

378
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,690
Inside one person lives
 numerous personalities.

379
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,300
So, inside "Young Shik,"

380
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,330
there are happy Young Shik,
 shy Chul Soo,

381
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,860
cunning Man Bok are all inside.

382
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,510
Isn't that what you have?

383
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,180
Since having amnesia,

384
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,500
Woo Jung Hoo and James 
are inside your body.

385
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,970
That's not it.

386
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,630
I just talk like old James whenever
 I come to this neighborhood.

387
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,780
That's what I mean.
 It's the same thing.

388
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,840
What nonsense.

389
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,440
 Aigoo, Eems hyung. Ta-da! 

390
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,660
See?

391
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,500
- James!
- Yes?

392
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,460
What are you doing right now?

393
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,930
Wait for me! You said 
you'd give me a ride.

394
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,520
Don't worry.

395
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,500
I won't say anything to 
Samgwang about you two dating.

396
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,360
Gosh, there's no need for that.

397
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,880
But we're still...

398
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,290
Hey.

399
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,010
You're ridiculous, Cha Ba Reun.

400
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,690
Who's dating whom right now?

401
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,650
Gosh, seriously. That's a 
huge misunderstanding.

402
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,580
This?

403
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,120
One of my patients brought it 
to me to thank me.

404
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,130
What?

405
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,600
I mean...

406
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,960
Hey, of course...

407
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,610
as Samgwang people together...

408
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,890
to be united, we saw a movie...

409
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,800
together. Can't we? Right, Hwak Se?

410
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,530
Oh, yes.

411
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,450
That's right. She's right.

412
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,640
Nah, that's not true.

413
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,380
When I saw you two with
 James ahjussi...

414
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,270
you definitely admitted it, 
Uncle Hwak Se.

415
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,200
You did?

416
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,430
I did?

417
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,970
Ba Reun, you misunderstood.

418
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,610
You misunderstood that.

419
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,030
You misunderstood. 
That's a misunderstanding.

420
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,310
I know. She's a bit dense.

421
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,780
I'm right. You didn't see them then.

422
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,080
Hey, you two must be dating since 
you watched a movie together.

423
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,610
- Yes.
- No, we're not.

424
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,470
What? Why are your answers different?

425
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,240
Of course, they answer differently.

426
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,330
Lee Hae Deun.

427
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,410
Cha Ba Reun was stuck on 
Lee Ra Hoon from the get-go.

428
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,880
You still haven't given up on Ra Hoon?

429
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,800
- Well, um...
- I'll go ahead.

430
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,000
- Well...
- Cha Ba Reun!

431
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,320
Look at her. She takes off 
because she's cornered.

432
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,210
But what's everyone doing here?

433
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,530
Did you all come home together?

434
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,150
Yes, probably.

435
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,760
- We ran into each other on the way.
- Yeah!

436
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,590
We met on the way, by chance.

437
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,350
How could that be? 
How could everyone meet?

438
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,240
Why can't that happen?

439
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
You just bumped into us here.

440
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,490
Be quiet. Let's go home.

441
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,990
How dare Cha Ba Reun like 
my precious brother?

442
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,260
Cha Ba Reun, I...

443
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,430
♫  In the pitch-black road of mine  ♫

444
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,400
I can see how Ba Reun 
would be upset.

445
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,960
You pretend not to be 
together when you are.

446
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,780
Well, it's still...

447
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,540
My situation is a bit...

448
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,610
Aigoo, why? What's wrong 
with your situation?

449
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,230
Our handsome and cool Ra Hoon.

450
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,420
And you're both 
Seohan University students.

451
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,980
Well, that's not it...

452
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,540
♫  A night without anyone to
 lean on or to talk to  ♫

453
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,850
♫  I'm comforting myself, 
this tearfully lonely night  ♫

454
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,520
I know...

455
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,440
how Ba Reun feels.

456
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,780
My Jung...

457
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,770
 Who's dating whom right now? 

458
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,620
is like that.

459
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,250
I had forgotten my place for a minute.

460
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,040
That's it.

461
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,120
♫  Life is so hard  ♫

462
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,580
♫  Youth these days are
 having a hard time  ♫

463
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,720
♫  Well, just living with that in my heart  ♫

464
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,800
 My mouth. 

465
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,560
 Did I deny too adamantly? 

466
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,710
Geez, whatever.

467
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,300
Hey, Cha Ba Reun.

468
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,360
Aren't you going to clean up? 
We should go to sleep.

469
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,660
What? Why?

470
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,470
Auntie.

471
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,020
Oh, yeah, right.

472
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,420
You told me to call you "unni" 
when we're alone.

473
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,260
What about it?

474
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,300
Aren't we roommates, Unni?

475
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,200
My goodness.

476
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,560
Rather than roommates, 
you're crashing in my room.

477
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,390
But I still pay my rent.

478
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,720
How about you, Unni?

479
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,260
What did you say?

480
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,890
Well, if you and I share the cleaning,

481
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,820
it will be much more effective.

482
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,100
I really don't like you today.

483
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,700
Ba Reun.

484
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,620
You said you need a rag, right?

485
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,570
You should've called me. 
I would've come down.

486
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,140
I had to come up anyway.

487
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,780
Thank you.

488
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,880
You said you ran into Hwak Se
 in the theater, right?

489
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,110
Yes.

490
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,080
I see. He said it's his day off today.

491
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,870
He sent to a movie.

492
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,850
So was he there alone?

493
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,570
No, he wasn't alone.

494
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,860
Well...

495
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,200
Ba Reun, you were going
 to clean, right?

496
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,420
Shall we clean?

497
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,830
I'll do it. I should clean tonight.

498
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,400
You must be tired if you 
went to a movie. I'll clean.

499
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,330
Oh, my. Man Jung, what's going on?
 You're cleaning?

500
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,040
Yeah, well.

501
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,910
- Right.
- So...

502
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,870
Who was Hwak Se with?

503
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,500
Was he with a woman by chance?

504
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,850
- Well, Uncle Hwak Se...
- Wait...

505
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,330
Unni.

506
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,100
We have to clean up. 
It will get dusty. Go to sleep.

507
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,920
- Come on.
- Go, Unni. Goodnight.

508
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,210
What are you doing, Man Jung?

509
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,050
What do you mean?

510
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,460
- Go.
- Man Jung, what are you doing?

511
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,580
Gosh.

512
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,800
Hwak Se.

513
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,320
What's going on?

514
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,670
I think I should clean up. Right?

515
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,910
You've cleaned a lot all this time. 
Get some rest.

516
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,320
Whoa.

517
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,730
Nice.

518
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,950
All right.

519
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,260
I'll clean up.

520
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,130
You cleaned a lot all this time.

521
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,690
I'll clean up your desk, too.

522
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,600
- Yes, over there.
- Yeah.

523
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,470
Come in.

524
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,360
Aigoo.

525
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,730
 

526
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,700
Are you sure this is your house?

527
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,620
It is.

528
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,490
What's that?

529
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,210
Can't you read?

530
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,250
"Min Jae! Enjoy!"

531
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm saying, let's enjoy.

532
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,450
While I lived with you, 
I never enjoyed life.

533
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,740
Homemaking, tough in-laws,

534
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,210
and supporting you.

535
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,470
 

536
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,010
Is that expensive?

537
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,360
Isn't it cool?

538
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,450
Make one for yourself.

539
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,850
What would be good?

540
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,420
"Smile, Woo Jung Hoo!"

541
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,750
"Where is James?" Oh, that's great.

542
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,970
"Where is that kind James?"

543
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,390
Nice.

544
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,960
I'll order one for you.

545
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,900
It's a gift for getting your memory back.

546
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,550
Forget it. It'll cost electricity.

547
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,450
It doesn't cost that much.

548
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,860
What would be good?

549
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,560
It's night, so for him to sleep well...

550
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,990
Chamomile will be nice.

551
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,860
Chamomile...

552
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:16,150
You didn't tell Soon Jung about 
getting your memory back, did you?

553
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,560
Jae Hee said he won't tell 
Samgwang Villa for now.

554
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,600
She knows now. Only Soon Jung knows.

555
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,100
What?

556
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,360
She knows? Since when?

557
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,300
Did you tell her yourself?

558
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,670
No.

559
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,360
I ran into Jung Won's mother earlier.

560
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,790
- I said hello, so...
- Jung Won's mom?

561
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,240
I ran into her in the alley, too.

562
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,100
No wonder she said something about
 meeting us as a set and whatnot.

563
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,780
So, did Jung Won's mom 
come to see Soon Jung?

564
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,090
Why?

565
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,950
That's a bit...

566
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,730
It seemed a little weird,

567
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,730
so I was going to tell you.

568
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,310
Between Chairwoman 
and Lee Soon Jung...

569
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,380
Right, right, right?

570
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,350
I know. Something is off.

571
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,380
I felt it in my gut earlier, too.

572
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,910
A while ago, Jung Won...

573
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,600
Honey, you hear that Bit Chae Woon

574
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,370
is Jung Won's daughter?

575
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, I heard.

576
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,400
Yeah, right. You  lived in Samgwang Villa, 
so I'm sure you heard.

577
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,830
There are all kinds of information
 is overflowing there.

578
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,110
That's right.

579
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,040
So what about a while ago?

580
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,250
A while ago, when I was
 talking to Jung Won,

581
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,340
something didn't sit right.

582
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,150
Something didn't sit right?

583
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,410
Soon Jung...

584
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,010
didn't tell Jung Won clearly

585
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,750
how she came to raise Bit Chae Woon.

586
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,070
What?

587
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,450
Why would she do that?

588
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,380
That's why it's so weird.

589
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,400
Soon Jung is so kind. 
She can't even lie.

590
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,940
A long time ago, Jung Won, 
Soon Jung, and I

591
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,250
were making french toasts
 in our room over a gas stove,

592
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,630
and my mom caught us.

593
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,200
Soon Jung took the 
blame all by herself

594
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,300
and got into so much 
trouble with my mom.

595
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,550
And you're the one who
 came up with the idea.

596
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,200
- Right?
- Yeah, right, right.

597
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,360
I'm always the villain, huh?

598
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,510
So finish what you were saying.

599
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,660
Huh?

600
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,470
What was I talking about?

601
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,220
Anyway, so...

602
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,310
So, what did Jung Won's mom say?

603
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,900
Well, she didn't say much.

604
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,440
Did she not say much
 because I was there?

605
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,040
But I noticed that Chairwoman 
seemed to be making

606
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,630
some type of threat to 
Ms. Soon Jung.

607
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,170
"Ms. Soon Jung? Ms. Soon Jung?"

608
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,430
Do you call her that, "Ms. Soon Jung"?

609
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,330
Oh, no.

610
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,370
It's just my old habit.

611
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,590
Right, "Ms. Soon Jung" to you.

612
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,220
"Ms. Soon Jung" to you.

613
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,040
I'm just "Min Jae."

614
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,130
Soon Jung and I are the same age.

615
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,010
You call her "Ms. Soon Jung," 
and you call me "Min Jae."

616
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,410
I got so pissed.

617
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,140
And that dictionary!

618
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,740
That red dictionary.

619
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,650
I had picked it out for myself, and 
you gave that to Soon Jung as a gift.

620
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,720
Yet you tell me, "Min Jae, you buy one."

621
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,280
I got so mad.

622
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,590
I got so pissed over that red dictionary.

623
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,660
I'll gather all the red dictionaries
 in the world and

624
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,770
I'll burn them all. 
Burn all the dictionaries.

625
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,840
What are you doing, Honey?

626
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,250
Leaving?

627
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,610
I'll go now.

628
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,870
You won't drink tea?

629
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,339
As you said, my stomach is
 full of ginger tea.

630
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,377
Lock your door.

631
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:45,077
Be careful going home.

632
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:50,517
He still gets miffed all the same.

633
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:53,347
Why is he always 
Woo Jung Hoo with me?

634
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:55,787
Why not turn into James?

635
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,647
I miss James.

636
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:00,887
Oh, my.

637
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:02,527
What's wrong with me? No.

638
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:03,607
Geez.

639
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:06,277
I was concerned if her
 depression was getting better.

640
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:08,037
She always nags so much.

641
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:10,127
Geez, gosh!

642
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:17,527
She was never that talkative.

643
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:24,397
Is that manic?

644
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:39,147
 Why don't you muster up the courage? 

645
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:41,807
 That's why I told you! 

646
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:45,387
 Before something terrible 
happens, you should leave. 

647
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,197
Mother, you didn't turn
 in for the night?

648
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:56,457
Hi. Mr. Woo, you're late.

649
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:58,217
Yes, I'm late.

650
00:35:58,217 --> 00:35:59,627
Is everything okay?

651
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:00,887
Yes.

652
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:03,237
Mr. Woo.

653
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:07,767
Did you see Chae Woon tonight?

654
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:09,797
Yes.

655
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:11,317
Chae Woon is fine.

656
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:14,007
I dropped her off at home.

657
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,707
Is that so?

658
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:22,687
I'm so grateful that you're 
by Chae Woon's side...

659
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:24,397
Mr. Woo.

660
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:30,277
Oh, yeah. Your parents 
stopped by tonight.

661
00:36:30,277 --> 00:36:33,017
My mom and dad? To see me?

662
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:35,257
They didn't say they were coming over.

663
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:39,157
I think your father stopped by 
because he misses this place.

664
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,827
And your mom stopped by to say hello.

665
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,657
She even brought me flowers.

666
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:48,397
Two of them bumped into
 each other here by chance.

667
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:51,257
I see. That's so neat.

668
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:52,987
Of all days, both of them came tonight.

669
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:54,587
I know.

670
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,817
Oh, yeah.

671
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:59,617
Your father got his memory back.

672
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,037
Aigoo, how did you know...

673
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:04,807
Your father told me.

674
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:09,027
For now, I'll keep that to myself.

675
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,137
I see.

676
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:12,557
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you.

677
00:37:12,557 --> 00:37:15,987
By chance, if my dad missed 
here and wanted to visit,

678
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:19,187
I thought it'd be nice if it were 
like before. So I didn't tell you.

679
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:20,817
I know, I know.

680
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,537
I understand how you feel, Mr. Woo.

681
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:26,697
Your father knew everything.

682
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,117
My dad does?

683
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:34,817
Gosh, it's so weird.

684
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:39,347
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo.

685
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:41,607
Why?

686
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:44,027
No...

687
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:47,047
James?

688
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,627
Yes?

689
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:55,407
It's weird. So weird.

690
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,877
 Do you think you have
 multiple personalities? 

691
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:02,707
Is that it?

692
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:07,677
Geez, why is it so cold?

693
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:09,857
Geez.

694
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:12,007
So cold.

695
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:14,267
 

696
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:16,187
Geez...

697
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:22,947
If he were James, it'd be easier
 for me to call him.

698
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:26,847
Gosh, whatever.

699
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,657
 Moong-i, I got home safely. 

700
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:41,077
 Sleeping? 

701
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:48,367
You didn't sleep yet?

702
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,217
You got home okay.

703
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:52,017
Did you take a taxi?

704
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:54,607
No. I took the bus.

705
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:58,147
It's fun to look out from
 a bus at night.

706
00:38:58,147 --> 00:38:59,907
It's fun.

707
00:39:01,277 --> 00:39:03,247
Did Hwang Na Ro go with you?

708
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,447
He took off first.

709
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:07,087
He walks so fast.

710
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,597
But you know...

711
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,157
I'm worried that...

712
00:39:11,157 --> 00:39:14,607
Hwang Na Ro is close to Seo Ah.

713
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:15,817
I know.

714
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:18,387
I'll have to keep my eye 
on him at work.

715
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:23,707
I wanted to walk you out to 
the street earlier, but I couldn't.

716
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,397
I know you wanted to follow me out.

717
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,057
I noticed all that.

718
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:32,507
But that kept following me.

719
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:36,197
- What?
 - Your heart. 

720
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,457
What the heck?

721
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:41,817
We didn't get to see each other that 
much tonight. So let's meet tomorrow.

722
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:43,377
Tomorrow?

723
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:46,957
How about if I have to
 work late tomorrow?

724
00:39:46,957 --> 00:39:49,837
Then shall we meet early in
 the morning before you get to work?

725
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:52,237
As if you're headed to 
the library. How about it?

726
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:07,537
 Hello? Moong-i? 

727
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:09,477
 You don't want to meet too early? 

728
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:12,387
Were you a late sleeper?

729
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:15,157
No, it's fine. Let's meet.

730
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:16,277
 Good. 

731
00:40:16,277 --> 00:40:18,157
 Very good. 

732
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:31,687
 
Why is Dad calling me?

733
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,707
Hello?

734
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:39,417
Dad.

735
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,577
What do I need to press?

736
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:42,797
 What? 

737
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:45,417
The boiler is old.

738
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:48,347
It won't run, but the water is leaking.

739
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:50,057
What do I need to press?

740
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:51,387
Oh, that...

741
00:40:51,387 --> 00:40:53,577
Are you in the boiler room?

742
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:54,607
 Yeah. 

743
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:58,827
 You have the boiler
 front cover open, right? 

744
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:01,437
 There's a switch on the bottom. 

745
00:41:01,437 --> 00:41:04,187
 - It's not yellow. It's the red one next to it. 
- Wait, wait.

746
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:06,267
The front cover?

747
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:14,197
Hello?

748
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:16,517
Dad, the water...

749
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,187
Hello?

750
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,397
Geez.

751
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,047
What? What?

752
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,477
James.

753
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:27,637
- Yeah?
- What did I tell you earlier?

754
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:29,697
I said there's a red one next
 to the yellow button.

755
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,617
What happens if you press this?

756
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:33,257
It works.

757
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,397
It's working. It's working.

758
00:41:35,397 --> 00:41:38,857
So you should've looked 
over it carefully.

759
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:42,207
I know. It's working, Yoo Jae Hee.

760
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,607
I won't get cold at night now.

761
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:47,237
Sleep warmly tonight.

762
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:56,737
Yeah, right.

763
00:41:56,737 --> 00:41:59,577
It's Dad. I keep thinking he's James.

764
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:04,607
The boiler is on, so it will warm up soon.

765
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:09,477
Did you come like that?

766
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:11,257
You seemed to be in a rush.

767
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:12,657
What rush?

768
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:16,377
That thing attacked me. 
So I was startled.

769
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:19,787
Geez, so dirty. What's this?
 Where did you get this?

770
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,287
It was on top of the boiler.

771
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:23,227
Who put that there?

772
00:42:23,227 --> 00:42:25,837
There's no way something
 like this is in our house.

773
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,217
Geez, it's so dirty.

774
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:29,877
Your mom probably left it behind.

775
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:31,117
I see.

776
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:33,037
- I'll throw it out.
- Leave it.

777
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:35,017
I'm sure she spent money on it.

778
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:40,587
I'm glad the boiler is working now.

779
00:42:40,587 --> 00:42:42,897
You could've let me know 
over the phone.

780
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:45,447
Why run over here? What a hassle.

781
00:42:46,427 --> 00:42:49,327
 You'll never say, "thanks." 

782
00:42:49,327 --> 00:42:51,617
I'll go now.

783
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:53,617
Wait.

784
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:55,417
Well...

785
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:58,557
I was walking by...

786
00:42:58,557 --> 00:43:02,697
and stopped by Samgwang Villa 
for a quick moment.

787
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:04,527
Yeah, I heard.

788
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:06,937
I don't think it was that quick.

789
00:43:06,937 --> 00:43:09,627
It was quick. Very quick.

790
00:43:09,627 --> 00:43:10,797
Okay.

791
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:13,927
But...

792
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:17,637
CEO Kim Jung Won's mother

793
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,387
came to see Ms. Lee.

794
00:43:21,107 --> 00:43:23,567
CEO Kim Jung Won's mother is...

795
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,697
Chairwoman? Why?

796
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:27,447
I don't know why.

797
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:29,367
I felt like...

798
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:31,467
Ms. Lee was going through...

799
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:35,297
a difficult situation.

800
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:37,797
Well, she did go through a tough time.

801
00:43:37,797 --> 00:43:40,297
She had to send off Chae Woon
 to her birth mom.

802
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:42,097
The way I see it...

803
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:48,087
I think she's going through 
something else besides that.

804
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,387
Really?

805
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:52,217
Yeah, well, since you're 
dating her daughter...

806
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:54,887
No, is she Jung Won's daughter now?

807
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:56,787
Anyway...

808
00:43:56,787 --> 00:43:59,117
since you're dating Bit Chae Woon,

809
00:43:59,117 --> 00:44:02,537
you should look after 
Ms. Lee Soon Jung.

810
00:44:02,537 --> 00:44:04,827
Okay. I should do that.

811
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:07,707
Geez, that chairwoman granny.

812
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:10,847
What about her?

813
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:13,957
Your hunch is correct.

814
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:17,937
Chairwoman granny seems to
 be bothering Chae Woon's mother.

815
00:44:17,937 --> 00:44:19,297
How?

816
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:20,857
I don't know the details.

817
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,627
Chae Woon doesn't seem 
to know, either.

818
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:23,987
I see...

819
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:30,607
Soon Jung can't be harsh.

820
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,367
But Dad...

821
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:35,647
You said you knew 
Chae Woon's mom before, right?

822
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:38,347
How do you know her? 
Because she's Mom's friend?

823
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:40,407
Yeah.

824
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:44,927
But I don't think she's that 
close of a friend to Mom.

825
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,567
They seem too different.

826
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:51,637
Well, we all lived in
 the same neighborhood.

827
00:44:51,637 --> 00:44:53,187
All of us.

828
00:44:53,187 --> 00:44:55,387
I see.

829
00:44:55,387 --> 00:44:58,787
By chance, is she your first love?

830
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,227
What? Nonsense.

831
00:45:03,227 --> 00:45:05,197
- She is.
- No, she's not!

832
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:07,137
- She is!
- I said, no!

833
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,507
- Your ears are turning red.
- Go!

834
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:10,887
Geez.

835
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:13,187
Oh, my.

836
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:16,947
Wait, if Chae Woon's mom
 is Dad's first love...

837
00:45:18,227 --> 00:45:20,627
It's complicated.

838
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:25,877
 Geez, if so... 

839
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:29,317
 Help me out until you leave. 

840
00:45:29,317 --> 00:45:30,907
 Please? 

841
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:38,187
 Director Lee, did you think about it? 

842
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:39,647
 My offer? 

843
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:41,177
Does he know what time it is?

844
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:44,447
 I told you I was leaving. 

845
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,967
 - Hello? 
- Why are you calling?

846
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:53,327
Just text me.

847
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:55,327
I don't like to text.

848
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,207
Just help me out until you leave.

849
00:45:58,207 --> 00:46:00,407
 I'm so short on help right now. 

850
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:02,127
 Hae Deun, please? 

851
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,057
Just listen.

852
00:46:03,057 --> 00:46:06,097
My shop is pretty unique.

853
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,927
It's a custom styling shop.

854
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:09,867
We show them samples,

855
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,377
and we style for them.

856
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:12,807
 From head to toe. 

857
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:15,087
Even hair? Makeup?

858
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:17,587
Huh? Hair and makeup?

859
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:20,667
That'd be a great option to add.

860
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,617
Whoa, I'm so good at that stuff.

861
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:23,627
Really? See?

862
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:25,897
See? We're totally 
a match made in heaven.

863
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:28,807
Whatever. I can't.

864
00:46:28,807 --> 00:46:31,567
What do you mean you can't?

865
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:34,267
Director Lee, I noticed last time 
that you have quite the fashion sense.

866
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:37,397
If we work together, 
we're totally perfect.

867
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:38,887
Come on, Director Lee.

868
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:40,397
 Director Lee... 

869
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,307
What are you calling me?

870
00:46:42,307 --> 00:46:45,657
 
 I told you I'll make you a director. 

871
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:48,147
Hae Deun? Listen to me.

872
00:46:48,147 --> 00:46:49,897
"Director Lee Hae Deun."

873
00:46:49,897 --> 00:46:51,457
"CEO Jang Joon Ah."

874
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:52,537
"Director Lee."

875
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:55,117
 - "CEO Jang." 
- I'm hanging up, Mr. Makjang.

876
00:46:55,117 --> 00:46:56,457
 Hello? Director Lee... 

877
00:46:56,457 --> 00:46:57,977
Director Lee?

878
00:46:57,977 --> 00:46:59,977
She hung up. She hung up on me.

879
00:46:59,977 --> 00:47:02,107
I'm not finished, but she hung up.

880
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:08,007
Geez, I know she wants 
to work with me.

881
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:10,237
She was so happy
 when she was working.

882
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:14,587
Geez, I think she'd work perfectly with
 me once she accepts my offer.

883
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,807
Why does she keep
 saying she's leaving?

884
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:19,787
Is that true or not?

885
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:22,187
 
I even put a crown on her.

886
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,057
Geez, seriously.

887
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:30,407
Anyway, that Mr. Makjang is so weird.

888
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:36,707
♫  I love you  ♫

889
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,937
♫  I love you  ♫

890
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:44,597
♫  I only trust you  ♫

891
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:48,337
It was fun, though.

892
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:52,047
♫  Even though we may change  ♫

893
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:55,867
♫  In my eyes, to me  ♫

894
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:57,237
 Gosh... 

895
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:00,707
 Hwak Se must be very disappointed. 

896
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:03,497
 But still... 

897
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:06,097
 I lost everything while dating Dr. Song 

898
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:07,827
 and came back to Unni. 

899
00:48:07,827 --> 00:48:11,417
 How can I tell her I'm dating Hwak Se? 

900
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:14,497
 Shouldn't he understand that much? 

901
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:21,797
♫  I love you  ♫

902
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:38,127
This is love...

903
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:43,067
I shouldn't be sad.

904
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:48,517
♫  This is love  ♫

905
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:52,057
♫  I shouldn't be sad  ♫

906
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:55,557
♫  If I am sad...  ♫

907
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:59,687
♫  I'm so petty  ♫

908
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:25,297
What's wrong?

909
00:49:38,077 --> 00:49:42,187
The mood is so weird this morning.

910
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,297
Is something wrong with everyone?

911
00:49:45,297 --> 00:49:47,147
Why isn't anyone talking?

912
00:49:48,437 --> 00:49:51,337
Hwak Se. Hwak Se!

913
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:54,057
- What's wrong?
- Yes?

914
00:49:55,777 --> 00:49:58,817
My throat was scratchy this morning.

915
00:49:58,817 --> 00:50:00,537
I'm so worried.

916
00:50:00,537 --> 00:50:03,087
Why is your throat scratchy again?

917
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:04,447
Gosh.

918
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:06,857
If your throat hurts,

919
00:50:06,857 --> 00:50:09,047
you should see a doctor consistently.

920
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,567
It's not healing because you 
keep going and stopping.

921
00:50:13,587 --> 00:50:16,637
Yeah, Uncle. See a doctor consistently.

922
00:50:17,617 --> 00:50:19,627
Yeah, right. But...

923
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:23,507
I want to, but I'm so busy with work.

924
00:50:24,757 --> 00:50:27,907
What? That's just an excuse.

925
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:32,287
You have to put an effort to heal.

926
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:35,077
Hey, Man Jung.

927
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:37,417
Who are you looking at while talking?

928
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:41,147
Look at Hwak Se and talk
 if you have something to say.

929
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:43,077
What did I do?

930
00:50:43,077 --> 00:50:44,797
Geez, my eyes feel so dry.

931
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:46,927
Geez, what's with this?

932
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:49,267
Hwak Se, pickles.

933
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:51,317
You asked for them last week.

934
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:54,407
- Eat this.
- Oh, this...

935
00:50:54,407 --> 00:50:56,747
It's a pickle.

936
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:58,607
Yes, thank you, Noonim.

937
00:50:59,897 --> 00:51:02,857
Auntie, you got a text.

938
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:04,277
Huh?

939
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:06,257
- A text.
- Yeah, yeah.

940
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:13,187
Aigoo.

941
00:51:13,187 --> 00:51:15,797
It's that time again.

942
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:18,387
Thank you, Mother.

943
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:20,327
Eat more, Na Ro.

944
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:23,407
I ate a lot.

945
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:25,687
Okay, then have some soojunga.

946
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:27,837
I made some yesterday.

947
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:31,177
What is it?

948
00:51:31,177 --> 00:51:33,537
Prison medical volunteer?

949
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:35,097
Thank you, Mother.

950
00:51:35,097 --> 00:51:37,267
I go every year around this time.

951
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:38,337
Right, Auntie.

952
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:41,887
You slept over here last year
 after you went there.

953
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:43,877
I did.

954
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:50,097
Hello.

955
00:51:54,557 --> 00:51:55,927
Why, Auntie?

956
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,667
- Thank you, Mother.
- Sure.

957
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:01,757
Enjoy.

958
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:03,607
Ba Reun, eat a lot.

959
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:05,397
Okay, thank you.

960
00:52:10,117 --> 00:52:11,507
What?

961
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,657
Enjoy.

962
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:25,747
Aunt, what's wrong?

963
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:30,657
I finally remembered.

964
00:52:31,707 --> 00:52:33,367
What?

965
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:36,047
What? Remember what?

966
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:37,707
What's wrong?

967
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:40,207
Geez.

968
00:52:45,977 --> 00:52:49,477
Why did Auntie stare at me like that?

969
00:52:51,197 --> 00:52:53,367
I feel so uneasy.

970
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:03,407
 
 Hwang Na Ro, this is my last text 
to you out of loyalty. 

971
00:53:03,407 --> 00:53:05,307
 I can't work with you anymore. 

972
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,597
 Pil Hong hyungnim says 
he won't leave me alone. 

973
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:09,067
 I'm sorry. 

974
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:11,257
 Make lots of money, Hwang Na Ro. 

975
00:53:11,257 --> 00:53:14,107
Geez, what a disloyal bastard.

976
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:19,347
Geez, what should I do 
about this Park Pil Hong?

977
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:22,037
Park Pil Hong...

978
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:26,557
It's about time he appears in
 front of CEO Kim Jung Won.

979
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:29,757
Where could he be?

980
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:35,917
Where else?

981
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:40,527
He must be where he can 
be close to his daughter.

982
00:53:42,187 --> 00:53:45,747
Since I'm at CEO Kim's company,
 he can't be there.

983
00:53:46,777 --> 00:53:49,437
If that's the case...

984
00:53:55,187 --> 00:53:56,857
So cold.

985
00:53:59,377 --> 00:54:00,797
Boo!

986
00:54:01,807 --> 00:54:03,517
You came.

987
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:06,937
Your hands are frozen.

988
00:54:06,937 --> 00:54:08,597
Did you come out early?

989
00:54:08,597 --> 00:54:09,957
I just got here.

990
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:13,007
You're "berry-berry" cold.

991
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:14,517
You left early.

992
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,297
What? "Berry-berry"?

993
00:54:17,397 --> 00:54:20,097
My mom used to say that 
all the time when I was little.

994
00:54:20,097 --> 00:54:23,027
"Aigoo, my Chae Woon, 
your feet are berry-berry cold.

995
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:24,377
What should we do?"

996
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:28,557
Aigoo, my Chae Woon's
 fingers are "berry-berry" cold.

997
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,607
What do we do?

998
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,547
You should wait inside.

999
00:54:32,547 --> 00:54:36,037
You'll be walking in from the cold. 
How can I stay where it's warm?

1000
00:54:36,037 --> 00:54:37,697
It's freezing.

1001
00:54:37,697 --> 00:54:39,047
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

1002
00:54:39,047 --> 00:54:40,957
So cold.

1003
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,597
Here. Looks good.

1004
00:54:59,987 --> 00:55:02,877
Your father stopped by Samgwang Villa?

1005
00:55:03,907 --> 00:55:07,377
Then my mom must know that
 your father got his memory back.

1006
00:55:07,377 --> 00:55:08,387
Yeah.

1007
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:14,167
But for now, he asked her
 to keep that to herself.

1008
00:55:15,707 --> 00:55:18,507
Then you were right, Koala.

1009
00:55:18,507 --> 00:55:23,607
You thought that your father might want 
to keep Samgwang Villa as his refuge.

1010
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:25,267
That's right.

1011
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:27,527
It's so neat.

1012
00:55:29,157 --> 00:55:32,587
I'm taken aback by Dad being like that.

1013
00:55:32,587 --> 00:55:35,077
I saw him when he stopped 
by Samgwang Villa last time.

1014
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:37,077
He was totally James.

1015
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:42,127
I wonder if this is the case.

1016
00:55:42,127 --> 00:55:43,457
What?

1017
00:55:43,457 --> 00:55:44,887
Boo-ke. 
(means having a second character)

1018
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:46,837
Boo-ke is popular these days.

1019
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:49,747
James is Father's boo-ke.

1020
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:52,507
- Second character?
- Yeah.

1021
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:57,427
 Father might have been 
more like James originally. 

1022
00:55:57,427 --> 00:56:00,787
♫  I can see your heart even
 when you don't speak  ♫

1023
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:04,897
♫  I can tell just by looking at your eyes  ♫

1024
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:07,707
 Please make your selection. 

1025
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:09,317
 Father is actually... 

1026
00:56:09,317 --> 00:56:12,057
 more like James, but... 

1027
00:56:12,057 --> 00:56:13,537
 due to his tough life, 

1028
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,937
 he couldn't help but change. 

1029
00:56:16,937 --> 00:56:18,147
Whoa!

1030
00:56:24,707 --> 00:56:29,167
♫  The heart that spreads 
at the end of my fingertips  ♫

1031
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:34,097
♫  I will handle with care  ♫

1032
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:35,207
Hot!

1033
00:56:35,207 --> 00:56:38,327
♫  You shine down on 
me with comfort  ♫

1034
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:43,517
♫  You're like sunshine to me  ♫

1035
00:56:43,517 --> 00:56:49,187
♫  You welcome me while 
walking a distance  ♫

1036
00:56:49,187 --> 00:56:50,607
I guess...

1037
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:53,417
side dishes are always a problem.

1038
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:57,297
♫  My love  ♫

1039
00:56:58,777 --> 00:57:00,777
I wonder if it's like that.

1040
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:03,807
I still can't believe it.

1041
00:57:03,897 --> 00:57:06,937
I still remember, "Hey, Woo Jae Hee!"

1042
00:57:07,737 --> 00:57:10,407
That's how I think of my dad.

1043
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:11,877
I guess so.

1044
00:57:11,877 --> 00:57:16,377
As for Samgwang Villa people or me, 
we only remember kind James.

1045
00:57:16,377 --> 00:57:19,797
♫  My one and only love  ♫

1046
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:22,337
I'll put my head down for a moment.

1047
00:57:23,347 --> 00:57:25,497
You must be sleepy 
since you left so early.

1048
00:57:25,497 --> 00:57:26,747
No.

1049
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:31,207
You still have time. Sleep.
 I'll wake you up.

1050
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:33,887
What will you do, Koala?

1051
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:37,387
I'll just look at you like this.

1052
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:41,537
- How can I sleep when you're watching me?
- Why not?

1053
00:57:41,537 --> 00:57:44,467
You have to get used to this.

1054
00:57:44,467 --> 00:57:47,897
You should sleep comfortably 
when I'm watching you like this.

1055
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,257
Why?

1056
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:52,317
What do you mean, why? Well...

1057
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:56,307
we'll be together... in the future....

1058
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:07,287
Hurry up and say it.

1059
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:10,717
- What?
- You have something to tell me.

1060
00:58:11,607 --> 00:58:14,387
It says that right here.

1061
00:58:14,387 --> 00:58:16,717
After you sleep a bit, Moong-i.

1062
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:23,247
What is it?

1063
00:58:27,897 --> 00:58:31,537
Tell me. You said to solve 
things together. What is it?

1064
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:35,607
My dad...

1065
00:58:35,607 --> 00:58:39,707
saw Chairwoman visit Samgwang Villa.

1066
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:44,127
Did Chairwoman say 
something to my mom?

1067
00:58:44,127 --> 00:58:46,247
I don't know about that, but...

1068
00:58:46,247 --> 00:58:48,397
I guess the mood was a little strange.

1069
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:54,677
And there's something
 I couldn't tell you.

1070
00:58:54,677 --> 00:58:56,627
What is it?

1071
00:58:56,627 --> 00:58:59,777
You know that anonymous blog
 incident at your work?

1072
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:03,397
Chairwoman told your mom about it.

1073
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:06,147
So your mom asked me about it.

1074
00:59:06,147 --> 00:59:07,387
Well...

1075
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:10,877
I did ease her mind for now.

1076
00:59:10,877 --> 00:59:13,787
But I didn't know Chairwoman
 would go to her again.

1077
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:18,677
I think I should go see 
Chairwoman right now.

1078
00:59:18,677 --> 00:59:20,497
What is it exactly that

1079
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:23,487
she keeps threatening my mom,
 trying to frame her?

1080
00:59:24,587 --> 00:59:27,117
I think I should get to the bottom of it.

1081
00:59:27,117 --> 00:59:28,587
Moong-i.

1082
00:59:29,687 --> 00:59:31,567
I've held back a lot.

1083
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:36,877
Then, let's go together.

1084
00:59:51,597 --> 00:59:53,567
I'll stay here.

1085
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:05,317
I can't believe you barged in 
so early in the morning.

1086
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:07,467
I was afraid that...

1087
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:11,917
you'll make a scene at 
the lobby, so I let you in.

1088
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:14,277
What is this about?

1089
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,647
Why did you visit my mom again?

1090
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:17,847
What?

1091
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:23,347
Did your mom tattletale already?

1092
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:26,447
What exactly happened that 
you keep threatening my mom?

1093
01:00:27,537 --> 01:00:29,577
What's the story behind it that

1094
01:00:29,577 --> 01:00:34,727
- you keep wanting to frame her?
- Frame? Frame her for what?

1095
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:37,217
How she came to
 raise me back then.

1096
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,577
There's a story there.

1097
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:42,087
But you make it seem as though

1098
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:44,307
my mom didn't look for the CEO.

1099
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,487
You keep wanting to frame her 
as if she really did steal me.

1100
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,707
You keep saying, "my mom, my mom!"

1101
01:00:49,707 --> 01:00:53,007
I did it for my daughter. 
For my daughter!

1102
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:58,127
Just as you'd do anything for 
your mom Lee Soon Jung,

1103
01:00:58,127 --> 01:00:59,877
I did that for my daughter.

1104
01:00:59,877 --> 01:01:02,687
Did I set my mind to it 
from the get-go and...

1105
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:09,907
My gosh.

1106
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:13,357
Aigoo!

1107
01:01:13,357 --> 01:01:16,107
My Jung Won is the pathetic one here.

1108
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:18,677
You only care about 
your mom who raised you,

1109
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:20,187
and you're so antsy to help her.

1110
01:01:20,187 --> 01:01:22,197
Yet she holds you close 
because you're her daughter.

1111
01:01:28,807 --> 01:01:29,737
Geez.

1112
01:01:29,737 --> 01:01:31,557
I was right, after all.

1113
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:35,897
There is something there, 
Chairwoman. Right?

1114
01:01:35,897 --> 01:01:37,367
Get out.

1115
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:38,837
Get out.

1116
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:41,317
Get out right now.

1117
01:01:41,317 --> 01:01:42,517
Get out.

1118
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:45,717
There's definitely something there.

1119
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:49,647
Seeing how Chairwoman misspoke...

1120
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:52,307
your mom did go
 through some injustice.

1121
01:01:54,107 --> 01:01:56,637
I think I need to get to 
the bottom of this.

1122
01:01:56,637 --> 01:01:58,707
I can't hold out any longer.

1123
01:01:58,707 --> 01:02:00,027
You should.

1124
01:02:00,027 --> 01:02:03,437
But first, you should 
convince your mother.

1125
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:06,227
I'll meet her later.

1126
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:07,757
I'll convince her.

1127
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:13,347
Since I've come this far,
 I'll stop by your site.

1128
01:02:13,347 --> 01:02:16,017
You said I need to look at your tiles.

1129
01:02:16,017 --> 01:02:18,177
Do you have the time?

1130
01:02:18,177 --> 01:02:21,087
I have to make rounds to 
all the stores today.

1131
01:02:21,087 --> 01:02:22,767
I can make time before that.

1132
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:26,307
Then I'd be so happy.

1133
01:02:30,257 --> 01:02:32,937
We finished this yesterday. 
It turned out nicely, huh?

1134
01:02:32,937 --> 01:02:34,537
Coffee smell.

1135
01:02:35,307 --> 01:02:36,807
Mr. Lee.

1136
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,647
Good morning, Mr. Woo.

1137
01:02:38,647 --> 01:02:40,777
You're here early.

1138
01:02:40,777 --> 01:02:44,087
Have you met Mr. Lee last time?

1139
01:02:44,087 --> 01:02:46,177
From afar.

1140
01:02:46,177 --> 01:02:47,647
Nice to meet you, Mr. Woo.

1141
01:02:47,647 --> 01:02:49,687
 Mr. Huh from Bulgwangdong
 referred you to us, right? 

1142
01:02:49,687 --> 01:02:51,977
 Yes, I'm Lee Dong Chool. 

1143
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:55,437
It's my girlfriend.

1144
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:58,317
The person on the phone
 yesterday. This is Mr. Lee.

1145
01:02:58,317 --> 01:02:59,737
Hello.

1146
01:02:59,737 --> 01:03:00,917
Hello.

1147
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:04,157
Your both Lees.

1148
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:05,477
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

1149
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:07,347
This is Mr. Lee Dong Chool.

1150
01:03:07,347 --> 01:03:08,807
That's true.

1151
01:03:08,807 --> 01:03:10,217
Nice to meet you.

1152
01:03:10,217 --> 01:03:11,777
Good to meet you.

1153
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:15,217
I heard you make great coffee.

1154
01:03:15,217 --> 01:03:17,287
I was preparing anyway.

1155
01:03:17,287 --> 01:03:18,697
I'll make you a good one.

1156
01:03:18,697 --> 01:03:20,167
Thank you.

1157
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:25,557
I tore down the closure over there.

1158
01:03:25,557 --> 01:03:28,257
- But it keep getting cracked, so if it leaks...
 - Seo Yeon... 

1159
01:03:33,427 --> 01:03:35,637
The tiles for you to look 
at are over there.

1160
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:38,967
Mr. Lee, was there a delivery
 for me yesterday?

1161
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:40,537
I put it over there.

1162
01:03:40,537 --> 01:03:42,527
Thank you. Give me a minute.

1163
01:03:53,537 --> 01:03:55,227
I made it mild.

1164
01:03:55,227 --> 01:03:56,527
Thank you.

1165
01:03:57,607 --> 01:03:59,807
You have to enjoy the smell first.

1166
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:01,197
Like this.

1167
01:04:01,197 --> 01:04:03,057
Is that right?

1168
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:07,647
So nice.

1169
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:08,647
Right?

1170
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:10,767
You have to savor the smell

1171
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:13,507
for your body to say, 
"Oh, my owner will drink the coffee"

1172
01:04:13,507 --> 01:04:15,247
and waits for it.

1173
01:04:15,247 --> 01:04:18,827
You have to prepare your heart
 to welcome your guest as well.

1174
01:04:18,827 --> 01:04:20,457
You're right.

1175
01:04:25,897 --> 01:04:27,287
It's so good.

1176
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:28,827
It's better than the coffee from a cafe.

1177
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:29,917
Really?

1178
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:32,117
Thank you. Come by for
 some more often.

1179
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:33,667
I will.

1180
01:04:35,317 --> 01:04:37,457
Nice.

1181
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,407
 

1182
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:47,777
Should I show this to 
Moong-i or not?

1183
01:04:54,477 --> 01:04:55,877
Moong-i.

1184
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,487
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1185
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:09,337
I asked my friend Min Chul,

1186
01:05:09,337 --> 01:05:11,187
and he sent me a picture.

1187
01:05:12,957 --> 01:05:14,747
Park Pil Hong.

1188
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,147
Really?

1189
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,927
It's personal information,

1190
01:05:56,927 --> 01:05:58,847
so he couldn't send me the digital file.

1191
01:05:58,847 --> 01:06:00,597
He sent a copy.

1192
01:06:02,147 --> 01:06:05,627
 This is my father? 

1193
01:06:08,207 --> 01:06:10,597
How did you get this?

1194
01:06:15,647 --> 01:06:18,827
 I can't tell her that he was in prison. 

1195
01:06:18,827 --> 01:06:21,437
I guess Min Chul was able
 to find it somehow.

1196
01:06:22,907 --> 01:06:25,937
 He's not telling her that I was in prison. 

1197
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:28,507
Let me take a photo of this.

1198
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:42,747
Mr. Woo, have some coffee.

1199
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:44,037
Thank you.

1200
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:46,637
- Mr. Lee, enjoy your coffee.
- Ah, okay.

1201
01:06:48,397 --> 01:06:50,387
What are you staring at?

1202
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:55,057
Excuse us...

1203
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:57,097
Excuse me.

1204
01:06:58,107 --> 01:06:59,517
Someone...

1205
01:07:02,007 --> 01:07:05,007
I've been missing for a long time.

1206
01:07:06,617 --> 01:07:08,407
Oh, I see.

1207
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:12,487
Excuse me.

1208
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,357
Hwang Na Ro.

1209
01:07:15,357 --> 01:07:16,987
Hwang Na Ro.

1210
01:07:16,987 --> 01:07:19,337
Good morning, Bit Chae Woon.

1211
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:20,947
What are you doing here?

1212
01:07:20,947 --> 01:07:22,457
Here?

1213
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:27,627
To find someone.

1214
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,197
Who?

1215
01:07:56,657 --> 01:08:02,077
♫  Did you forget? 
Did you forget about me?  ♫

1216
01:08:02,077 --> 01:08:07,517
♫  Did you forget all those memories  ♫

1217
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:13,747
♫  My heart is opening arms to you  ♫

1218
01:08:13,747 --> 01:08:17,227
♫  I'm barely going through today  ♫

1219
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:19,047
 

1220
01:08:19,047 --> 01:08:21,717
 Did you get to know 
Park Pil Hong in prison? 

1221
01:08:21,717 --> 01:08:23,557
 You know my past. 

1222
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:26,077
 - What will you do now?
- What do you think? 

1223
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:30,947
 You must have something
 exciting coming up. 

1224
01:08:30,947 --> 01:08:33,337
 I'm seeing my old love
 first time in a long time. 

1225
01:08:33,337 --> 01:08:34,187
 Jung Won? 

1226
01:08:34,187 --> 01:08:36,967
 I'd like you to acknowledge me
 as Seo Yeon's father. 

1227
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:40,737
 - You want money?
- I'm not the old Park Pil Hong, Jung Won. 

1228
01:08:40,737 --> 01:08:42,037
 Hello, Noonim. 

1229
01:08:42,037 --> 01:08:43,917
 Oh, my, Professor. 

1230
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:46,057
 When do you get off work today? 

1231
01:08:46,057 --> 01:08:48,097
 If you're okay, would you like
 to have dinner with me? 

1232
01:08:48,097 --> 01:08:51,457
 - You came all this way.
- Ms. Jung Min Jae. 

1233
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:55,817
 Let's go to Chairwoman today and 
reveal the injustice you had to endure. 

1234
01:08:55,817 --> 01:08:57,787
 You can't keep taking it like this, Mom. 

1235
01:08:57,807 --> 01:08:59,747
 - Soon Jung...
- Hello, Chairwoman. 

1236
01:08:59,747 --> 01:09:03,107
♫  My heart is filled with tears  ♫
