1
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,750
 

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,700
Oh, no. My goodness. Seo Yeon.

3
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, no...

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,200
Oh, no...

5
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,600
My gosh...

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,700
Oh, no...

7
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,570
My goodness.

8
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,670
Seo Yeon.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,600
 

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,970
 

11
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,770
 

12
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,950
 

13
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,800
Okay.

14
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,170
Oh, my!

15
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,320
Oh, no!

16
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,400
Aigoo.

17
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,910
 

18
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,210
Aigoo, my goodness.

19
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,190
Aigoo.

20
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,230
She must've pulled
 an all-nighter again.

21
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,760
Gosh.

22
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,500
My gosh.

23
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,080
Aigoo...

24
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
My gosh!

25
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,540
Yeobudong by 7 a.m., 
Samseongdong by 10 a.m.

26
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,190
At 11 a.m...

27
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,700
Why are there so many stops?

28
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,000
 

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,760
 

30
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Escape.

31
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,120
For sure.

32
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,060
All right...

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,000
Smells nice.

34
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
Chae Woon will faint.

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Mom, I'm leaving!

36
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,360
Oh, you have to eat breakfast.

37
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,650
- I have to go now.
- No! Chae Woon!

38
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,290
 Hey, Bit Chae Woon! 

39
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,570
I'm sorry, Mom! Love you!

40
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,560
Ms. Lee.

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
- Going to work already?
- Good morning, Uncle.

42
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,090
Did you have lots of customers?

43
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,900
I worked three gigs like 
a medley all night long.

44
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,370
- We'll talk details tonight.
- Okay.

45
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,090
Oh, sorry.

46
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
- Uncle!
- Chae Woon!

47
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,900
Wait a minute.

48
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,290
Take a bite before you go. 
It's beef radish soup.

49
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,140
It's your favorite.

50
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,600
- It's a killer.
- Right?

51
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,700
Wait, the meat.

52
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,320
Noonim, it's hot!

53
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,460
No, no, it's okay.

54
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,100
My hand is fine.

55
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm off!

56
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,960
Wait, this, too.

57
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,730
Hot, hot!

58
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,960
Wait a minute. This, too.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You have to blow this into the air.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,790
It's an important day for you.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,490
- Okay.
- Wow, your lucky petal.

62
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,900
This is valuable.

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,920
Please let my Chae Woon
 make it today.

64
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,820
I'm really late. I'm going.

65
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,070
Good luck today. 
Fighting, my daughter!

66
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,710
You know what today is, right?

67
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,760
Come home early tonight!

68
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,100
Good luck with what, Noonim?

69
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,990
Today is the deadline 
for the final submission.

70
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,310
Oh, that design competition?

71
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,600
She gets to go to Paris
 if she wins?

72
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,640
Gosh, New York.

73
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,590
Not Paris.

74
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,890
New York! Not Paris.

75
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,440
♫  You can tell me why  ♫

76
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,750
♫  Oh, no, please don't tell me why  ♫

77
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,160
♫  I couldn't forget you  ♫

78
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:25,510
♫  In the warmth of your glance  ♫

79
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,890
♫  Those cruel eyes  ♫

80
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,370
♫  Your warm hands  ♫

81
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,580
Room 304.

82
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,370
Yes?

83
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,400
When will you pay for your room?

84
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,720
You're behind since last week.

85
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,150
Have I not paid you yet?

86
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,070
This won't work if you'll be this way.

87
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,040
I gave you a 20% discount 
for a long-term stay.

88
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,850
I'm sorry. I'll pay you tonight.

89
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,900
My apologies.

90
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,860
How is it living in a motel?

91
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,820
Totally trying to get used to it.

92
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,900
Wow, you're so...

93
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,220
You put your house 
into your business

94
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,780
- and you're living in a motel?
- Hey.

95
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,230
Our company is upward bound.

96
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,500
I should invest in it boldly.

97
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,350
When it's high time, I'll go for it.

98
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,380
Geez, go for it, man.

99
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,160
Good for you, man.

100
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,190
With that in mind,
 let's work today as well.

101
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,690
- Okay!
- "Fighting" on the count of three.

102
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,360
 One, two, three! 

103
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Geez, that guy...

104
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,250
Wait for me.

105
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,550
We have to finish all that 
over there today, huh?

106
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,700
Sir!

107
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,400
You can't tear this down. 
It's dangerous.

108
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,140
I'm following the blueprint. 
What's wrong?

109
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,340
What in the world...

110
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,870
Where is the blueprint?

111
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,680
- Where is it?
- What's going on?

112
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,600
Hello.

113
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,550
I'm Lee, in charge of 
the interior decoration.

114
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,030
He's trying to tear this down.

115
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,990
I was part of the plumbing job
 here three years ago.

116
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,330
Hyungnim, let's rush.

117
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,310
We have to finish this today.

118
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,290
We took out the water pipes 
from the second floor then

119
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,050
and buried along this wall and

120
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,890
connected them down to the drain.

121
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,390
No.

122
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,110
- Please wait.
- Look.

123
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,970
- Are you the interior designer?
- Yes.

124
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,720
- If you tear this down...
- Then...

125
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,950
Please wrap up the decoration 
work on the second floor.

126
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,840
What a sloppy mess.

127
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,730
Come on!

128
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,380
Look here.

129
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,500
If you tear that down,

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,280
you'll flood this area.

131
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,740
The pipes are all connected 
from the second floor

132
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,040
to the drains by the entrance.

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,850
- Mr. Yu!
- Huh?

134
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,150
Bring me the blueprint.

135
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,740
It's in your pocket.

136
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,270
Okay!

137
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,420
From what I'm hearing,

138
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,940
it sounds like you've picked up 
a few things in the field.

139
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,220
Take a look.

140
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,970
This isn't right.

141
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,740
- What the heck? This isn't it.
- Ms. Lee.

142
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,570
This has been revised four times.

143
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,830
This is the latest version. Here.

144
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,560
Do you see that?

145
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
I see.

146
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,730
Right.

147
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,050
This is wrong.

148
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,360
Look at this.

149
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,130
We're in this area right here.

150
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,690
But it's not indicated in the blueprint.

151
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,100
This blueprint is off.

152
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,620
Well, did you study architecture?

153
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,040
Are you my hoobae?

154
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,300
You're my hoobae, and you're 
trying to impress me...

155
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,120
I didn't attend university, and

156
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,540
I'm telling you based 
on my experience.

157
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,000
I've worked in this field
 for almost ten years.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,640
Based on my experience...

159
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,900
Ms. Lee, I'm very angry 
with your company.

160
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,460
The owner of this place 
called various people

161
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,620
to collaborate and that upset me, 
but I'm holding it in.

162
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,080
But seeing how the wall finish is...

163
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm just so furious.

164
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,270
The previous person did that.

165
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,170
- I joined as of yesterday. 
- In any case...

166
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,230
let's focus on our own tasks.

167
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,620
Don't throw a hissy fit and stick 
your nose in my business.

168
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,530
A hissy fit?

169
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,910
I think you'll be throwing a hissy fit.

170
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,390
You strictly go by the book 
and are so frustrating.

171
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,670
What did you say?

172
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,930
I clearly warned you.

173
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,320
I don't care if you regret this later.

174
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,700
Excuse me.

175
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,770
What's with her? Hey, you!

176
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,360
What the heck was that?

177
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,050
Mr. Woo, we have to go.

178
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,400
Okay.

179
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Tear this part down 
and put it with this.

180
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
Connect this and that area.

181
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,680
I think so, too.

182
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,200
What? What?

183
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,510
Hey, come down. What are
 you doing right now?

184
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,390
Yes, give me a moment.

185
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,900
Excuse me.

186
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,020
Please turn off the water 
valves upstairs.

187
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,640
Okay, got it, Ms. Lee.

188
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,970
Geez, come on. Come down.

189
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,260
Come down!

190
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,600
Geez!

191
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,940
Mr. Woo.

192
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,550
I think she's right.

193
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,180
Hey, what's going on here?

194
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,750
The building owner said he 
changed all the pipes recently.

195
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,910
He lied.

196
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,280
Geez, he's trying to 
save some money.

197
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,900
Okay.

198
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,420
Done.

199
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,600
I happened to have some sockets. 
But this is a quick fix.

200
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,540
You have to change
 the pipe quickly.

201
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,320
Good thing we did this 
before tearing down the wall.

202
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,680
Did you hear that?

203
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,930
- Let's change them. 
- Okay.

204
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,100
Mr. Woo.

205
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,000
I told you I've been 
around in this field.

206
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,330
Why can't he believe me?
 So much mistrust.

207
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Mr. Woo!

208
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,370
Mr. Woo!

209
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,620
Hey, hey...

210
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,350
Hey! Wake up!

211
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,630
- Wake up! 
- Hyung!

212
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,950
Geez!

213
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,380
Wake up!

214
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,490
 I know I'm pretty. 

215
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,230
 Stop staring. 

216
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,820
 Gosh, so tiring. 

217
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,250
The men's room is over there.

218
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,710
You're pretty.

219
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,200
Thanks.

220
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,040
I pick you today.

221
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,490
That's too bad. I'm not
 picking you today.

222
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,480
I think you'll pick me once 
you know who I am.

223
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,150
Come. I'll tell you.

224
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,960
Let go of me!

225
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,950
Oh-ho, you're strong.

226
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,360
So cool.

227
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,700
- How much do you want?
- What?

228
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,000
How much does it 
take to date you?

229
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,400
You came here for money, 
didn't you?

230
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Hey, I didn't come here 
for the money.

231
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,160
I came because my friend's
 blind date fell through.

232
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,690
Give me a break.

233
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,620
I know girls like you very well.

234
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,560
Just because of your pretty face,

235
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,980
you try to snag
 a rich guy somehow.

236
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,360
I'll give you.

237
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,700
I'll give you money.

238
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,980
Gosh, what nonsense is this?

239
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,800
Why not? Huh?

240
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,400
This is me.

241
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,400
How dare you refuse me?

242
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,630
I refuse you because 
you're this way.

243
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,450
So what if you have
 tons of money?

244
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,820
Totally unattractive,

245
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,940
sucky manners, and no self-esteem.

246
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,020
Take your pick elsewhere.

247
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,210
Darn it.

248
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,890
Gosh, I said, don't!

249
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,500
Get her!

250
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,610
You'd better stop.

251
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,230
S***.

252
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,690
Look over there!

253
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,100
Geez.

254
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,610
Get her!

255
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,200
Gosh!

256
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,010
Let go!

257
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,600
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon!

258
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,780
Who the hell are you?

259
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,160
You want to know?

260
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,320
I'm her husband.

261
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,830
- Hey!
- You were married?

262
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,200
Run.

263
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,470
- A gold digger!
- Get her!

264
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,230
You're dead.

265
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,300
What do we do now?

266
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,080
You trust me, right?

267
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,310
- No. 
- Darn it, just trust me.

268
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,730
Geez. Hey!

269
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,000
My gosh.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,370
Did it dry?

271
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,790
Whatever!

272
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,970
What in the world? 
This is expensive.

273
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,850
I rescued you out of the den of evil.

274
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,390
How ungrateful of you!

275
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,780
Hey.

276
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,390
How did you know that I was here?

277
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,670
There's nothing I don't
 know about you.

278
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,770
Don't you know you're playing
 in the palm of my hands?

279
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,920
- How did you know?
- I saw it on SNS.

280
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,870
You and your friends.

281
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,060
You guys talked about some party 
here with rich people for days.

282
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,010
I've been checking up on everything 
you were saying with your friends.

283
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,210
I've been nervous ever since!

284
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,180
So what? That's because...

285
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,380
Ji Min said her blind 
date fell through,

286
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,660
so I had no choice 
but to come out.

287
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,580
You come to a place
 like this just for that?

288
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,060
Do you meet anyone who's rich?

289
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,840
Hey, who cares if I meet them?

290
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,160
I don't have to date them.

291
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,700
You think you can control that?

292
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,010
That guy...

293
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,260
He's number one on the 
blacklist in your field.

294
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,120
- Really? 
- "Really..."

295
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,680
Geez.

296
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,090
What a Cinderella virus carrier.

297
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,860
What do I do with you?

298
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,340
I don't have the Cinderella virus.

299
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,060
Then what is it?

300
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,170
Just learning the attitude.

301
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,040
What attitude?

302
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,560
It's none of your business.

303
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,090
Gosh...

304
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,150
If you were my sister, I'd just...

305
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,610
I'd just...

306
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,970
You're wrinkling my pretty face.

307
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,440
Hey! I have to get to work.

308
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,240
I took a half-day off.
 Take this home.

309
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,860
She's going to fall.

310
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,070
Hey, you'll fall!

311
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,540
 

312
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,580
I'm sorry. There were too many 
patients at the hospital...

313
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,860
I had to wait...

314
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,580
Yeah, right. The showcase is today.

315
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,580
♫  I'll approach you and 
speak to you shyly  ♫

316
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,760
♫  The door to the future that 
only you can make  ♫

317
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,150
♫  I'll memorize the spell 
to open your heart  ♫

318
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,020
♫  Mysterious  ♫

319
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,840
♫  Look at me, hold my hand  ♫

320
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,180
♫  I'll give you my heart that
 I've been saving for someone  ♫

321
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,480
♫  I'll approach you and embrace you  ♫

322
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,530
♫  Feel the dance  ♫

323
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,900
♫  You and I together  ♫

324
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,940
♫  Shout as loud as you can  ♫

325
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,080
♫  Don't be afraid of losing me  ♫

326
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,150
♫  I've come to an unknown place  ♫

327
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,480
♫  I only see his world  ♫

328
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,770
♫  My heart thumps 
when I think of you  ♫

329
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,100
♫  My heart is trembling  ♫

330
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,110
♫  Every moment of meeting you  ♫

331
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,930
♫  Pretty space where 
you can feel me  ♫

332
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,910
Hae Deun, what are
 you doing here?

333
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,940
You came in late 
taking the morning off.

334
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm sorry. I'll get to work.

335
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,650
Go now.

336
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,250
Please take a look.

337
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,450
Thank you.

338
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,300
Ma'am, take a look at this.

339
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,700
Thanks.

340
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,330
Ma'am, we have some cauliflower

341
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,130
that's sold only on
 the first floor of our mall.

342
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,580
Please take a look.

343
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,420
Oh, my.

344
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,030
You look so cute.

345
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,120
Give me some of this.

346
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,620
I'll help you.

347
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,490
- One more, please.
- Okay.

348
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,420
- My daughter likes it.
- Sure.

349
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,680
Cauliflower?

350
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,020
Ma'am.

351
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,690
Are you done shopping already?

352
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,800
Since I come here every day, 
there's nothing to see.

353
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,400
It's my daughter's birthday today.

354
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,060
The quality is good here for these.

355
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,340
I'm sorry. These are 
my personal items.

356
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,370
It's okay.

357
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,240
You should feed her 
good things on her birthday.

358
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,130
Buy everything you want. 
It's my treat.

359
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,720
No, ma'am.

360
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,330
I bought everything 
I needed yesterday.

361
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,520
Here you are.

362
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,150
Please take a look
 over here, ma'am.

363
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,210
Sweet potatoes.

364
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,210
They're organic and very delicious.

365
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,080
- Ahjumma!
- Yes.

366
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,350
She's my boss.

367
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,710
I work for her.

368
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,160
- Give them to me.
- Okay.

369
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,080
Anyway, I shouldn't go
 around with you.

370
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,860
Everyone always thinks
 you're the madam.

371
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,820
Gosh, no, ma'am.

372
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,980
They think you and I are friends.

373
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,710
Because you look so
 young and beautiful.

374
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,080
If they find out you're 
much older than me,

375
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,670
they'll all faint.

376
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,670
I'm going to the ladies' room.

377
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,790
Okay.

378
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,950
See you, ma'am.

379
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,170
 

380
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,910
My son.

381
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,840
 Where are you? At school? 

382
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,230
Huh?

383
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,860
Yeah.

384
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,880
It's my break.

385
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,420
I was wondering what kind of gift
 (sounds like fish) I should get you.
 

386
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,090
Do you need anything, Mom?

387
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,420
 Fish? 
(Short for birthday gift) 

388
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,170
I bought some fish already.

389
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,800
Your favorite cutlassfish.

390
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,810
Not that kind of fish.

391
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,230
Your birthday gift.

392
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,960
Oh, gosh.

393
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
It's okay.

394
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,300
What birthday gift?

395
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,450
My son...

396
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,330
 got into the elite Seohan University. 

397
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,870
 That's worth ten years of gifts. 

398
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,320
You can't do no wrong, as you say.

399
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,390
 Hello? 

400
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,030
 Ra Hoon. 

401
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,010
Yeah, Mom, my class is
 starting. I have to go.

402
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,350
Oh, okay.

403
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,080
- I'm working, too.
- Okay.

404
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,050
- Did you see?
- I did. So funny.

405
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,820
- The facial expression.
- It was so funny.

406
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,190
 Please... 

407
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,190
It'd be so nice if I'm a student here.

408
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,020
 

409
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,570
My goodness...

410
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,400
I wonder if Chae Woon 
submitted her work okay.

411
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,970
 

412
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,300
Aigoo. No, no.

413
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,810
She must be busy. 
Let's call her later.

414
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,670
 

415
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,650
Gosh...

416
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,300
I have 30 minutes left 
until the deadline.

417
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Gosh, Bit Chae Woon...

418
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,340
Why did I meddle?

419
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,980
Wait.

420
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
 I didn't see you. 

421
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,780
Geez.

422
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,890
No, no...

423
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,220
No...

424
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,430
I'm sorry, Director.

425
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,160
Someone jumped in front of us.

426
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,800
Just a moment.

427
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,100
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

428
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,080
- I'll take you to the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

429
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,100
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,600
Bit Chae Woon?

431
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
 It's Bit Chae Woon. 

432
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,350
I'll take care of this, Director.

433
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,510
Okay.

434
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,610
Yes, CEO.

435
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,450
Director Jang, did you leave?

436
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,730
Just now.

437
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,350
I'm sorry.

438
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,340
My meeting with Sejin 
ended a bit late.

439
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,410
 You can't be late. 
The kids will be waiting. 

440
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,180
- I just got here.
- CEO!

441
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,200
 Ahjumma! 

442
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,490
How have you been?

443
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,080
Gosh, Hae Rin grew so much.

444
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,770
 

445
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,950
 

446
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,470
Why?

447
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,730
Come on!

448
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Wait a minute!

449
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,610
Excuse me.

450
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,730
Where are you going?

451
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,040
To submit this.

452
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,780
- It's over.
- Wait...

453
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,590
- You can't go in.
- Why not?

454
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,190
Give me a moment!

455
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,470
Excuse me...

456
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,550
Wait.

457
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,220
Just a moment!

458
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
My portfolio.

459
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,350
For the final round.

460
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,520
So, did you submit it?

461
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,080
Yeah, I just turned it in.

462
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,400
Gosh, I almost missed it.

463
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,300
You should've rushed it.

464
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,880
I wanted to, but...

465
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,930
I had so much going on today.

466
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,750
Too many things were going wrong.

467
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,270
I bumped into an annoying guy.

468
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,730
 - Hey, hey, hey!
- Hyung! 

469
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,650
He looked like a crushed koala.

470
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,600
Really?

471
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,940
Look at the sky and spit.

472
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,830
 Hurry. 

473
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,640
Darn it.

474
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,780
 Spit, take that! 

475
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,260
Good job.

476
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,040
Now, you'll only have good luck.

477
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,440
They say if the mountain is deep,

478
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,460
the valley is tall.

479
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,840
It's the opposite.

480
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,680
If the mountain is high, 
the valley is deep.

481
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,850
Oh.

482
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,290
Yeah, right, right.

483
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,150
Aigoo, tomato or to-mah-to.

484
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,850
To-mah-to or tomato.

485
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,160
Hurry home. We'll have 
our birthday party.

486
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,310
I'm off work, too. I just got home.

487
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,450
Well, I have to stop by another site.

488
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,150
Okay, make me lots 
of good food, Mom.

489
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,390
Yeah.

490
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,810
 

491
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,050
Get the grand prize.

492
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,300
I must.

493
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,410
Please...

494
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,610
 Fresh vegetables are here. 

495
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,300
 We also have fresh fruits. 

496
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,280
Oh, my.

497
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,350
- Unni!
- Oh, my gosh!

498
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,890
My goodness, Man Jung!

499
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,620
- Unni!
- The doctor!

500
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,560
The doctor!

501
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,360
What brings you here? 
You're busy.

502
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,260
How about the
 Jeju Island hospital?

503
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,550
- I...
- Yeah?

504
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,080
I had a conference in Seoul, 
so I stopped by.

505
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,170
Gosh...

506
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,290
Hey, girl.

507
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,960
You came because it's 
my birthday, huh?

508
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,300
Of course! I came here
 for your birthday.

509
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,270
- You're so thoughtful.
- Unni...

510
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,710
Aigoo, my goodness.

511
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,060
Aigoo.

512
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,400
You miss me more 
since you live far away, huh?

513
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,600
- Right, I miss you so much.
- Aigoo...

514
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,650
- I'm glad you came.
- Unni...

515
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,330
Man Jung, go inside.

516
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,340
Aigoo, all right.

517
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,250
Go inside.

518
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,580
I have to go and buy 
something. I'll be back.

519
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,070
Here.

520
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,550
- Go inside?
- Yeah.

521
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,670
I thought of you this morning 
while making plum juice.

522
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,020
Gosh, and you came. 
I'm glad you came.

523
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,940
- Go inside.
- Go now.

524
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,310
No, go inside.

525
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,190
- Go inside.
- Go on.

526
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,560
Hurry up and go inside.

527
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,790
Go inside and... 
Aigoo, so heavy.

528
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,950
Why do you have so much stuff?

529
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,030
Go inside, drink some 
juice, and rest.

530
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,040
I'll be right back.

531
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,000
Gosh...

532
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,640
Unni.

533
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,190
Where are you going?

534
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,470
- Go in.
- Okay.

535
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,310
Oh, my God! My God...

536
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,180
Gosh!

537
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,050
He startled me.

538
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,930
Gosh...

539
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,120
Geez, that Kim Hwak Se.

540
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,980
He hasn't moved out.

541
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,350
Why isn't he moving out?

542
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,460
♫  Did you see? Did you see? 
Did you see?  ♫

543
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,660
♫  Did you see me 
with another woman?  ♫

544
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,360
♫  Trust this man  ♫

545
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,650
♫  You always doubt me  ♫

546
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,030
♫  You always get miffed at me  ♫

547
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:46,540
♫  Why is it so difficult?  ♫

548
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,050
♫  Why are you complaining now?  ♫

549
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,150
Excuse me? How old?

550
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,460
129 years old.

551
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,900
I'm 56. My oldest daughter is 27,

552
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,880
my second daughter is 24,

553
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,700
and my youngest is 22.

554
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,270
We all have the same birthday.

555
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,820
Really? How neat.

556
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,280
Isn't it fascinating?

557
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,380
I think so, too.

558
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
Here you go.

559
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,210
 Catch me if you can! 

560
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,700
Aigoo, so cute.

561
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,300
So cute.

562
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,320
Gosh, they're so pretty.

563
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,900
Right?

564
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,980
The kids are most 
adorable at that age.

565
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,550
I know.

566
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,400
Gosh.

567
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,890
My kids were like that
 at some point.

568
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,910
Chatting away and yelling.

569
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,900
Gosh, when did they 
grow up so fast?

570
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,370
Well, the kids grow up
 fast once they're born.

571
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,830
How many children do you have?

572
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,620
I have three.

573
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,420
Two daughters and a son.

574
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
They're all grown up now.

575
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,100
Two daughters and a son.

576
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,540
Gosh, that's perfect.

577
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,300
You must be so happy.

578
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,980
Yes, I'm happy.

579
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,140
How about you, ahjumma?

580
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,620
Three kids.

581
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,960
You must've struggled 
so much, raising them alone.

582
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,100
Without their father.

583
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,670
Do you know me?

584
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,620
Of course, I do.

585
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,370
You worked in an
 orphanage a long time ago.

586
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,920
Down south.

587
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,830
Don't you know me?

588
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,460
I worked there, too.

589
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,590
Is that so?

590
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,980
But who are you again?

591
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,520
I'm disappointed.

592
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,600
By chance...

593
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,500
- did you work in the kitchen...
- How are your kids?

594
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,600
Yes, they're well.

595
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,560
- But I can't seem to recall...
- I'm glad they're well.

596
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,290
They must've grown up so nicely...

597
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,120
despite the fact that one 
of them was stolen.

598
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,400
Excuse me?

599
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,460
Isn't that right?

600
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,640
I know about your family very well.

601
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,910
Who are you, ahjumma?

602
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,980
What are you saying...

603
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,970
Who are you exactly?

604
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,500
Aren't you Ms. Kim Bok Hui?

605
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,880
From Haenam.

606
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,440
From Happy Orphanage.

607
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,790
No, I'm not.

608
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,010
I never lived there before.

609
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,700
Oh, no. I must be mistaken.

610
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,820
I'm so sorry.

611
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Gosh.

612
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,870
You don't even know anything.

613
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,890
Why do you speak as if 
you know everything?

614
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,220
My gosh.

615
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,780
Where did she go?

616
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Who was that ahjumma?

617
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,300
Gosh...

618
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,900
What a strange woman.

619
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,290
That was so offensive.

620
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,320
No way.

621
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,500
 

622
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,490
 
Wow...

623
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,700
Whoa...

624
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,330
Let's try it.

625
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,870
Kids wait for the day 
you come to visit us.

626
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,720
- Oh, my. Really?
- Yes.

627
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,350
- Is that true?
- Yes.

628
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,730
I want to see you every
 day, ahjumma.

629
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,840
Gosh, thank you!

630
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,570
Gyeol, she's not "ahjumma." 
She's CEO.

631
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,140
No, ma'am.

632
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,400
It's okay. I love it when 
I'm called ahjumma.

633
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,100
Take this!

634
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,100
Watch out!

635
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,600
CEO!

636
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,790
CEO!

637
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,420
 CEO! 

638
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,090
 Hae Rin! 

639
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,670
Did you get hurt, Hae Rin?

640
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,010
Are you all right?

641
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,180
You must've been 
so scared, my baby.

642
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,840
It was scary, huh? It's okay.

643
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,070
It's okay now.

644
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,740
CEO!

645
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,150
Are you okay?

646
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,950
Oh, no, CEO...

647
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,750
I'm okay.

648
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,070
Gosh, my Hae Rin.

649
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,270
You've turned into a snowman.

650
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,870
So pretty!

651
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,230
What have you all been doing

652
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,650
that CEO had to go
 through that?

653
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,130
My apologies, Director.

654
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,620
It happened so suddenly.

655
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,410
If it happened so suddenly,

656
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,160
how could the CEO be
 faster than all of you?

657
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,900
Director Jang, what's going on?

658
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,470
It's nothing, CEO.

659
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,210
Gosh, our Director Jang
 is overreacting again.

660
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,790
My people didn't do 
anything wrong.

661
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,870
CEO.

662
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,280
How did your meeting
 with Sejin go?

663
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,320
It went well.

664
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,920
I'll brief you on our way back.

665
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,010
Go on home. Good job.

666
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,740
You should've changed inside.

667
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,120
It must be uncomfortable.

668
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,450
Why bother?

669
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,160
Kids were so excited that
 I turned into a snowman.

670
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,850
Ms. Kim and Mr. Goo. 
They're all slacking off.

671
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,900
Gosh. So...

672
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,250
were you upset again, 
my daughter?

673
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,430
- Are you my mom now?
- Gosh.

674
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,450
"My people didn't do anything wrong."

675
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,040
You always ostracize me.

676
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,500
Gosh, you're so cute!

677
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,480
Even how you get 
miffed so easily...

678
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,440
reminds me so much 
of Kim Jung Won.

679
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,140
Well, it's because I'm
 Kim Jung Won's daughter.

680
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,500
♫  I guess I'm still young  ♫

681
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,770
♫  I must be  ♫

682
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,300
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫

683
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,970
♫  Why do I miss you 
out of the blue?  ♫

684
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,580
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫

685
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:00,150
♫  Why do I feel sad 
out of the blue?  ♫

686
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,020
♫  On the hill with colors of fall  ♫

687
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,270
♫  I came to pick some wildflowers  ♫
 Mr. Woo will arrive soon.

688
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,770
Let's set the table.

689
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,070
How do I look?

690
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,200
Hello.

691
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,440
When did you clean up 
by the front door?

692
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,180
Today...

693
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,660
I swept around 5 p.m. 
this evening.

694
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,800
This was in front of my front door.

695
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,560
I'm sorry, sir.

696
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,970
How could this be...

697
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,890
You sweep.

698
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,070
We should sweep 
our own house entrance.

699
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,120
Our house is ours to keep up.

700
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,620
My apologies, sir!

701
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,390
I'm sorry!

702
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,850
She should do the work 
she's getting paid for.

703
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,560
How much do you pay her?

704
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,660
She gets enough.

705
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,040
What?

706
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,560
She gets 5% less than
 the market price.

707
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,260
She's very good at the job.

708
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,560
I'm worried she might quit.

709
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,240
Fire her, and you do it.

710
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,500
Honey...

711
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,420
This is my final warning.

712
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,260
If I spot another thing, I'll fire her.

713
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,090
- Aigoo.
- Gosh.

714
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,530
Here.

715
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,740
There's a hole on the heel. 
Sew it up.

716
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,680
How is Jae Hee?

717
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,560
He must be busy.

718
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,790
What a pain in the neck.

719
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,190
 

720
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,360
Jae Hee!

721
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,400
I couldn't answer your call earlier.

722
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,710
Is something the matter?

723
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,380
 I just wanted to hear 
my son's voice. 

724
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,530
Dad must be home already.

725
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,900
You're whispering.

726
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,020
He came home early today.

727
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,590
 What did he pick 
a fight with today? 

728
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,360
It's all the same.

729
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,290
Isn't Seo Ah's father's memorial 
around this time of the year?

730
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,590
It's today. I'll stop by later.

731
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,540
 Yes. 

732
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,500
You should go on a day like this.

733
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Their son is out of the country.

734
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,980
 My underwear! 

735
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,560
Yes.

736
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,120
Hey, hang up. Hang up.

737
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,180
Mom...

738
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,330
Geez.

739
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,930
My forehead...

740
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,160
 

741
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,300
The 23rd.

742
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,160
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon!

743
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,200
It hurts! It hurts! I give up! Give up!

744
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,830
Are you really my sister?

745
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,870
- It really hurts! 
- Are you my brother?

746
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,900
I always get you, but
 you keep provoking me.

747
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,120
Provoke?

748
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,160
I was going to hug you.

749
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,030
My dear sister.

750
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,380
Did you go around like this again?

751
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,220
- Come on!
- What now?

752
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,580
Would a man approach you 
when you look like this?

753
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,970
I don't need a man.

754
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,200
Hey, galbijim.

755
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,890
Plus japchae, beef pancakes.

756
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,910
And fish jeon.

757
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,310
- Go, go, go!
- Let's go!

758
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,330
Let's go!

759
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,000
Gosh, I just love your family.

760
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,350
For everyone in the family to
 have the same birthday?

761
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,660
This is totally newsworthy.

762
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,980
Right?

763
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,900
Gosh. That's what I'm talking about.

764
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,960
The lady of the house 
where I work at said

765
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,190
three siblings who share 
the same birthday were on TV.

766
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,690
- Really?
- Yeah.

767
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,960
Some doctor said on that show

768
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,020
that this is extremely rare.

769
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,020
While walking down the street, 
you get hit by a meteorite.

770
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,570
He says the chances are 
even lower than that.

771
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,610
Oh, I see.

772
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,080
The rock...

773
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,990
No, a meteorite.

774
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,300
- Oh, a meteorite.
- We're home!

775
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,580
- We're home!
- Kids are home!

776
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,810
Kids are home.

777
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,060
You're home.

778
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,730
Auntie!

779
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,790
Ra Hoon!

780
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,840
How have you been, my nephew?

781
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,150
My hoobae from Seohan University.

782
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,900
- All right.
- Chae Woon.

783
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,790
You went through a lot today, huh?

784
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,000
Look at your clothes.

785
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,280
- Hurry up and wash up.
- Okay.

786
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,080
Hey, Bit Chae Woon.

787
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,520
You should greet me 
when you see me.

788
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,470
Can't you see me?

789
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,000
- Hello.
- Hi.

790
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,420
What?

791
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,360
Gosh, I was going to go
 on a diet starting today!

792
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,200
Auntie!

793
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,500
Auntie, I missed you!

794
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,380
Me, too. Me, too.

795
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,980
My Hae Deun.

796
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,500
So adorable.

797
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,940
There's a call. Quiet!

798
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,710
- Ms. Noh in the States.
- Oh, yeah?

799
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,700
Hold it for me.

800
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,630
Hello, ma'am.

801
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,970
How are you?

802
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,530
Gosh.

803
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,620
I can't believe you remember
 our kids' birthday.

804
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,210
Gosh, yes. Thank you.

805
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,360
Yes.

806
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,890
Of course, I remember.

807
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:55,750
You let us manage the villa
 instead of paying rent.

808
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,710
I'm so grateful for just that.

809
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,150
Yes.

810
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,110
We're getting ready to move out.

811
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,710
Yes, ma'am.

812
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,770
Thank you. Goodnight.

813
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,870
Mom.

814
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,580
Unni, do we have to 
move out of here?

815
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,860
Gosh, no...

816
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,110
- When?
- Really?

817
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,390
- Whoa.
- No, no...

818
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,530
- Next spring?
- Yeah.

819
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:25,090
Ms. Noh is coming back 
to Korea for good next fall.

820
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,430
Before then,

821
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:29,780
I guess she'll demolish everything
 and build a new building.

822
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,810
Then we'll have to move out.

823
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,420
- Where should we go?
- Gosh.

824
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,270
I'm sure things will work out.

825
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,600
- Don't worry.
- Mom...

826
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,660
Why are you telling me that now?

827
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,240
How can I tell you...

828
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,000
all that when you're focusing
 on your competition?

829
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,600
Gosh, japchae will get soggy.

830
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,970
Hwak Se, help me out.

831
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:02,900
Yes, Noonim.

832
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,430
Everyone heard, right?

833
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,780
Let's get ready.

834
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,700
Ready for what?

835
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,940
Hey, Chae Woon.

836
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,980
- We're still okay.
- What do you mean...

837
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,090
We have to save up as 
much as we can to move.

838
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,340
Our apartment we're renting out?

839
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,600
Because we have to give
 them the security deposit?

840
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,560
Yeah. Well...

841
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,190
Mom, did you tell the tenants 
that we're moving in?

842
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,920
Yeah. Of course.

843
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,620
That place is so small.

844
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,700
The semi-basement and

845
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,530
the upstairs room
 didn't rent out, right?

846
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,300
Yeah, well, I did list
 them for rent.

847
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,600
A few people stopped by to look,

848
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,590
but no one is interested.

849
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,930
You guys, ask around.

850
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,640
You. Ask around if there
 is anyone in your major

851
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,240
who's looking to rent.

852
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,340
- We should save every penny.
- Okay, Noona.

853
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,310
Wow, I should get ready, too.

854
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,380
Where should I go?

855
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,370
If Unni leaves to study overseas,

856
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,690
what do we do then?

857
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,890
Aigoo, seriously.

858
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,430
It'd be great if she leaves to study.
 It's for her own good.

859
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,700
What's with you?

860
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,410
Chae Woon, don't worry.

861
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,760
We'll be fine on our own.

862
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,370
Gosh, let's forget about 
everything for now.

863
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,330
Let's get ready 
for the birthday party.

864
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,650
- Let's go, Hwak Se. 
- Okay.

865
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,080
- Let's get ready.
- Move it.

866
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,570
All right.

867
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,020
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

868
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,680
I want to blow out the candles.

869
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,590
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫
 Wait, wait, wait.

870
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,650
♫  Happy birthday dear...  ♫
 Wait, wait, wait.

871
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,750
It's going off.

872
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,770
♫  Happy birthday dear...  ♫

873
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,790
 - Me, me, me! 
- Me!

874
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,210
You do it, Mom.

875
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,700
Me?

876
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,050
Okay, now...

877
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,110
♫  Happy birthday dear 
Bit Chae Woon  ♫

878
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:58,040
♫  Ra Hoon, Hae Deun  ♫

879
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,930
♫  And you, Mom  ♫

880
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,340
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

881
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,680
Let's blow them out. 
One, two, three!

882
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,400
Congrats!

883
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,930
Happy birthday!

884
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,490
Gosh, there are
 so many candles.

885
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,710
Happy birthday...

886
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:26,650
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

887
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,660
Gosh, so noisy.

888
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,890
 Today is Jang Eun Ho... 

889
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,960
 Brother Francesco's memorial service. 

890
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,130
We'll pray together for...

891
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,550
his peaceful rest.
 

892
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,280
Jesus said this.

893
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,750
I want to send it to 
Joon Ah oppa.

894
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,100
My pretty mommy.

895
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,000
Jae Hee.

896
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,190
Hello.

897
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,090
 God Almighty says... 

898
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,220
Face the front.

899
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,460
Face the front.

900
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,670
 At that point, 
the narrow path leads to... 

901
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,660
Whoa, that could've been bad.

902
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,670
You almost lost out 
on studying abroad.

903
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,330
Your dad helped her.

904
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,950
My unni thinks her husband 
takes care of everything.

905
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,120
Of course.

906
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,540
Will you go to the States as 
soon as they announce?

907
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,360
Yeah.

908
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,400
Probably.

909
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,740
You leave right away based 
on the schedule.

910
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,470
Gosh, stop jumping the gun.

911
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,140
It hasn't even been announced.

912
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,420
It's not guaranteed that Unni 
will win the competition.

913
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,980
She was one of 
the finalists last year.

914
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,420
I'm sure she'll make it this year.

915
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,100
Hae Deun is right.

916
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,530
Let's stop jumping the gun.

917
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:58,920
Yes, yes.

918
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,480
Always be careful what you say.

919
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,280
Okay, now, now.

920
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,130
You can stop jumping the gun,

921
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,880
but hop for the kimchi noodles.

922
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,880
- Here you go.
- Gosh, Uncle!

923
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,110
It's my favorite kimchi noodles.

924
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,980
This is my birthday gift to you.

925
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,840
I don't really like noodles.

926
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,590
Yes, don't eat if you don't like it.

927
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,450
Uncle, it's super good.

928
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:25,340
You know, I make good noodles.

929
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:29,200
You know, how you cook
 the noodle is crucial.

930
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,920
- How do you do it?
- Okay...

931
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,200
When the noodles 
are boiling in the water,

932
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,510
you dump the whole 
thing in the strainer.

933
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,570
And hit it with cold water.

934
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,890
Then they will go into a shock

935
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,860
and say, "Gosh, it's so cold. 
Turn off the AC."

936
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,410
You say, "No, wake up!"

937
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,300
The point is to shock the noodles.

938
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,980
Eat, eat.

939
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,960
 

940
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,600
Why? Work again?

941
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,870
Yeah.

942
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,820
Aigoo. The workday is over.

943
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,980
They don't let her rest.

944
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,450
Gosh.

945
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,550
Hello?

946
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,040
 Is this Bit Chae Woon? 

947
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,840
 I'm Manager Oh Byung Wook 
from Hanmaeum Adoption Agency. 

948
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,820
Yes, hello.

949
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,840
 Someone stopped 
by our agency today. 

950
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,950
 She wants to meet you, 
Bit Chae Woon. 

951
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,110
 She thinks you're her 
biological daughter. 

952
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,030
 Isn't it good? 

953
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,720
Did she see the blog I posted?

954
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,140
Gosh, what are they talking about?

955
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,050
Her soup is getting cold.

956
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,850
- Then I'll go and scold them...
- Gosh, Hwak Se...

957
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,080
We didn't get to eat our birthday 
miyukguk, thanks to Unni.

958
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,920
Your miyukguk is daebak.

959
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,640
The competition is still a test.

960
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,170
- Eat my noodles.
- I'll make you a pot of miyukguk.

961
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,400
- I have to heat this up again.
- Unni.

962
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,730
I'll do it.

963
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,270
You will?

964
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,790
Yes, see you tomorrow.

965
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,380
 If she wins the competition and 
leaves, I'll take her room. 

966
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,900
Who was it?

967
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,300
My work.

968
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,820
Hey.

969
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,880
Are you still looking for 
your birth parents?

970
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,850
Unni has no idea, huh?

971
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,410
That you're desperately seeking 
your birth parents, huh?

972
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,880
 Where will you go? 

973
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,010
Let's talk later.

974
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:24,210
This is why they say you 
shouldn't take in a human.

975
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,840
So what if she sacrificed 
her life to raise you?

976
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,510
Every chance you get,

977
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:39,070
you're looking for your birth 
parents. So ungrateful.

978
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,230
How about you, Auntie?

979
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,610
What's the point of Mom 
sacrificing to support you?

980
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:49,230
You always get ripped off
 and try to live off of her.

981
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,000
What did you just say?

982
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,760
You lost everything again, huh?

983
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,680
That Dr. Song or whatever.

984
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,870
You gave him everything as if 
he's the best man in the world.

985
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,700
He pushed you around again, right?

986
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,010
What did I tell you?

987
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,210
- I told you to watch out...
- Hey!

988
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,930
You scared me.

989
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,790
Be quiet.

990
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,120
- What did you just say?
- What's going on, you guys?

991
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,310
Why are you fighting again?

992
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,610
Man Jung, I asked you
 to get hot soup.

993
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,800
Unni.

994
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,930
This girl is ridiculous.

995
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,350
She saw me earlier, yet

996
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:22,390
she won't acknowledge me. 
She treats me like crap.

997
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,740
Man Jung.

998
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,260
Chae Woon had a rough day today.

999
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,370
- You let it go.
- Unni.

1000
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,810
Is she the only one 
having a rough day?

1001
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,090
I'm having a rough day, too!

1002
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,630
Unni, do you know who
 she just talked to?

1003
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,810
Right now, she's...

1004
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,620
I'll reveal it, too.

1005
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,810
You lost the apartment.

1006
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,630
We have no place to move to.

1007
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,650
What is it Chae Woon? 
What phone call?

1008
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,980
Did something happen on a site?

1009
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,640
No.

1010
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,380
Sorry, Auntie.

1011
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,920
I went through quite a bit today.

1012
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,040
I guess I was sensitive.

1013
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,940
Gosh. Aigoo.

1014
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,930
Yes, yes. Man Jung.

1015
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,450
Let it go.

1016
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:13,760
It's our birthday.

1017
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,430
And we're encouraging 
Chae Woon for the competition.

1018
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,950
You let it go.

1019
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,480
Let's do that, okay?

1020
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,020
Auntie, let it go.

1021
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,520
You know Unni could be super rude.

1022
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,690
Lee Hae Deun, you...

1023
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,130
Aigoo.

1024
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,120
Aigoo, why are we acting
 like this on a happy day?

1025
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,950
Okay, stop now. Let's go sit down.

1026
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,540
Unni, sorry. All right. 
I'll bring the soup.

1027
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,780
Go.

1028
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,830
- Let it go.
- Okay.

1029
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:38,660
All right?

1030
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,270
Let's go, Chae Woon.

1031
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,830
Let's go.

1032
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,530
Auntie...

1033
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,900
Yeah, we're fine.

1034
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,840
Things are fine 
at the company, too.

1035
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,860
I miss you, my son.

1036
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,600
Not again, Mom.

1037
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,790
Jang Joon Ah,

1038
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,430
did you get married over there? 
Why don't you come back?

1039
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,010
Yes.

1040
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,350
- Get back to work.
- Take care, Oppa.

1041
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,670
I'll call you.

1042
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,710
I'll call you again.

1043
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,750
CEO, you're not crying, are you?

1044
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,330
My heart breaks for you.

1045
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,770
Thanks for coming today.

1046
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,920
Don't mention it.

1047
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,300
My mother asked me to
 be like your son

1048
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,810
until Joon Ah comes back to Korea.

1049
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,120
Is your mother well?

1050
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,630
Yes, of course.

1051
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,480
I'll go ahead.

1052
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,910
Let's have dinner together.

1053
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,780
No, I have work stuff 
to take care of.

1054
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,440
You two enjoy dinner.

1055
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,250
Mom, drive carefully!

1056
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,860
- I'm leaving.
- Be careful going home.

1057
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,200
Bye.

1058
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,430
Score! This is great!

1059
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,320
From this moment on,
 you're mine.

1060
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,380
Come on, Jang Seo Ah.

1061
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,780
Check our manners and distance.

1062
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,900
No, I don't want to.

1063
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,730
We promised last time.

1064
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,260
- Who am I?
 - You're mine.

1065
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,860
Who am I?

1066
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,570
Who?

1067
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,460
- This won't do. I'm leaving.
- Wait!

1068
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,320
You're Joon Ah oppa's friend.

1069
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,360
Am I a man or a woman to you?

1070
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,500
A man or a woman?

1071
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,690
You're just an oppa.

1072
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,920
That's right.

1073
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,130
Seo Ah, this is how I can see 
you without expectations.

1074
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,350
I'm hungry. What do 
you want to eat?

1075
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,500
Well, whatever you want.

1076
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,270
I really love high-calorie food.

1077
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,700
Can you handle it, Seo Ah?

1078
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,480
- I can eat everything.
- Okay.

1079
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,570
You can't say, "Gosh, I gained 2 kg!"

1080
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,130
and regret it in the morning.

1081
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,520
Let's go.

1082
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,170
Let's go.

1083
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,190
I'm hungry.

1084
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,820
What are we eating?

1085
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,390
 She called after seeing 
the post and the photo 

1086
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,460
 you posted on the blog 
a long time ago. 

1087
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,010
 She said you resemble 
the daughter she lost. 

1088
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,490
 There's a record that says 

1089
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,300
 I grew up in an orphanage 
ever since I was two years old. 

1090
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,360
 I lived in the orphanage
 until I was five years old. 

1091
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,710
 When the orphanage
 director got married, 

1092
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:51,370
 I got adopted into her family  

1093
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,220
  and have lived with them ever since. 

1094
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,740
 If you want, after going through
 a confirmation process, 

1095
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,600
 we can set up a meeting with you. 

1096
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,190
Could she be the one this time?

1097
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,460
 This is why... 

1098
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,580
  they say you shouldn't 
take in a human. 

1099
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,220
My daughter.

1100
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,700
You went through a lot today.

1101
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,200
Mom, you weren't sleeping yet?

1102
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,040
I'm sleeping.

1103
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,640
How can you talk
 while you're sleeping?

1104
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,840
Because I'm a mom.

1105
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,430
When my daughter 
comes into my room,

1106
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,910
I speak in my sleep.

1107
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,500
What a lie.

1108
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,780
It's not a lie.

1109
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,470
My mom smells good.

1110
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,840
Chae Woon.

1111
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,780
Actually...

1112
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,310
I know.

1113
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,650
That your auntie...

1114
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,890
lost our apartment.

1115
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,220
Mom, you knew?

1116
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,240
But I won't tell her for now.

1117
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,710
Your auntie must be 
so upset about it.

1118
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,420
Since it happened again.

1119
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:03,290
A person's heart is 
the most important.

1120
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,600
It shouldn't get hurt.

1121
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,680
It's just money.

1122
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:12,300
So, don't say anything 
to her about it.

1123
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,270
Gosh...

1124
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:19,100
Well, I'm sure things
 will work out.

1125
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:25,860
I wish things would work out 
with your auntie and Dr. Song.

1126
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,200
You did well.

1127
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,550
 Sorry, Mom. 

1128
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:59,000
Eun Ho.

1129
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,870
How are you doing?

1130
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,670
It's already been over 
ten years since you left.

1131
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,640
We're all doing well...

1132
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,690
so don't worry.

1133
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,380
I'm fine as long as you're okay.

1134
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,820
If you ever...

1135
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,090
run into our Seo Yeon there, 
see how she's doing.

1136
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:30,340
No...

1137
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,850
This is too shameless of me.

1138
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,800
Right?

1139
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,360
Sorry.

1140
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,160
I miss you, Seo Yeon.

1141
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,860
 

1142
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:32,030
 

1143
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,540
This is the last time. For real.

1144
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,960
If she's not it, that's it.

1145
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,930
I won't look for her anymore.

1146
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,070
 

1147
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,950
Hi, Mom.

1148
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,370
 Are you busy? 

1149
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:16,410
Yeah, a little bit.

1150
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:20,100
I'm shopping for your jacket.

1151
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,530
 Why? I have one already. 

1152
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,120
I was washing your jacket
 this morning,

1153
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,110
and that white stuff 
won't come out easily.

1154
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:31,230
 Besides, you have only two jackets. 

1155
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,620
I'm unsure about the size,
 so I'll try it on.

1156
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,850
Take a look. I'll send you pictures.

1157
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,120
Looks nice.

1158
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,600
Okay.

1159
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:14,680
Yeah.

1160
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,820
Did you see?

1161
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,500
What number?

1162
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,800
I'll buy one later.

1163
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,600
 Today is the last day of the sale. 

1164
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,110
 What number? Hurry. 

1165
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,290
 I have to get back to work. 

1166
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,900
 What number? 

1167
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,700
Number two.

1168
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,600
Okay. Good day.

1169
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,490
 She says number two. 

1170
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:37,630
 My daughter sure has 
a great taste. 

1171
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,760
 It may not look that great on me, 

1172
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,300
 but my daughter is tall and slim. 

1173
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,370
 It will look great on her. 

1174
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,000
This is really my last time.

1175
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,460
Thanks to your support, CEO...

1176
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,540
many children are meeting
 wonderful adoptive parents.

1177
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:09,340
It's all thanks to you 
and your staff's help.

1178
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,180
I ask for your support
 in the future.

1179
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,850
Thank you.

1180
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,800
CEO.

1181
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,090
Give it to me.

1182
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,140
Thank you. I can't lose this...

1183
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,600
Bit Chae Woon, welcome.

1184
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,500
Hello, manager.

1185
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,050
She's over there.

1186
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,390
Hello.

1187
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,460
This is Lee Bit Chae Woon.

1188
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,370
- This is...
- Hyo Jung!

1189
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:38,700
Hyo Jung!

1190
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,580
My baby...

1191
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,100
My goodness...

1192
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,370
How did you live all this time?

1193
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,910
How did you live away
 from home?

1194
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,300
My gosh...

1195
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,310
Let me see...

1196
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,380
 I bought it! My daughter's
 cute jacket. 

1197
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,030
CEO?

1198
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,580
Is something wrong?

1199
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,620
No.

1200
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,860
I just feel...

1201
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,300
a little strange.

1202
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,240
 For some reason... 

1203
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,840
 I'm sad. 

1204
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,430
Gosh, this is cute, too.

1205
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,900
Gosh...

1206
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,410
This is so cute.

1207
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:59,630
This will look great 
on Chae Woon.

1208
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,210
Why don't you buy this, too?

1209
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,000
If I buy this one, too, 
my daughter will scold me.

1210
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:11,750
 Mom. 

1211
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,940
 I'm sorry. 

1212
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:24,470
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1213
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:32,530
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1214
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:39,070
♫  You're drawn to each 
other like the magnets  ♫

1215
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:41,090
♫  You part ways leaving
 a hole in your heart  ♫

1216
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,930
 

1217
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,560
 She must've grown up well. 

1218
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,480
 Even though you stole one of them. 

1219
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,590
 Driver, stop please! 

1220
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,010
 The design competition. 
I got the grand prize. 

1221
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:51,740
 - Daebak! Daebak!
- Noona, you're the best! 

1222
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,680
 Old people should step down? 

1223
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,730
 That's what that means! 

1224
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,810
 - Is that Hyo Jung?
- Why are you Hyo Jung? 

1225
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,210
 The test results are already out? 

1226
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,600
 What are you doing over there? 

1227
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,720
 When you get out, 
find Lee Soon Jung. 

1228
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,300
 She's the bundle of money. 

1229
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,600
 Lee Bit Chae Woon? 

1230
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,100
 
 It's a unique name, huh? 

1231
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,600
 Revoke my prize? 

1232
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,200
♫  Like a bird drenched...  ♫
