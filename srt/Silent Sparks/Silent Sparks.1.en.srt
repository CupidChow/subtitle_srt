1
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:50,123
I'm about to eat, help wipe it off.

2
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:52,147
- Wipe it off quickly.
- OK, OK, OK!

3
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:02,848
Your handwriting is so beautiful.

4
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:04,467
You didn't learn calligraphy.

5
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:07,256
No.

6
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:12,123
I need to wipe the table.

7
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,334
Did your mom bring food today.

8
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:16,388
Yes.

9
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,576
- Thank you.
- No.

10
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,584
Last time I reported a fake.

11
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:46,951
It's the second time, and it's still being refuted

12
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:48,631
I've reported it twice.

13
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:50,685
His one is very difficult to get through.

14
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,670
Not enough

15
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:54,068
I can't thank you enough.

16
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:55,977
I miss him so much

17
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,593
- I haven't seen him in a long time.
- Is your mom coming today.

18
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,890
- Should I have.
- Yes.

19
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:05,594
Everyone is so helpless.

20
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:16,352
Everyone has their own story.

21
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:22,750
If it's time to return to the government,
it's time to return it to.

22
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,148
It's right to be shut down.

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,398
Did anyone meet you today?

24
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:30,812
No.

25
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,200
"Silent Sparks."

26
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,780
Pua. Pua.

27
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,244
He's here.

28
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,684
Hurry up.

29
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,830
Fuck you!

30
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,142
Who is it?

31
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,642
Alright, enough.

32
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,250
Alright, that's enough.

33
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,333
You're gonna kill him!

34
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,001
Damn it! That's enough.

35
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:44,360
Let me grab some photos.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You wanna go back to jail?

37
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,298
Alright, let's go.

38
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:55,531
We're done here.

39
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,166
Anything new from Boss?

40
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:30,600
Let me know if he offers you a job.

41
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,306
I wanna tag along.

42
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:33,375
Shit.

43
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,041
Easy money for you.

44
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,125
What easy money?

45
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,822
I'm the professional photographer.

46
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,361
I took some great shots.

47
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,375
How about we switch tasks next time?

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,791
You can't do it.

49
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,458
It's not just snapping pictures.

50
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,850
Getting the right angles,

51
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,166
I zoom in and out.

52
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,375
You can't do it.

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,458
You're bullshitting.

54
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,975
There's a boss, he gave me

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,500
a job at the funeral parlor.

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,501
Wanna come along?

57
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,350
Need to bring our own “gear”?

58
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,375
Damn it man.

59
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,423
It's not that kind of job.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,708
The job's just loading stuff,

61
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,048
and filling space.

62
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,500
Easy money.

63
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,208
3 to 5 hours, easy couple grand.

64
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,747
I know you're strapped for cash.

65
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,564
You still owe compensation, right?

66
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,041
C'mon.

67
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,071
Alright, alright.

68
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,791
Line them up!

69
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,447
Don't nitpick!

70
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,916
C'mon.

71
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:15,657
I understand, Boss Kun.

72
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,516
But you can't put it like that.

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,808
He delivered a batch of waterlogged cartons.

74
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,208
Tried to fool me.

75
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,041
I'm sure you could understand.

76
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,852
Nah.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,916
How could I just hand my man over?

78
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,041
How about we cover his medical bills?

79
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,125
Sure.

80
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,165
Or he could just go to the police.

81
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,875
Or else, this argument will never end.

82
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,625
Right.

83
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,708
I understand.

84
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,500
Why bother you

85
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,916
with such trivial matter?

86
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,583
How inappropriate.

87
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,291
I understand.

88
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,625
Come over for tea sometime.

89
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,243
Alright.

90
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,250
Motherfucker!

91
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,791
Try to get others to negotiate with me.

92
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,708
OK then.

93
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,156
I can stir shit up too.

94
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,500
Look.

95
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,664
Just the right touch.

96
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,458
Loser like this.

97
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,333
Tries to mess with us.

98
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,585
Moron.

99
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,500
Boss.

100
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,833
About the money...

101
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,812
It's ready.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,083
Curly.

103
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,750
Bring me fifty grand.

104
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,445
Thanks.

105
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,708
Here.

106
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,208
Have a smoke.

107
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,500
Boss.

108
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,833
Let me know if you need my service.

109
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,458
You owe that much?

110
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,541
What?

111
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,875
Not afraid of getting locked up again.

112
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,000
Nah.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,710
Still paying for the last case.

114
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,833
You had it coming.

115
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,541
Served the wrong boss.

116
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,666
Shorty Ping's just a low-level crook.

117
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,458
If I were your boss then,

118
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,166
I would've handled it easily.

119
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,375
You heard the call just now.

120
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,208
I've your back, kid.

121
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:12,012
Fifty grand, Boss.

122
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,031
Fifty grand, give it a count.

123
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,958
Thank you.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,250
Count it.

125
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,083
Avoid any misunderstandings.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,416
Don't be reckless with the money.

127
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:32,140
Be filial to your mom.

128
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,054
If your mom didn't seek my help,

129
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,750
lad like you in the can,

130
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,208
young and good-looking.

131
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,109
Things could've ended up real nasty.

132
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,291
You know “nasty”?

133
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,875
I'm talking about getting it up your ass.

134
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,218
Take your time.

135
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,916
Right?

136
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:01,814
Right.

137
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,546
- All there?
- Yeah.

138
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,625
Thank you, Boss.

139
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,868
I'll head off then.

140
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,416
Take care.

141
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,291
Okay.

142
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,679
Oh, by the way,

143
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,491
your big brother is getting out.

144
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:20,898
Who?

145
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,656
Mi-Ji.

146
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,083
Why?

147
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,083
Forgot who he is?

148
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,500
I remember.

149
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,208
When you were about to go in,

150
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,708
your mom called me up.

151
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,375
I instructed him
to take care of you inside.

152
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,791
Having brothers looking out for you,

153
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,125
having your back,

154
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,781
life's much easier, right?

155
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,333
When's he getting out?

156
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,333
I think it's Thursday.

157
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,458
Or the week after?

158
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,458
It's Thursday.

159
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,166
Thursday...

160
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,140
Remember to pick him up.

161
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,291
Drive him wherever he wants.

162
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,820
Tell him to come by the office on Friday.

163
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:58,350
Make sure to tell him.

164
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,406
Okay, got it.

165
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,195
No worries.

166
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,083
It's typical for a one-year-old to be.

167
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,625
And, look at his name,

168
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,929
the character "Feng" is auspicious.

169
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:19,931
Born at midnight.

170
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,804
Destined for success.

171
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,666
Ah-Fen, hold on a sec.

172
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,264
Let me prepare something for my son.

173
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:29,625
No problem.

174
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,875
Where's your manners?

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,083
Aunty Ah-Fen.

176
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,625
Have some vermicelli.

177
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,367
I'm tired of them.

178
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:40,962
C'mon, do yourself a favor.

179
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:44,321
“Wang-Ye” says, eat for a hundred days.

180
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,789
See if it can change your fortune.

181
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,945
Aren't you afraid of getting arrested.

182
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,375
You've the fate of gangster.

183
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,515
Doesn't mean you've to do gangster deeds.

184
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:04,298
Aren't you keeping it?

185
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:05,823
Just leave it there.

186
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,833
You're the one who read my fate.

187
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,976
Perhaps I should try baseball?

188
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,250
Moron.

189
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,416
Never listens.

190
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,541
Nah. He's young.

191
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,583
Your grandson has better fortunes.

192
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,416
Like I said,

193
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,725
Destined for success.

194
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,641
What did he grab during his one-year?

195
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,375
A seal.

196
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,333
Government official.

197
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,500
A scallion.

198
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,007
A clever official then.

199
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:37,890
But he grabbed a microphone too.

200
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,125
That's good, a second skill.

201
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,958
Having multiple careers is trendy.

202
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,875
Singing is good too.

203
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,458
A singer?

204
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,541
Where do we see mic-holders?

205
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,484
They're all on TV.

206
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,916
You have a great life ahead.

207
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,789
Let's have another look.

208
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,208
What's Pua doing here?

209
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:28,958
When I'm out,

210
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,541
Take care of the shop.

211
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,916
No problem, Boss.

212
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:32,791
Boss.

213
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,500
Pua!

214
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,083
What brought you here?

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,291
I know Mi-Ji's out.

216
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,583
Wanna congratulate him.

217
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,083
Is that right.

218
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,476
That's thoughtful.

219
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,312
You're a catch. Blue Label for you.

220
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,375
Boss, why don't you hop in first.

221
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,833
Huh?

222
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't take too long.

223
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,103
Just a second.

224
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,125
Smart kid.

225
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,296
Why are you here?

226
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,041
Like I said,

227
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,666
Wanna congratulate you.

228
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,546
I just had one.

229
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,208
Alright, I got to go.

230
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:35,348
We've got stuff to do.

231
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,786
What took you so long?

232
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:56,017
Did I?

233
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:03,296
He's a good kid.

234
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,676
You took good care of him inside?

235
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,916
Nah, I treat them all the same.

236
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,625
All the boys I looked after were by you.

237
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,541
It a favor for his mom.

238
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,250
I knew his dad from back in the day.

239
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,926
Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

240
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,168
Ten bucks.

241
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,028
Give me a ten.

242
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,125
Have a look.

243
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,340
Hotties!

244
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:15,583
Can't appreciate?

245
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,791
Don't be rude.

246
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,750
Wanna play Mahjong later?

247
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,051
I don't know how to play.

248
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,625
Bumped into your boss there yesterday.

249
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,528
Yeah, he owns that place.

250
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,208
Not “The Boss”.

251
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,583
It's Mi-Ji.

252
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,875
You know him, right?

253
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,637
Huh.

254
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,958
He went to play Mahjong?

255
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,040
No shit.

256
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,791
Why else would he be there?

257
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,250
I'll win it all back in a round.

258
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:01,750
You'll be glad if you don't lose it.

259
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:04,944
Any 200/50 tables available?

260
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,333
All taken. Wait a sec.

261
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,346
Start a new table then.

262
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,918
Not enough players.

263
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,161
Hey.

264
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,583
I won.

265
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,223
I'm taking off.

266
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,000
Mi-Ji.

267
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,333
Why so sudden?

268
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,137
You've only lost a few rounds.

269
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:04,728
Lose to you again another time.

270
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:05,848
Excuse me.

271
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,250
Mr. Chen.

272
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,041
Find someone to fill in for me.

273
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,333
I'll do it.

274
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,125
That's a 300/100 table.

275
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,166
No problem.

276
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:22,958
Where are you going?

277
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,580
Sit along, bring me some luck?

278
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,840
Nah.

279
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,294
I'm coming.

280
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,208
Hello.

281
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:53,572
Hello.

282
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:56,781
Is Mr. Leung Tian-Chi home?

283
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:58,754
He's not in.

284
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:00,583
Are you his mother?

285
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,520
Yes.

286
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,684
He's involved in an assault case.

287
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,875
We called to summon him for questioning.

288
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,583
But he didn't answer the phone.

289
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,375
But I can't get a hold of him either.

290
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,166
The victim has filed a report.

291
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,041
Here's my business card.

292
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,458
Please ask him to come to the police

293
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,625
to answer some questions.

294
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:21,708
Okay.

295
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,500
I'll tell him as soon as he's back.

296
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,593
Thank you.

297
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,208
What time is it already?

298
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,429
Get up.

299
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:47,708
It's nothing.

300
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,671
Don't worry about it.

301
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,708
How's it "nothing"?

302
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,937
You like being in jail?

303
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:57,914
Worst case, I'll just pay the compensation.

304
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,583
You...

305
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,750
You never listen.

306
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,890
Boss.

307
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,041
Why's Pua summoned by the police again?

308
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,083
Yeah.

309
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,458
The police came by.

310
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,757
They want him in for questioning.

311
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,041
Yeah, see if you can resolve it.

312
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm looking for Liao Qing-Cheng.

313
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,583
What's the matter?

314
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,429
I'm here for questioning.

315
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:04,616
Hold on.

316
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,101
May 16th, 3 a.m.

317
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,179
Were you at Sec 3, Minren Road?

318
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,664
I don't recall.

319
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,101
I'm not gonna waste time with you.

320
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,625
You're caught on the surveillance camera.

321
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,695
And we traced your license plate.

322
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,801
See for yourself.

323
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,916
That's you beating him up, right?

324
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,750
The victim has identified you.

325
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,867
That's why we have you over.

326
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:41,736
Is that your friend next to you?

327
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:46,246
Alright then.

328
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,666
The victim has reported the case
with evidence.

329
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,250
But has yet to press any charges.

330
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,916
And you have a criminal record.

331
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,203
We just wanted you in for questioning.

332
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,166
So, we're going to court?

333
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,414
That depends on the other party.

334
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,125
If it's not too serious,

335
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,375
usually, it's settled out of court.

336
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,041
Depends on how you resolve it.

337
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,125
Take a look at this document.

338
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,791
If there is no problem,

339
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:18,916
sign at the bottom.

340
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:48,671
Other residents have also complained
about this issue.

341
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:52,391
I know you've tried to
resolve the problem.

342
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,500
The traffic is louder than the train.

343
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,585
It's not met the criteria to file for.

344
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,041
I understand.

345
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,031
The resident filed a complaint.

346
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,317
We have to address it.

347
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,937
Okay.

348
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,041
I think that's about it.

349
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:10,375
Should we explain it to the resident?

350
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,483
Sure.

351
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,539
Ru.

352
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,708
Others from our district have also
mentioned similar issues.

353
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,609
But there's nothing we can do.

354
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,500
You could install soundproof windows.

355
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,058
Maybe it'd help.

356
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,708
I can't afford them.

357
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:30,750
Look.

358
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,600
Rent, utilities, all these bills piling up.

359
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,666
And my son broke somebody's leg.

360
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,000
We're still paying compensation
every month.

361
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,500
I have no cash to spare.

362
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,583
Ma'am,

363
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,281
please sign here.

364
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,916
I'll keep it in mind.

365
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:45,875
Here?

366
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,083
That's it for today.

367
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,666
Do me a favor.

368
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,666
Okay, okay.

369
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,500
Thank you.

370
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:00,906
See if you can do something about it.

371
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:01,958
Okay, okay.

372
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,708
C'mon mom.

373
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,708
Why'd you bring that up.

374
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,958
Why? Embarrassed?

375
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,291
If you're embarrassed,

376
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,250
then stop doing shady businesses.

377
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,583
Didn't I give you the money.

378
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,179
You act like I squandered the money.

379
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,208
You made it sound nice.

380
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,541
Was that money for me?

381
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,538
It's to pay for compensation to the others.

382
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,093
Where are you going?

383
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,291
If only I had known,

384
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,308
I shouldn't have read that you've
the fate of gangster.

385
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,783
Who knows if one day
you'll flee like your father...

386
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:47,250
Alright, stop nagging.

387
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,875
My head's gonna explode.

388
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,708
You haven't finished the vermicelli yet.

389
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,875
You can throw them away.

390
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,634
Zih-Hao.

391
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:27,837
Zih-Hao.

392
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:29,833
Tell your friend.

393
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:32,275
Carry these water bottles to the table.

394
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,166
Distribute them?

395
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,375
Nah.

396
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,500
They can take it themselves.

397
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,933
Okay. I got this.

398
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:37,939
I'll leave it to you.

399
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,625
Asshole.

400
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,750
Why? Weak arms?

401
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:13,708
You dickhead.

402
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,875
Wear slippers to a funeral.

403
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,208
Unpresentable.

404
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:27,541
Boss.

405
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,666
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

406
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:29,986
Be quick.

407
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:35,372
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

408
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:36,850
What for?

409
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,750
Taking a dump?

410
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,293
Yeah.

411
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,125
Hey.

412
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:25,166
Evading me?

413
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,875
No.

414
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,583
You don't reach out at all.

415
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,458
Like we're strangers.

416
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,166
What?

417
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,176
What do you want?

418
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,708
Okay then.

419
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,145
Can't even have a word with you.

420
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,583
What are you talking about?

421
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:58,168
Are you playing dumb?

422
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,166
Alright, that's enough.

423
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,965
What's your problem?

424
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:05,619
What?

425
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,166
Pretending we don't know each other?

426
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:09,958
Why would I?

427
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,098
Or were you hit by a car?

428
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,583
Pretending to be crazy?

429
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,450
Alright, stop it.

430
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,700
Why not?

431
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:24,322
What are you afraid of?

432
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:26,442
Enough already.

433
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,916
The hell's your problem?

434
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:43,714
All bow to the portrait of Mr. Zhi-Yo

435
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:45,500

Please bow.

455
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,208

Haida Engineering.

463
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:46,666
Summoned by the court again.

464
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:49,163
Impressive.

465
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,500
Disobeyed Wang-Ye.

466
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,286
In trouble again.

467
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:14,916
( Mediation Notice )

468
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,801
Things are volatile
in the southern district.

469
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:29,708
Boss Kun, we need you to help us out.

470
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,541
I know.

471
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,500
Don't worry.

472
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll handle it.

473
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,541
Much appreciated.

474
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,416
Boss.

475
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,208
With Mi-Ji around,

476
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,391
he'll handle it.

477
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,416
You flatter me.

478
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:43,270
Boss Kun's guidance is crucial.

479
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:45,125
Okay.

480
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,884
Don't be so diplomatic.

481
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,978
Have some tea.

482
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,291
Boss.

483
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,501
What brought you here?

484
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,806
Boss, you said you would handle this.

485
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,541
I thought it's something serious.

486
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,314
What to do now?

487
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,244
Young people these days.

488
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,458
No manners at all.

489
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,861
It's written here.

490
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,322
Report for mediation on Tuesday.

491
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,791
Can't you read?

492
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,808
So, you're not going to handle it?

493
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,666
Motherfucker!

494
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,750
What's your deal?

495
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,333
Bigshot now?

496
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,556
Bold, huh?

497
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,375
Dare to talk back to me.

498
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,875
Who do you think you are?

499
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:14,892
Mi-Ji.

500
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,791
Your underling.

501
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,212
Teach him some manners.

502
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:26,262
Come with me.

503
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:28,517
Let's go.

504
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:30,833
Come on!

505
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:37,083
Motherfucker.

506
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,822
Think you're tough
because you've been to prison?

507
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:46,634
Get off me.

508
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,625
What the hell's wrong with you?

509
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,208
What's your deal?

510
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,625
You got some nerve!

511
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,330
Fuck. He's not helping at the mediation.

512
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,666
I'm ending up back in jail.

513
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:01,833
It is what it is.

514
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,428
You know it too.

515
00:34:03,453 --> 00:34:05,078
How did you end up in jail last time?

516
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,556
You're so capable, right?

517
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,189
You handle it.

518
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,041
You're the bigshot in there.

519
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,736
Took care of everyone.

520
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:37,056
We're out now.

521
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,500
Stop bringing up those stuff.

522
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,611
Okay?

523
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,408
Afraid of what others might say?

524
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:53,095
Why don't you tell my mom?

525
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,634
Tell what?

526
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,353
She wanted you to have my back.

527
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:06,962
She didn't ask you to fuck me.

528
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,666
Didn't you say,

529
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,375
Pua is a good kid?

530
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,173
Kid's quite bold.

531
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:56,954
Why don't you help him out?

532
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:58,642
I thought you know his mom?

533
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:01,900
C'mon.

534
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,554
He's too rowdy.

535
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:07,668
Can't keep his cool.

536
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,791
Let him back in.

537
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,291
He might come out a bigger shot.

538
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,833
Do you remember Ah-Cai, your cellmate?

539
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,916
He's out too.

540
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:36,650
I heard from his boss.

541
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:40,527
Is that so?

542
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,750
Did the two of you

543
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:46,333
have any beef?

544
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,875
What beef? We're just cellmates.

545
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,583
What's wrong?

546
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,250
Why bring him up?

547
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,000
Nothing.

548
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,958
Just happened to know each other.

549
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,166
What's up?

550
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,833
Nah, nothing.

551
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:13,583
Boss,

552
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,316
wanna you turn around?

553
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,798
Stop turning around.

554
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,486
I can't hold it anymore.

555
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:30,794
Let's head upstairs.

556
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,166
I'll get you to turn around.

557
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,165
Let me finish up.

558
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,500
This way please, Mr. Li.

559
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,000
On that day, my client's

560
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,833
cellphone, clothing and etc…

561
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:04,375
Were damaged due to the incident.

562
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,208
It's all listed on the form.

563
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,500
The total amount is NT$435,000.

564
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,291
The criminal record,

565
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,541
Is also a cause of concern.

566
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:14,625
Therefore,

567
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,750
We'd like for our proposed terms to b

568
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,666
by the end of the month.

569
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,083
Otherwise, we won't accept a settlement.

570
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,416
Any alternative proposals?

571
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,393
Anything you'd like to negotiate?

572
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,583
( Total Sum: 435,000 NTD )

573
00:39:57,861 --> 00:39:59,570
How much are you short?

574
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:01,806
I can loan you at an 8% interest rate.

575
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,470
Take it or leave it.

576
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:23,791
Alright. OK.

577
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,458
For Mi-Ji's sake,

578
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,958
interest free for the first month.

579
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,087
How about that?

580
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,000
A special offer for you.

581
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,526
For others,

582
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:38,593
the interest is usually 12-15%.

583
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,142
Motherfucker.

584
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,259
Litter brat acting like a bigshot.

585
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,416
You've checked it, right?

586
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:27,869
I'll stash it away.

587
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:38,634
When the time comes,

588
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,244
I'll let you know.

589
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:44,353
It's Mi-Ji.

590
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,064
I got work to do.

591
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,583
How much do you owe for the case?

592
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:40,650
500K.

593
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:44,791
Why?

594
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,750
You wanna pay for me?

595
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,736
I don't have 500k.

596
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,976
Why are you here then?

597
00:44:07,629 --> 00:44:09,203
I'm going back to work.

598
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:11,958
Hey.

599
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,500
If you end up inside again,

600
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,383
nobody's gonna have your back.

601
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,166
Who's that outside?

602
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,666
Nah. Just an underling.

603
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,000
Pua.

604
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,000
Who's gonna use it?

605
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:27,560
Teach him.

606
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,791
Here.

607
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,560
Magazine.

608
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,161
Safety.

609
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,505
Once the safety's off, it's ready to use.

610
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,000
You're just shooting at the gate.

611
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,583
No accuracy required.

612
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:47,000
Go ahead.

613
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,125
Give it a try.

614
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,166
Why are you helping me?

615
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,455
Where are you going at this hour?

616
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,083
Got work to do.

617
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,056
Don't worry. Go back to sleep.

618
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,291
Is there any vermicelli left?

619
00:50:54,828 --> 00:50:56,400
I'll finish them when I'm back.

620
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,626
Appreciate it.

621
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,083
What d'you want?

622
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:12,958
My treat.

623
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:14,257
For real?

624
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:15,500
Ma'am,

625
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,933
I'd have a combo.

626
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,000
You pick the rest.

627
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,166
I'll have a braised pork rice.

628
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,541
And tofu,

629
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,333
braised egg,

630
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,291
pork skin, skirt meat.

631
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,500
And a fish cake.

632
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,708
You're in a good mood.

633
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,083
Hit the jackpot?

634
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,166
What jackpot?

635
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,625
Don't be ridiculous.

636
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,083
What is it then?

637
00:59:49,481 --> 00:59:50,564
The case is settled.

638
00:59:51,937 --> 00:59:52,833
Settled?

639
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,416
500K?

640
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,500
Why didn't you ask for my help?

641
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:58,265
You bring bad luck.

642
00:59:58,583 --> 00:59:59,416
Fuck off.

643
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:00,791
What bad luck.

644
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:03,850
I wanted to chip in a little.

645
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:04,958
But you refused.

646
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,291
What you have are crumbs.

647
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:09,308
Keep them for yourself.

648
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,000
Rich huh? Big deal.

649
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:13,250
Unfortunately, the victim passed away.

650
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:17,208
The police have successfully arrested
one of the suspects.

651
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:20,208
Here's a deep dive into the case.

652
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:21,958
Surveillance footage reveals

653
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:27,183
the suspects parked across from
city councilor Shi Liangyuan's office.

654
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,568
One suspect got out of the car and

655
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:32,854
approached the office ten minutes later.

656
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,712
Ma'am.

657
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:35,250
Move aside.

658
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:39,041
Sorry.

659
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:40,375
He just got out of prison.

660
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,375
Hasn't watched TV in a long time.

661
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:44,333
The bullets struck office director Wang

662
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:46,250
who was still in the office.

663
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,933
The two suspects fired eight shots
at the iron gate of the service office

664
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:51,750
and fled the scene by car.

665
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:55,308
Regrettably, office director
Wang, 37, who's working...

666
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,208
Pua!

667
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:57,208
Where are you going?

668
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:05,382
(The police conducted
an overnight investigation)

669
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,523
(and apprehended the shooting suspect
at his home.)

670
01:01:08,547 --> 01:01:12,070
Let's take a look at the footage of the police
raid earlier, along with an explanation.

671
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,125
Open up!

672
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,625
You said the job's
just shooting up the door.

673
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,541
Why is there someone inside?

674
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:40,375
Who are you? I don't know you.

675
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:43,333
They arrested Mi-Ji!

676
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,333
What now?

677
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,500
What's your problem?

678
01:01:57,963 --> 01:01:59,755
Don't let me see you again.

679
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:46,208
You know Mi-Ji's my guy.

680
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:48,375
Nah.

681
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:51,250
Just calling to check in with you.

682
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:53,916
Yeah.

683
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,523
This is way too serious.

684
01:02:59,673 --> 01:03:01,833
How could this have anything to do with me.

685
01:03:02,931 --> 01:03:05,515
Your words are giving me chills.

686
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:10,791
How would I know who the other guy is.

687
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:14,541
Okay.

688
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,666
Please look after Mi-Ji.

689
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,291
I'll have Curly bring you some tea.

690
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:22,000
Okay.

691
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,250
I know.

692
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:26,541
Captain,

693
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:27,541
Thank you.

694
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,750
You guys went too far this time.

695
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,632
It's out of my reach.

696
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,720
You better find a place to hide.

697
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:52,329
Maybe head south or something.

698
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,931
Or else, they'll get you soon.

699
01:04:06,156 --> 01:04:07,989
What the fuck you want with me?

700
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:12,791
Don't give me this fucking attitude.

701
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:15,000
Is it my fault that Mi-Ji got caught?

702
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,708
Was he working my job?

703
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:21,375
Fuck.

704
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,500
It's all because of you.

705
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,157
Don't come around here anymore.

706
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:35,278
You'll drag us down with you.

707
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,681
Don't bring me trouble.

708
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:33,854
(A Councilor's assistant was shot.)

709
01:05:33,879 --> 01:05:39,144
(The prosecutor's office set up a special
task force for the investigation.)

710
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,986
What's your plan?

711
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,489
Where are you going?

712
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,791
Do you have a place to go?

713
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:56,809
I got him into this.

714
01:08:02,257 --> 01:08:04,668
Are you in the position
to worry about others.

715
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:27,551
I'm joining him.

716
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,507
Mom.

717
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,085
I'm sorry.
