00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:35,300
Why don't you use this opportunity
to write more respectable stories?

we put out isn't respectable,

You know the answer.

Seriously!

20 stories for $100,000,
maybe I should take up writing too.

00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:30,856
Things are so easy
when it's not your problem, huh?

360
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:34,259
How could I write something
I've never written before?

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,761
Then copy and paste.

at your fingertips. Comes with the job.

Write me a story, you fool! A story!

00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,368

use the term "mating".

no such thing in erotica!

That's why I enjoy adult romance stories.

They include courtship,
jealousy, and thrill...

00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:12,311
It's part of human nature.

That's so amazing!

502
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:45,011
I've read "The Adventures of Thomas",

- Yeah.

00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,234

Isn't it surreal that
someone still remembers Thomas?

509
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:11,246
Sure. It's so beautiful, it brings tears.

510
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:15,625
That's why I'm determined
to succeed as a fairy tale writer.

00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:18,779
And the erotica? Is it done?

513
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:27,180
This is intense, but there's no buildup.

514
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:30,974
Even for a copy-paste
job, this lacks effort.

515
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:33,227
They instantly go at it like animals?

516
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,796
You fucked someone
as soon as you met him once.

517
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,799
It was justified at the time.

518
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:43,094
The vibe, the emotion,
you gals wouldn't understand.

519
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:46,030

520
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,575
She's probably been
with at least 100 guys...

521
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,212
Over 100?

522
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,623
Definitely not 100.

00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,584
- Here you go, great job.
- Thanks.

534
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,418
- Tired?
- Not really.

535
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,529
- You should rest in the shade.
- It's okay.

536
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:27,550
Good job, take a break with others.

537
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:35,390
Come on, that's enough!

538
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:37,143
Wait a minute! Sorry!

539
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,646
- Chae Young, are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

540
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:42,966
Hey, don't get shoved around.

541
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:53,534
Hey, this is too much!

542
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:55,786
Sorry...

543
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:09,424
Crap...

544
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:17,265
"Angry 12 Inch"?

545
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:18,266
Shit!

546
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:20,602
"Shit"?

547
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:22,229
I'm sorry...

548
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,190
The reference is full of profanity.

549
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:28,193
You startled me.

550
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:30,612
But why does everyone
swear during the climax?

551
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:33,306
Because it feels good, I guess?

552
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:35,351
If it feels good, why curse?

553
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:38,412
Do you do that as well?

554
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:46,128
Well, I hear only beginners do that.

555
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:48,840
I'm usually on the receiving end.

556
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:52,217
So, you're experienced.

557
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:53,801
Come on now...

558
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:59,141
Then, as an expert,
could you take a look at my writing?

559
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,418
- Please...
- I have to go...

560
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:03,661
Just once...

561
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:06,022
Hm?

562
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:08,234
I'm getting off.

563
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:14,290
- You okay?
- Yeah.

564
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,403
- How is it?
- What?

565
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:54,946
Is it solid?

566
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,765
What? What is?

567
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:58,851
The story, is it solid?

568
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:02,622
Right, story...

569
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:04,978
I think it's okay now.

570
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,485
By the way, you used #1, #2, and #3...

571
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:11,906
It was the bare minimum of decency.

572
00:36:16,427 --> 00:36:19,972
The story is really interesting.

573
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,141
Thank you.

574
00:36:23,242 --> 00:36:24,851
For what?

575
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:26,937
It worked...

576
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,230
Pardon?

577
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:29,173
What?

578
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:31,092
You said something...

579
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,695
I meant, the story works...

580
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:39,783
I got drunk in your words,
which means, it worked...

581
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:43,495
Soju, it's like a craving for soju
at the bar next door.

582
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:45,372
Is that so?

583
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:49,793
Since you helped me, I'll treat you soju.

584
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:53,380
Since you're craving soju
because of me, so it's on me.

585
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:56,550
You don't have to go that far...

586
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:57,742
Aren't you coming?

587
00:36:57,743 --> 00:37:00,121
Ah, screw it, whatever.

588
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,317
- Aren't you Ms. Oh Ga Ram?
- What?

589
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,402
Hello, I'm the CEO of EroKing Corp.,

590
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,905
EroKing.

591
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:22,243
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

592
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:30,126
Dan Bi, you should take it easy.
It looks like you've already had a lot.

593
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:38,049
It's just that my insides
are completely burned out.

594
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,844
Because of $100,000?

595
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:47,293
Someone once told me that erotica
and fairy tales aren't so different.

596
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:50,021
Do you think so too?

597
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,233
I'm not sure.

598
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:58,820
But I found it quite enjoyable.

599
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,573
Isn't that good enough?

600
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:09,373
But in racing gear,
can you actually make it stand?

601
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,335
It's super tight spandex, though.

602
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:15,880
Why not? It's fully up!

603
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:19,508
No way, that's impossible.

604
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:23,261
Why is that so
impossible? It's fully erect!

605
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,139
- Don't listen to that.
- There are kids here.

606
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,890
Don't you know what that is?

607
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:28,850
- Super hard erection.
- What's "erection"?

608
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,602
You'll understand when you're older.

609
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,712
- Super hard erection!
- What is she even saying?

610
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:33,581
Dan Bi!

611
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:37,776
A real full erection
can even make this bottle stand up!

612
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:40,028
If not, it's flaccid!

613
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,697
- Dan Bi, I'm going home!
- Super hard erection!

614
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:43,698
You stay here, I have to go!

615
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,617
Keep the change, thank you!

616
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:47,536
- Super hard erection!
- Get home safely, I had fun.

617
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:48,895
Super hard erection!

618
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:50,481
Super hard erection! Erection!

619
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,088
That feels refreshing.

620
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:10,169
A real full erection
can even raise this glass bottle!

621
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,381
If not, it's flaccid!

622
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:16,858
Come on...

623
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,571
Ridiculous.

624
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:34,875
Okay!

625
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:26,636
Bebe!

626
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:44,778
No!

627
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:50,826
Climaxing in an elevator?
[Elevator]

628
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:53,061
How childish.

629
00:40:53,062 --> 00:40:56,023
Hey, can that really happen?

630
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:59,584
What about you?

631
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:00,944
It worked for me.

632
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:01,945
Yeah?

633
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,173
That actually works?

634
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,883
Should we turn it down again?

635
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:08,135
Don't.

636
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:10,637
We haven't seen Oh for a few days now.

637
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,080
Did something happen?

638
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:15,225
Hey, quick, give her a call!

639
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:17,353
She's suddenly unreachable?

640
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:22,899
Sir, I should really be
telling you this in person,

641
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,818
but I'm too ashamed to do that...

642
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:29,572
I'll never forget everything you taught me
despite my shortcomings.

643
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,075
She deposited contract
cancellation penalty.

644
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:35,746
That bastard strikes again!

645
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,502
[Geezer]

646
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,421
Moron.

647
00:41:46,983 --> 00:41:48,133
Welcome.

648
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:49,093
Hi.

649
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:52,095
Despite employing such an excellent writer,

650
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:54,664
Mr. Hwang treated you so poorly,
making you so thin,

651
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:57,293
he's too much, don't you think?

652
00:41:58,144 --> 00:42:01,647
This is made with beans, please try it.

653
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:10,739
It's so delicious.

654
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,203
Amazing things will happen in your life
from now on.

655
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:22,357
Why are you in bad terms with Mr. Hwang?

656
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:25,195
I heard you originally trained
for your debut under him.

657
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:29,174
We had some differing views on erotica.

658
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:32,010
Erotica should awaken
human instincts and desires,

659
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,830
and bring joy and pleasure to the masses,

660
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:36,707
isn't that what adult romance is all about?

661
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,104
This is the personal gym.

662
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:48,276
This is a lat pull down machine,
used for working out the upper back.

663
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,779
Want to give it a try?
I'll help with your posture.

664
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,948
Should I?

665
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:55,032
Hold onto this,

666
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,368
and sit down.

667
00:42:57,678 --> 00:43:01,122
Just pull, but focus on using your back.

668
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,792
Go ahead and pull.

669
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,878
Push your back in like this.

670
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:10,549
Once more, push your chest out.

671
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,450
You're doing well.

672
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:14,245
One more time.

673
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:18,099
One second.

674
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:20,393
It's getting a bit hot.

675
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:27,399
Sir, next time...

676
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,567
It's okay.

677
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:31,011
Bad posture can cause injuries,
so, let me spot you.

678
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:32,096
Go ahead, grab it.

679
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:34,031
Good.

680
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:38,411
That's it.

681
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,216
Can I kiss you?

682
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:55,303
You already did though...

683
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,062
Wait a minute...

684
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,398
Sorry...

685
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:44,976
So, who did you do it with?
Your boyfriend? The other guy?

686
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,230
Obviously... Here we go.

687
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:51,525
Obviously, what?

688
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:53,527
Both of them.

689
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:54,569
You are incredible!

690
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,823
Then who did you do it with first?

691
00:44:57,824 --> 00:44:59,324
Both at once.

692
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:00,617
What?

693
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:02,077
A threesome?

694
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:05,038
You had a threesome? In Korea?

695
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,206
Was it consensual?

696
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:08,700
Can you tell everyone in the world?

697
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:10,119
Let's go as princesses.

698
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,796
You need to put some lipstick on.

699
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:13,923
I don't have one.

700
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:15,842
Let me borrow this.

701
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:19,095
This one's huge.

702
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:21,063
Is it new?

703
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,975
No!

704
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:46,705
No matter how you look at it,
it's super convincing.

705
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:49,040
This is the best for climaxing.

706
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:52,986
I'm dating my boyfriend for eight years
because of this.

707
00:45:52,987 --> 00:45:56,115
What's so good about vibration?

708
00:45:57,007 --> 00:46:02,053
Innocent child, the reason is,
the clitoris is like the man's dick.

709
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:05,207
If you rub this vibrator on it...

710
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,626
That's so hot.

711
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:15,108
People think the clit is just the tip,
but that's only the tip of the iceberg,

712
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:18,778
the clitoral roots split into two branches
and surround the entrance of the vagina.

713
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:23,116
That's why thicker things feel good
because they stimulate the clitoral roots.

714
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:25,018
"G-spot".

715
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:27,438
As for the length...

716
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:31,541
an iPhone mini is enough.

717
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,086
Hey, show me your phone.

718
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:40,175
But there are two more spots
deeper inside the vagina.

719
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:43,637
So if it's thick and long,

720
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:45,222
it's the best.

721
00:46:45,223 --> 00:46:47,457
Galaxy Ultra, you win!

722
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,543
I win!

723
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:54,922
This reminds me of when your boyfriend
was in military service.

724
00:46:54,923 --> 00:46:55,923
Jeez...

725
00:46:56,692 --> 00:47:02,240
During your eight-year relationship
with Hee Min, you never cheated once?

726
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,243
Kang Jung Hye, you should spill it too.
What is it?

727
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:08,871
- Private Kang Jung Hye, what do you mean?
- You did?

728
00:47:08,872 --> 00:47:11,832
- Didn't you also have a little something?
- Shutting up, sir.

729
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,608
Confess and find redemption!

730
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:15,695
What is it? I'm curious, soldier!

731
00:47:16,754 --> 00:47:18,047
Everyone, attention!

732
00:47:20,024 --> 00:47:21,049
Salute!

733
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,510
Loyalty!

734
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:32,932
We had chemical warfare training today,
and everyone was in tears...

735
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,106
Sorry. Army talk is boring, right?

736
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:37,382
Nope.

737
00:47:37,383 --> 00:47:39,844
I'm just glad to hear your voice.

738
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:44,157
It reminds me of the
eve of your enlistment.

739
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:48,995
Yeah, I remember, everyone was drunk...

740
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:53,290
Dummy, I wasn't drunk.

741
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:59,779
If Dan Bi wasn't there,
I'd have done stuff to you.

742
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
What?

743
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:05,136
If she wasn't there,

744
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:09,307
would you have done something to me?

745
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:14,103
Uh, sure, yeah...

746
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:15,897
How?

747
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,567
How would you have done it?

748
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:22,570
Uh, everything you like...

749
00:48:25,548 --> 00:48:27,465
What I like?

750
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,911
What's that? Tell me.

751
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:35,415
You love it when I stroke your hair.
Kiss you while stroking you...

752
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,709
And then?

753
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:41,087
Hug you, and then...

754
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,132
And then? Then what?

755
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:45,759
Go ahead or I'm hanging up.

756
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,469
Hey, hey!

757
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,555
I'd, like, just, touch you, like this...

758
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:52,182
- Yours?
- Mine...

759
00:48:52,183 --> 00:48:53,517
What about yours?

760
00:48:53,518 --> 00:48:55,377
- Mine, uh...
- Is it hard?

761
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:57,129
Tell me more!

762
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,442
Sweetie, someone's here.

763
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:03,652
What?

764
00:49:03,653 --> 00:49:05,679
I'll come visit you, I gotta go.

765
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,681
Wait, Jung Hye!

766
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:11,160
Jung Hye!

767
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:21,337
Jung Hye!

768
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:27,852
Jung Hee Min, perfect shot.

769
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:35,643
- Salute!
- Hey.

770
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:36,918
You ranked first in training.

771
00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:38,933
Here. You got an overnight leave.

772
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,218
Private First Class, Jung Hee Min!

773
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,619
Thank you!
[Overnight Leave Granted]

774

Jung Hee Min!

775
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:51,616
Salute!

776
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:53,560
Private First Class, Jung Hee Min!

777
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,646
You're lucky, your girlfriend's here.

778
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:57,622
Take the return vehicle later.

779
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:59,961
- Jung Hye!
- Take the return vehicle!

780
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:02,795
Jung Hye!

781
00:50:06,424 --> 00:50:07,424
No way...

782
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,514
How long has it been?

783
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,666
About three years, I think?

784
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,462
Who did you come here to see?

785
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:21,814
Um...

786
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:24,400
my cousin.

787
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,400
I see.

788
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:33,366
Goddammit!

789
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,204
Sorry for what happened back then.

790
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:39,165
No, it's fine, I forgot all about it.

791
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,419
I'm getting discharged soon,
can I contact you then?

792
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,378
What?

793
00:50:49,692 --> 00:50:51,718
It's already time for me to go.

794
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:54,805
The last bus is coming, I have to go.

795
00:50:54,806 --> 00:50:55,848
Sorry.

796
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:00,603
I've missed you...

797
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:19,956
Stop...

798
00:51:32,218 --> 00:51:34,470
[With Grit! With Guts! Give It All!]

799
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:38,849
Pvt. Jung, go to the
family visitation room.

800
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,017
Jung Hye.

801
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:54,615
- Are you okay?
- Sorry, sorry...

802
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:57,761
[Baby! Don't get sick and do well.
I'll be waiting for you.]

803
00:52:57,762 --> 00:52:59,371
Jung Hye...

804
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:01,582
Sorry for being late...

805
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:06,938
Jung Hye!

806
00:53:09,957 --> 00:53:10,982
What is it?

807
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,275
Does something feel off?

808
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,152
No, not at all.

809
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:15,571
It's even more solid.

810
00:53:16,656 --> 00:53:18,199
The story, I mean.

811
00:53:20,426 --> 00:53:22,202
I'll get going now, I'm tired...

812
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:24,855
Help me out a bit.

813
00:53:24,856 --> 00:53:26,315
Let's go together.

814
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,918
Why are you walking like that?

815
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:31,504
I've been sitting for too long...

816
00:53:37,485 --> 00:53:38,510
Aren't you getting in?

817
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:40,263
Yes, I will.

818
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,996
Coming in!

819
00:54:21,821 --> 00:54:23,263
Excuse me.

820
00:54:23,264 --> 00:54:25,249
Yes? What is it?

821
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,501
It's nothing...

822
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:49,414
Why isn't she answering?

823
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:50,604
Something wrong?

824
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:53,986
No, it's just I feel
shitty for some reason.

825
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:56,964
You must really like her.

826
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:01,802
She's a very pure person.

827
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:05,247
Her mind is filled with
nothing but fairy tales.

828
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:06,624
I see...

829
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:22,781
Eh? There's no room?

830
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:24,449
No, no, there is.

831
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,268
- Come in, come!
- Yeah?

832
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:27,603
Pardon me!

833
00:55:29,497 --> 00:55:30,665
Thank you!

834
00:55:58,234 --> 00:56:00,778
"Real Man"? This is a bit...

835
00:56:02,697 --> 00:56:03,906
By the way,

836
00:56:04,924 --> 00:56:08,076
who did you learn to write from?

837
00:56:08,077 --> 00:56:10,413
Why? What's weird this time?

838
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:12,038
No, no, it's good.

839
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,543
The basics are really solid,
that's why I'm asking.

840
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,003
Who was it?

841
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:20,005
From my dad.

842
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:21,882
Oh, your dad.

843
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:25,927
He won the National
Literary Contest in 2003.

844
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:28,180
Is that so?

845
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:31,599
If it was in 2003...

a grand prize nowadays?

00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,507
Could you leave, please?

857
00:57:03,508 --> 00:57:04,925
Why did I lose, huh?

858
00:57:04,926 --> 00:57:05,926
Let go of me!

00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:08,411

Ms. Yoon, could you open the door? It's me.

1074
01:12:39,277 --> 01:12:40,570
Ms. Yoon!

1075
01:12:44,423 --> 01:12:48,285
You're inside! I can hear the ringing!

1076
01:12:48,286 --> 01:12:49,620
Jesus Christ...

1077
01:12:50,663 --> 01:12:51,914
Jeez...

1078
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:56,627
Should I give it all up
and just write erotica?

1079
01:12:57,311 --> 01:12:59,171
That would be great.

1080
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:02,090
Who cares what people say, right?

1081
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:03,675
Sure...

1082
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:07,762
Since I only need my laptop,
I could write while traveling.

1083
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,247
That's true.

1084
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:10,513
That sounds amazing.

1085
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:15,145
Thanks for the coffee, I'm off.

1086
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:17,063
Leaving already?

1087
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:21,259
I see that you're fine, so I better
be going. No point in staying.

1088
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,304
Do I look fine?

1089
01:13:25,756 --> 01:13:27,866
Do I look okay?

1090
01:13:27,867 --> 01:13:30,326
Who do you think messed up my life?

1091
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:34,248
You barged into my
life, I was doing just fine...

1092
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:37,417
Is that so?

1093
01:13:37,418 --> 01:13:40,111
I did that?

1094
01:13:40,112 --> 01:13:43,991
I ruined your life by barging into it?

1095
01:13:46,392 --> 01:13:47,894
Only fairy tales matter?

1096
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:53,316
If you just drop this prejudice
about what's okay and what's not,

1097
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:57,355
your life would've been much freer.

1098
01:13:58,898 --> 01:14:01,859
Were you happy writing fairy tales?

1099
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:07,365
It wasn't just a task
you had to complete for your father?

1100
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:10,326
Tell me I'm wrong.

1101
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:28,963
Don't worry, she'll be back.

1102

He ran off twice.

1103
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,555
Three times for this guy.

1104
01:14:31,556 --> 01:14:34,015
At least I answered my phone.

1105
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:35,058
I was sick.

1106
01:14:35,059 --> 01:14:38,770
Good job, so proud of you two.

1107
01:14:38,771 --> 01:14:40,897
Stop it, will you?

1108
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:43,049
If she doesn't come back,
there's nothing we can do.

1109
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,343
Here, take this.

The princess left for the prince's kingdom.

1111

Did you eat?

1112
01:15:14,182 --> 01:15:20,979
So, you watched 50 pornos a day,
and sent erotica to the contest?

1113
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,230
You think that's funny?

1114
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:23,648
It sure is!

1115
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:28,487
I hadn't laughed in a while,
you really are a good daughter.

1116
01:15:28,488 --> 01:15:32,307
Mom, should I just quit everything
and come live with you?

1117
01:15:32,308 --> 01:15:34,519
I'll write fairy tales under a pen name.

1118
01:15:35,595 --> 01:15:37,198
That sounds annoying.

1119
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:42,209
Why are you and your dad
letting fairy tales run your lives?

1120
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:44,336
I can't even stand the sight of it.

1121
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:47,589
If he hadn't won it,
he would've done whatever he wanted.

1122
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,257
He did, his whole life.

1123
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:51,176
You don't know?

1124
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:53,678
He wrote fairy tales because of you.

1125
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,224
You pumped him up
by saying he looked cool writing stories.

1126
01:15:57,225 --> 01:16:00,893
How could your simple dad not resist that?

1127
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:04,231
But now his kid writes blasted fairy tales
because of him?

1128
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:07,235

What's the website for reading
your stories? I want to check it out.

01:16:32,678 --> 01:16:34,511
Forget it, what for?

1135
01:16:34,512 --> 01:16:39,474
Why not? Let me read my
daughter's erotica, okay?

1136
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:40,767
No way.

1137
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:42,269
Ma'am, I brought the book!

1138
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:44,688
Okay, one second!

- Hurry.

01:23:57,294 --> 01:23:59,981
- It's really late.

01:23:59,982 --> 01:24:02,235
- So late.
- I didn't know!

1251
01:24:03,127 --> 01:24:04,754
Let's get going!

1252
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:09,090
Where are you going?
Why are you running away?

1253
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:10,760
It's super late!

1254
01:24:21,245 --> 01:24:22,813
You scared me.

1255
01:24:22,814 --> 01:24:24,356
- Ms. Oh.
- Sir.

I know it's about me!

1259
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:32,824
No, it's not.

1260
01:24:34,033 --> 01:24:35,785
It is my story!

1261
01:24:41,249 --> 01:24:42,542
I said it's not.

1262
01:24:45,061 --> 01:24:46,678
Remove the story!

1263
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:50,558
If you don't, I'll report you.

1264

How are you going to report me?

1265

stories are about them.

1266
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:06,064
But they just shut up
and get lost on their own.

1267
01:25:09,485 --> 01:25:11,028
You should get lost too.

and post about a one-night stand,

That's probably the marketing angle...

1291

He's exploiting the fact that
it's hard for the victims to report it.

if they do, it won't be easy to prove...

why not just sleep with the prince?

- She can.
- Exactly.

1355
01:31:55,099 --> 01:31:58,310
They're basically having a one-night stand
after the ball.

you just leave because it's midnight?

She turns into a pauper.

1358

Snow White gets revived by the prince
and is brought back to the castle.

Afterward?

1365
01:32:25,463 --> 01:32:28,131
The story begins in the courtroom.

1366
01:32:28,132 --> 01:32:32,536
Snow White and the eldest dwarf
have an affair, so they're on trial.

1375
01:32:59,914 --> 01:33:03,959
The princess was happy
after coming to this castle.

1376
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:09,840
I felt my job here was done,
so I packed my things to leave,

1377
01:33:09,841 --> 01:33:11,675
but then, a gust of
wind blew out the candle,

1378
01:33:11,676 --> 01:33:14,761
and suddenly, I was grabbed from behind!

1379
01:33:14,762 --> 01:33:16,221
Oh my, oh my!

1380
01:33:16,222 --> 01:33:18,223
When did I ever do that?

1381
01:33:18,224 --> 01:33:24,688
They explored every inch of my body

1382
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:28,441
with their tongue and hands,
as if they knew men so well,

1383
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:30,443
and it felt too good to resist...

1384
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:31,778
I did?

1385
01:33:31,779 --> 01:33:35,615
The tongue inside the mouth is hot, right?

1386
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,951
With that hot tongue, from my back...

1387
01:33:37,952 --> 01:33:43,248
licking like this,
downward, downward, continuously...

1388
01:33:43,249 --> 01:33:47,127
it grazed my chest, sliding downwards,

1389
01:33:47,128 --> 01:33:53,300
until finally, it circled around my
belly button, one and a half times...

1390
01:33:53,301 --> 01:33:55,243
So embarrassing...

1391
01:33:55,244 --> 01:33:57,788
Then their hands slipped into my pants!

1392
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,558
And grabbed...

1393
01:34:01,576 --> 01:34:03,226
my...

1394
01:34:03,227 --> 01:34:05,021

1397
01:34:11,277 --> 01:34:14,196
Shut up! When did I?

1398
01:34:14,197 --> 01:34:16,072
- You shut up!
- You stay out of it!

1399
01:34:16,073 --> 01:34:17,699
Can't we just kill her first?

1400
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,351
Yeah, let him finish!

1401
01:34:19,352 --> 01:34:20,937
The one I love...

1402
01:34:22,597 --> 01:34:24,331
is not Snow White.

1403
01:34:24,332 --> 01:34:25,500
- What?
- Huh?

1404
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:30,713
Please be happy.

1405
01:34:33,674 --> 01:34:34,801
I'll head up first.

1406
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:40,764

1407
01:34:40,765 --> 01:34:42,016

1408
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:48,063

1409
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,858
He's handsome too,
both brothers are so hot!

1410
01:34:58,549 --> 01:35:02,076
So, the younger brother
framed him to get killed.

1411
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:07,707
It's like you twisted a mystery
with a gay element.

1412
01:35:09,585 --> 01:35:11,796
- I want to read the next one.
- You do?

1413
01:35:11,797 --> 01:35:16,758
A lot of women are into erotica,
so the gay twist will work.

1414
01:35:16,759 --> 01:35:20,887
I wasn't going hard on the gay story,
it's a love story.

1415
01:35:20,888 --> 01:35:22,347
- Love?
- Yes.

1416
01:35:22,348 --> 01:35:25,959
You two have been together a lot lately.

1417
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,336
Sticky like glue.

1418
01:35:28,696 --> 01:35:31,949
What's wrong with sticking together?

1419
01:35:39,532 --> 01:35:41,075
