1
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:21,146
INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

2
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:26,026
BUT ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS PORTRAYED
ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,448
WHAT IS THE TRUTH THEN?

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,244
"Sometimes the truth
lies on the far side of the moon."

5
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:40,040
"But that doesn't mean
what's on the near side is fiction."

6
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,167
By Truman Shady.

7
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,712
Come on! Haven't you heard that one?

8
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,172
Of course I have!

9
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,341
There could be all kinds
of bullshit happening in the dark,

10
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,801
but people only believe what they see.

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,763
And that becomes the truth,
like the news.

12
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,140
Maybe it's the moon making you talk crap.

13
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,101
No matter which side you look at,
it's still the moon.

14
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,188
You're the one barking nonsense, not me!

15
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,357
Are you calling me a dog?

16
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,317
She's here.

17
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,864
Thank you for coming at such a late hour.

18
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,825
Oh, you're even more beautiful in person.

19
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,078
Here are two pieces of news.

20
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,370
The first one is…

21
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,873
Sixty-six days ago, an aircraft flying
a domestic route

22
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,416
was hijacked by the puppet army's spies…

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,543
ANNIHILATE THE US IMPERIALISTS!

24
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,088
…and 51 of our citizens
were abducted to North Korea.

25
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,714
And today, 66 days on…

26
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,216
FEBRUARY 14, 1970
IMJIN RIVER, SOUTH KOREA

27
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,011
…39 passengers
were finally returned to freedom.

28
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,264
However, the remaining 12 passengers are
still being held hostage in North Korea

29
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,433
and are unable to return.

30
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,396
They locked us up one by one

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,899
and then subjected us
to brutal electrical torture.

32
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,611
One of the men lost his mind…

33
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,404
And the second piece of news.

34
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,324
MARCH 15, 1970
TOKYO, JAPAN

35
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,535
Today in Komagome, Toshima, Tokyo,

36
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,663
the leader of the Red Army Faction,
a violent extremist anti-government group,

37
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,623
Tadashi Yamamoto,
has finally been arrested.

38
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,919
The Red Army Faction is the most violent
anti-government Communist group,

39
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:12,423
and has partaken in the Tokyo University
struggle in the past.

40
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,468
They have armed themselves
with weapons and homemade bombs

41
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,639
and evolved into a terrorist organization.

42
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,226
Revolution!

43
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,479
These two pieces of news
were from different countries

44
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,273
and had little in common.

45
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,275
Until recently.

46
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,237
Correlations can be drawn
and erased just as easily.

47
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,906
All it takes is a bit of creativity

48
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,368
and the willingness to suspend disbelief.

49
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,955
GOOD NEWS

50
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,376
We found this among your belongings.

51
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,004
What does it mean?

52
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,430
I'm not that familiar with English.

53
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,018
What does that say?

54
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,062
And the third piece of news starts here.

55
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:16,738
MARCH 31, 1970
HANEDA AIRPORT, JAPAN

56
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,332
Relax.

57
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,125
We're Ashita no Joe.

58
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,672
We're Ashita no Joe.

59
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,344
Back then, there were no metal detectors
or security screenings.

60
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,430
From that day on,
all of that became mandatory.

61
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,141
You could say these nine lunatics

62
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,645
contributed toward improving
Japan's aviation security systems.

63
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,605
Go ahead, please.

64
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,648
Ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,945
welcome aboard Japanese Ride Flight 351
headed to Itazuke.

66
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,364
We'll be departing shortly,

67
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,366
so please fasten your seat belts.

68
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,577
Try opening the top and then pulling it.

69
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,792
It's an honor to fly with you, Captain.

70
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,337
What's wrong?

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,506
Shouldn't you be smiling today?

72
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,674
Why?

73
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,510
You're about to hit 10,000 flight hours.

74
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,928
How does it feel?

75
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,180
Painful.

76
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,765
What?

77
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,893
Spending 10,000 hours in this tiny seat

78
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,520
has exacerbated my hemorrhoids.

79
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,647
Are they that bad?

80
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,107
Malignant.

81
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,402
If it was cancer, it'd be terminal.

82
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:43,950
It's a shame that it's too intimate
for you to show off.

83
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,952
Why would I show them off?

84
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,914
They're more like a medal of honor.

85
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,293
I bet your hemorrhoids
want to scream out loud,

86
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:58,256
"I am the result of 10,000 flight hours!"

87
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,136
Preflight checklist.

88
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,887
Preflight checklist.

89
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,399
Ma'am.

90
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,570
Would you like me to store your bag
to give you more legroom?

91
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,407
Look.

92
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,786
Do you get paid extra

93
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,414
if you fake a smile like that?

94
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,208
My apologies.

95
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,569
I remember now.

96
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,577
HJ stands for…

97
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,084
Hijack!

98
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,461
CHAPTER 1
HIJACKING

99
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,807
Keep your heads down!

100
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,022
Shut up!

101
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,361
Ladies and gentlemen,

102
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,364
there has been a minor interruption
on the flight.

103
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,034
We apologize for any inconvenience
this may cause.

104
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,329
Allow us to formally introduce ourselves.

105
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:00,461
We are a Communist League
called the Red Army Faction.

106
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,882
Hello. I'm Shinichi Ishida,
the deputy minister of Transport.

107
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,260
Today, Japan has…

108
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,014
ended up with what Marx called
high capitalism.

109
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,517
The Expo '70 showcases

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,521
Japan's rapidly progressing economy…

111
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,189
We hereby declare!

112
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:26,112
In order to crush
bourgeois capitalist power,

113
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,531
we came to a conclusion
that there is no other option

114
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,491
but armed revolution.

115
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,619
The decision must have been
difficult to make.

116
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,372
Will you be attending
the opening ceremony?

117
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,957
Of course. And…

118
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,380
-Mr. Ishida?
-Yes, I will be attending.

119
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,257
The Ministry of Transport has a lot--

120
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,806
Well, that's live TV for you,
ladies and gentlemen.

121
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,600
-We apologize for--
-Fuck!

122
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,767
Those bastards!

123
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,812
Dear viewers!

124
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,938
Where are they headed?

125
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,231
Pyongyang?

126
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,693
Did you just say Pyongyang?

127
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,614
Does it look like we're going
on a Hawaiian vacation?

128
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,701
We're not doing this to go hula dancing!

129
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,329
We're going to build a military base.

130
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,789
Do you even know what North Korea's like?

131
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,418
Of course we do.

132
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,088
And yet you're still taking
all those people with you?

133
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,924
Don't you know what will happen to them?

134
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,675
Unfortunately,

135
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,887
some sacrifice
is inevitable in a revolution.

136
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,306
Every one of us is prepared to die.

137
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,358
And if anyone gets in our way…

138
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,113
we're ready to kill them.

139
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,451
As long as we can get to Pyongyang…

140
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,663
we will do

141
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,123
whatever it takes.

142
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,879
A little to the left.

143
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,132
I do not know how to get to Pyongyang.

144
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:15,429
No commercial Japanese aircraft has ever
entered North Korean airspace before.

145
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,348
Wait.

146
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,683
Maeda.

147
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,769
You've been there, haven't you?

148
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,229
What?

149
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,441
I became a naturalized Japanese citizen
more than ten years ago.

150
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,361
And my parents are from South Korea,
not the North.

151
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,824
Then I suppose we have no other choice.

152
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,785
Can't you just follow the radar?

153
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,747
Ground control gives us orders,
go this way or that way.

154
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,166
Do you know the radio frequency
for Pyongyang air traffic control?

155
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,879
You don't know it?

156
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,464
How on earth would we know it

157
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,425
when we don't even have
any diplomatic ties to them?

158
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,385
Next time you try hijacking,

159
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,887
try doing your homework first.

160
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,349
Stop! Stop it!

161
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,644
That's enough! Pull yourself together.

162
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,731
How will you get to Pyongyang
if you beat up the pilot, huh?

163
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,359
My apologies.

164
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,363
Let us be mindful of each other

165
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,407
until we reach our destination.

166
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,244
This is a domestic flight.

167
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,872
We don't have enough fuel
to go to Pyongyang.

168
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,791
We need to land at Itazuke
as planned and refuel--

169
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,210
What bullshit
are you pulling now, old man?

170
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,967
You know, actually…

171
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,638
I think one pilot is plenty.

172
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,809
But the fuel isn't.

173
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,775
Later, I saw on the news

174
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,778
that they actually had enough fuel, but…

175
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,822
What else could they do?

176
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,160
The hijackers had no clue
what or where the fuel gauge was.

177
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,414
And the brave pilots used that
to their advantage.

178
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,832
FUEL GAUGE

179
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,292
STILL FULL

180
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,298
ITAZUKE TOWER

181
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,551
Requesting to land as scheduled
at Itazuke for fuel.

182
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,346
They are arriving in 20 minutes!
Are the riot police unit on their way?

183
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,105
The hijackers demand the following.

184
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,024
The Self-Defense Forces and the police

185
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,069
must not approach the aircraft
while it's refueling.

186
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,364
After refueling,
we'll head straight to Pyongyang.

187
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,949
So we demand a map and a compass.

188
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,828
The hijackers have liquid explosives.

189
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,163
If their demands aren't met,

190
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,500
they're threatening to detonate them.

191
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,531
Damn it! I knew they'd do this!

192
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,492
The riot police units are everywhere!
Brace for a shootout!

193
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,369
Bring the hostages over!

194
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,787
Nobody move!

195
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,581
Please don't kill us!

196
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,709
Be quiet!

197
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,135
Take one step closer,
and we'll kill them all!

198
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,099
If they open fire, we respond!

199
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,227
We won't back down to capitalist pigs!

200
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,231
Our plan is as follows.

201
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,443
First, Team A will puncture the wheels.

202
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,029
Then lower the rear airstairs--

203
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,655
Hold on. Isn't that the front?

204
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,700
Is it the front?

205
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,335
Oh, it is!

206
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,463
This looks more like a sausage with wings!

207
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,884
Who the hell drew this?

208
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,637
Who the hell drew this?

209
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,430
-Step forward!
-That's enough.

210
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,307
Estimated casualties?

211
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,727
I'd say anywhere from five

212
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,272
to a hundred, give or take.

213
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,610
That range is too wide.

214
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,903
Everyone.

215
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:48,202
Why are there armed riot police units
on the runway?

216
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:53,123
Not a single life will be lost
on my aircraft.

217
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,375
Mr. Chairman.

218
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,754
While I admire your noble spirit
to put people's lives first,

219
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,590
some sacrifice is inevitable
in order to wipe out

220
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,008
the anti-state communist forces.

221
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,011
"Some sacrifice"?

222
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,430
-You.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,475
What is our airline's slogan?

224
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,271
"As safe as a house in the sky," sir.

225
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,940
Sometimes,

226
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,401
people do die at home…

227
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,405
You little bastard!

228
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,368
And if they do,
house prices drop, don't they?

229
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,581
If our revenue drops,
will the JSDF take responsibility for it?

230
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,168
Or will the government
take responsibility?

231
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,171
Have all forces stand down immediately
and refuel the plane.

232
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,924
Or else we'll detonate the bomb
and blow everyone up!

233
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,428
This airport is under the jurisdiction
of the US Armed Forces,

234
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,221
so refueling will take some time.

235
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,807
Let the passengers go first,

236
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,601
and we'll talk to the US military.

237
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,394
I'll give you one hour.

238
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,937
We, the Red Army Faction,

239
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,941
are not afraid to make sacrifices
for a successful revolution! We are…

240
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,485
Ashita no Joe.

241
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,864
Ashita no Joe?

242
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,325
What on earth is that?

243
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,201
Isn't it a manga series?

244
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,455
Yes, sir. It was published in 1968

245
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,249
and written by Asao Takamori
and Tetsuya Chiba.

246
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,544
The main character is a boxer
named Joe Yabuki.

247
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,880
A famous quote from the series is,

248
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,508
"Even if it's for a moment,
I'll burn, blindingly bright and red."

249
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,594
"Then in the end,

250
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,347
all that will remain
is a pile of white ashes."

251
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,019
Just how old are those damn Reds?

252
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,826
Firstly, I would like to apologize.

253
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,413
If this bomb does go off,

254
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,123
it won't be seen as our doing

255
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,670
but as a massacre by capitalist Japan
who forced our hand.

256
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,341
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,551
Wait a second.

258
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,430
Is that coming towards us?

259
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,528
What are they doing?

260
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,574
I'm sure the government

261
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,995
knows what they're doing.

262
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,871
What is that?

263
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,040
Why's there a fighter jet approaching now?

264
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,251
Get them on the radio immediately!

265
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,425
Who the heck authorized this?

266
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,218
It wasn't me, sir.

267
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,178
I gave the order, sir!

268
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,304
What?

269
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,600
As a member of the Self-Defense Forces,
I can't just stand by and watch!

270
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,812
What are you going to do
if it results in casualties?

271
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,027
That won't happen, sir.

272
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,950
What's happening?

273
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,485
What is he going to do?

274
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,322
It looks like
he's just getting off the plane.

275
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,040
Did he just…

276
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,502
double park the plane and run?

277
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,838
Do you know how annoying it is

278
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,509
when someone parks in front of you
and runs off when you're in a rush?

279
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,971
Move that fighter jet right now,
or I'll blow a head off every ten minutes!

280
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,061
Don't look at them like they're pathetic.

281
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,022
We weren't much different back then.

282
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,650
KOREAN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

283
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,277
No. Unless His Excellency
directly orders it…

284
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,695
CHIEF OF STAFF, ROK AIR FORCE

285
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,156
…the Air Force will follow
proper protocol.

286
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,368
Chief of Staff Choi!

287
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,665
Why is he suddenly being so uncooperative?

288
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,876
I heard the Air Force is siding with Kim,
the president's chief of staff.

289
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,128
Looks like it's true.

290
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,601
Now, what pressing national issue
brought all of you gentlemen together?

291
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,228
Who is that?

292
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,772
I'm a nobody, so you can
just call me Nobody.

293
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,232
Hey, Nobody.

294
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,402
-How have you been?
-Doing well, thanks.

295
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,280
You've been briefed, yes?

296
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,657
What do you think?

297
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,202
Japs kidnapping a bunch of other Japs
to go to North Korea? Just say "sayonara."

298
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,997
“Japs”? Watch your mouth!

299
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh, excuse my potty mouth.

300
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,500
You see, during colonial rule,

301
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,796
my grandpa used to live two houses over
from an independence activist.

302
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,885
Didn't you say that your grandpa
ratted him out to the Japanese police?

303
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,637
Come on, that's a painful part
of my family history.

304
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,975
Anyway, Japan, North Korea…
other countries' problems, not ours.

305
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,770
There are no borders
when it comes to people's lives.

306
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,480
This is about human rights.

307
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,401
Human rights from the KCIA?
Well, that's new.

308
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,285
So wait, is this from the top?

309
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,788
His Excellency has important duties
to attend to today.

310
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,542
I'll be briefing him on it later
like a surprise gift.

311
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,008
Anyway, I received some intel
from the US CIA.

312
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,303
The situation doesn't look good here, sir.

313
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,472
If Japan fucks up,

314
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,893
it is possible that the aircraft
will pass through South Korean airspace.

315
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,854
Requesting immediate notification
up the chain, sir.

316
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,232
I can see where the US is coming from.

317
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,943
If they want to keep the Soviets in check,

318
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,612
they'd want us to be chummy with Japan.

319
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,991
But what is Japan doing right now?

320
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,871
The fighter jet that blocked Haru
on the runway is being pulled out.

321
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,082
Fighter jets can't reverse

322
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,210
so they're towing it out with a truck.

323
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:58,548
So we're fixing this mess
to rub the Japs' faces in it

324
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,719
and kiss the Yankees' asses?

325
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,346
Who the heck is this guy?

326
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,017
Yes, what is it?

327
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:16,525
How many times do I have to tell you?
Those men have to be Reds!

328
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,402
What? Evidence?

329
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,448
Give me two weeks.

330
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,659
All right.

331
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,660
Goodness.

332
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,203
So here's the thing.

333
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,665
Once they go over to North Korea
with the airplane and passengers,

334
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,585
they'll use them to negotiate with Japan.

335
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,629
But!

336
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,550
Think about what will happen
if they ask for economic aid.

337
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,637
Then the GDP of the Reds in the North

338
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,764
will grow and surpass ours.

339
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,101
Just hearing that
makes my blood sugar drop.

340
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,645
But what if…

341
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,775
we take matters into our own hands
and fix this mess for them?

342
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,694
If we do,

343
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,698
then Japan will owe us a big favor!

344
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,785
And we can wave our flag proudly
on the global stage.

345
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,209
It's sure to please His Excellency.

346
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,296
And the Blue House Chief of Staff
will be green with envy.

347
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,384
All right, to sum up…

348
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,804
If Japan fails, as we predicted,

349
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:33,268
the lunatics, armed with explosives,
head to North Korea with 130 hostages.

350
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,189
And our mission
is to appease those lunatics,

351
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,400
who will be floating in the air.

352
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,113
How do you propose we do that?

353
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,115
By talking to them?

354
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,536
Thank you for your valuable input.

355
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,456
The fact of the matter is, sir,
it simply cannot be done.

356
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,383
We'll have a moment, if you please.

357
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,809
Come on, brother.

358
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,561
It really can't be done?

359
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:24,069
If I tell you I want to walk on water,
your job is to freeze that water solid.

360
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,905
I mean,

361
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,534
it's not like I'm a magician.

362
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,661
But if you do work some magic,

363
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,874
I could do what my dad couldn't do
and make your wish come true.

364
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,423
Go on,

365
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,258
pull a dove out of your hat for me.

366
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,598
I thought you might
get angry if you heard it…

367
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,475
What? No way.

368
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,104
I have no anger in me.

369
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,065
Go ahead and tell me.

370
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,280
You idiot!

371
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,074
Are you trying to get me killed?

372
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,410
That's unacceptable. That just isn't okay.

373
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,703
How could you…

374
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,999
Shut up!

375
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,375
Put your gun away!

376
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,836
You're scaring the baby!

377
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,756
Sir!

378
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,966
-Are you all right?
-Shut up!

379
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,843
-What is it over there?
-Stewardess!

380
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,429
-Come over here! Quick!
-What is it? Huh?

381
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,889
I…

382
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,183
I have a heart condition.

383
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,352
You should've mentioned that
before you got kidnapped!

384
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,562
Pardon?

385
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,065
Untie him right now!

386
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,861
Is there a doctor on board?

387
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,613
-Any doctors?
-Is there--

388
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,697
I'm…

389
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,407
a doctor!

390
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,367
A medical emergency has occurred on board.

391
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,369
Please start refueling the plane.

392
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,247
We are still in discussion
with the US Armed Forces.

393
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,666
Wait a few more minutes.

394
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,294
Please hurry…

395
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,712
If the passenger dies,

396
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,256
just know that
it's all the government's fault!

397
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,467
Hey!

398
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,387
-Fuck.
-Hello?

399
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,514
Hey!

400
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,267
Tell them that you'll free the sick
and elderly in exchange for fuel.

401
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,312
I'm sure you don't want
to see anyone die either.

402
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,567
We won't be making any deals
with capitalist pigs.

403
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,445
If anything happens
to a passenger on board,

404
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,113
then you will be giving

405
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,618
those capitalist pigs
an excuse to charge in here.

406
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,580
It's a yes from me.

407
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,751
We'll still have enough hostages
even without the sick and elderly.

408
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,218
It's five to three.

409
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,678
We should hurry and let them--

410
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,346
It's a no from me.

411
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,306
One compromise will open the floodgates.

412
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,693
Four to four.

413
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,283
Actually, I've changed my mind.

414
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,200
What?

415
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,911
We have to stand our ground
until we reach Pyongyang!

416
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,955
That's five to three. No one gets off!

417
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,914
No.

418
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,920
Communism calls for a unanimous decision.

419
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:33,008
We don't follow things like majority rule.

420
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,056
Wait, Leader.
Then why did you call for a vote--

421
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,308
Shut up!

422
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,726
The leader makes the call.

423
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:44,853
Right?

424
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,815
Of course.

425
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,360
Dictatorship in communism is inevitable.

426
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,405
Japanese Ride Flight 351

427
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,241
has finally begun refueling
after a four-hour standoff.

428
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,995
With much effort and persistent persuasion
from government authorities,

429
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,913
23 passengers were released,

430
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,999
including a patient
with a heart condition,

431
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,169
the elderly, women and children.

432
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,046
My son is still on board!

433
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,631
The Japanese Self-Defense Forces

434
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,217
prioritized the passengers'
lives and safety above all.

435
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,764
We worked tirelessly
to safely rescue the passengers

436
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,515
according to proper protocol.

437
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,892
Hurry up. Close the door!

438
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,688
However, it seems that
the remaining 106 passengers

439
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,983
will be departing Itazuke Airport soon.

440
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,487
Are you kidding me?

441
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,864
I'm supposed to go to Pyongyang with this?

442
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,369
Is there a problem?

443
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,082
Aeronautical charts must have
flight routes and airport information.

444
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,627
They clearly ripped this
out of a middle-school textbook.

445
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,172
I wish you the best of luck.

446
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,008
Hold on. Wait a second.

447
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,760
Hey! Stop right there!

448
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,803
Hey!

449
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,262
Hey!

450
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,101
Do you still think
this government has a plan?

451
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,603
But why would they…

452
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:13,024
They can't send us to North Korea
but they can't stop us from going either.

453
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,653
So they're leaving us
to fend for ourselves.

454
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,157
Despite everything,

455
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,618
we did our best.

456
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,914
"Our best"?

457
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,333
What did we even do?

458
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,795
All we did was double park
and piss them off!

459
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,550
You all just stood there
and stared like idiots!

460
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,969
Why is nobody furious about this?

461
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,095
Excuse us!

462
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,107
CHAPTER 2
DOUBLE HIJACKING

463
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,817
Since the armistice,

464
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,903
we've lost four US fighter jets
in North Korean airspace

465
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,322
and incurred dozens of casualties.

466
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,992
But last year, there was a team
that made it back safely,

467
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,202
surviving an attack by North Korean MiGs.

468
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,205
And the pilot who completed
the mission received a medal.

469
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,123
But…

470
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,043
why does only the pilot
receive the medal?

471
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,380
Ask the person handing them out, not me.

472
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,798
Well, look at you!

473
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,884
You've got some sass, huh?

474
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:25,096
You were the only Korean
in that mission, weren't you?

475
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,931
As an assistant controller.

476
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,353
Per the rule,
the lead controller of RAPCON

477
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,314
should be from the US military.

478
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,316
I see. By the way,

479
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,777
I heard that the number of people

480
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,821
who passed the RAPCON assessment
in Korea

481
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,283
can be counted on one hand.

482
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,701
Isn't that right?

483
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,128
I'm probably the first finger
on that hand.

484
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,967
Impressive.

485
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,054
What exactly is RAPCON, anyway?

486
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,389
RAPCON, or Radar Approach Control.

487
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,602
State-of-the-art radar control system
held by the US since 1968.

488
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,104
It's controlled
by a US 5th Air Force battalion

489
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,106
and can detect
up to 30,000 ft. in the air--

490
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,024
Enough.

491
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,692
It's boring.

492
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,612
In the end, you're just an assistant.

493
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,576
And who exactly are you?

494
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,789
I'm a nobody, just a shit-ass nobody.

495
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,625
You can just call me Nobody.

496
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,966
Am I understanding this correctly?

497
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,511
This so-called Red Army Faction
hijacked the plane,

498
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,598
so we're going to hijack
the airplane's radio.

499
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,892
Isn't it fucking genius?

500
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,727
I think so too.

501
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,857
You have no idea
how this system works, do you?

502
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,694
The controllers can't initiate
communication with the pilots.

503
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,696
But you're going to make it happen.

504
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,739
Since you know the system so well.

505
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,033
Let's say we get in contact with them.

506
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,911
How will we persuade them?

507
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,872
By talking to them?

508
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,128
What a genius.

509
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,713
Cut me some slack.

510
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,383
I had no time to prep, either.

511
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,844
"By failing to prepare,

512
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,430
you are preparing to fail."

513
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,099
Benjamin Franklin.

514
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,896
Yet another bastard
who's obsessed with quotes and shit.

515
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,983
There's value in the words
of those remembered by history.

516
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,282
KIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

517
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,706
You speak Japanese, too, right?

518
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,461
If this goes well,
I'll make your wish come true.

519
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,047
Are you a mind reader?

520
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,050
What do you think my wish is?

521
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,678
Success.

522
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,018
How shallow do you think I am?

523
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,773
Your name means "making yourself known"?

524
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,233
It's even in your fucking name.

525
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,818
Excuse you, my father named me.

526
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,195
Your father…

527
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,907
Wasn't he a Korean War vet?

528
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,493
WHITE HORSE HILL, 20 YEARS AGO

529
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,162
The grenade went off at White Horse Hill.

530
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,624
Have you ever seen
the puppet army's limbs fly?

531
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,962
I was watching the spectacle in awe…

532
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,675
when I realized that my legs flew off too.

533
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,515
The person…

534
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,144
who threw the grenade,
my lieutenant colonel,

535
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,564
received
the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit.

536
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,859
Meanwhile…

537
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,030
instead of two legs…

538
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,121
your dad received this watch
from the president.

539
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,999
Look. It's pretty nice, isn't it?

540
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,586
If we pull this off,

541
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,840
will the government
give me a medal or something?

542
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:33,052
But of course!
You'll be living up to your name.

543
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,182
Lieutenant Seo, who are these people?

544
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,559
Just wait a sec.

545
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,519
I'm about to walk them through
the procedure.

546
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:47,025
As RAPCON is under US command,
even ministers need to receive clearance.

547
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,361
Give me your ID,
and I'll get the process started.

548
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,281
Tell him I really need
to use the restroom.

549
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,742
This isn't some neighborhood café.

550
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,326
Just interpret already.

551
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,502
This guy has to pee badly
and wants to use our restroom.

552
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,427
What the fuck was that?

553
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,637
That's the code?

554
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,767
So I get you're working
for the government,

555
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,269
but what do you do, exactly?

556
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,812
I told you, I'm just a nobody.

557
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,022
That makes no sense.

558
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,108
This is something
that could make the news.

559
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,328
My work does appear on the news,
but I never do.

560
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,872
So no need to know anything about me.

561
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,249
Come on, there's no time to waste.

562
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,857
-Sir!
-Sir!

563
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,945
All right, the board's been set,

564
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,738
so let's go!

565
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,537
You are not serious, are you?

566
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,334
You want me to be the…
the local controller?

567
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,878
-All we can do…
-Now…

568
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:35,258
How does it feel to have control
of South Korean airspace?

569
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,635
Are you saying

570
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,263
the US military is giving us
operational control?

571
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,557
How does that even make sense?

572
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,144
They're the ones who recommended you.

573
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,443
This is clearly an unbelievable privilege.

574
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,904
Which means the medal and promotion
aren't a bluff.

575
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,366
It's a great opportunity
to make my mark in the world.

576
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,493
But why?

577
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,786
Why me, of all people?

578
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,204
Quiet!

579
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,582
I can hear your cogs whirring.
Just sit down.

580
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,251
Everyone's in a mad rush right now.

581
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,921
They left Itazuke 35 minutes ago
and are headed north over the East Sea.

582
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,089
NORTH KOREA AIR FORCE HQ

583
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,092
They're going to come straight
over South Korea?

584
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,304
They sure are gutsy!

585
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,186
They just have to make it over
the Demarcation Line.

586
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,981
Then we'll have a Boeing 727
in our hands without breaking a sweat.

587
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,861
On top of that, we'll have
about 100 lives to use for negotiation!

588
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,489
Our Soviet comrades
will regard us highly for this.

589
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,911
Get our most proficient
air traffic controller on the job!

590
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,791
-He's the one who will carry out the plan.
-I see.

591
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,070
In terms of range, RAPCON
covers a maximum radius of 40 miles.

592
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,240
They have to radio us at least
in Kyonggi for us to track it.

593
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,994
It's hard to intercept
transmissions to Pyongyang.

594
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,538
Hey!

595
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,750
40 miles, really?

596
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,548
-Control, Range.
-Go ahead, Range.

597
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,842
Permission to change
the controlling range.

598
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,387
The control license number is…

599
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,307
My license?

600
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,560
You're fucking out of your mind.

601
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,398
Going over 40 miles in range is
a violation of international aviation law.

602
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,819
Are you trying to turn me
into an international criminal?

603
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,030
Go ahead, Range.
Give us the control license.

604
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,533
For fuck's sake.

605
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,370
So this is why I'm sitting here?

606
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,373
Major Hall.

607
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,501
We, the United States of America,

608
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,088
as the defenders of liberal democracy
around the world,

609
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:24,635
firmly declare that we can never allow
the displacement of innocent civilians

610
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,887
to a communist dictatorship.

611
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,723
I agree, sir.

612
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,100
So we command this operation?

613
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,268
Major Hall.

614
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,688
We, the United States of America,

615
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,524
as the guardians of the rule of law,

616
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,610
firmly declare that we can never violate

617
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,363
any international aviation law.

618
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,533
What the f…

619
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,453
I can't do this. No, I will not do it.

620
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,622
Sit.

621
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,876
License number.

622
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,171
8-2-9-0-7…

623
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,882
1-4.

624
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,009
Copy that.
We'll extend the controlling range

625
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,802
to the maximum of 200 miles.

626
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,930
Look! There's more stuff now.

627
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,557
But how do we find "it"?

628
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,936
What do you think you're doing?

629
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,190
You guys all saw that, right?

630
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,858
I didn't say it. This guy did it!

631
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,778
Lieutenant Go-myung.

632
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,821
Don't you want a medal?

633
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,908
Not even a statue in my honor.
Cancel it immediately!

634
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,663
More than 100 people
are being dragged off to North Korea.

635
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,626
As a soldier and a controller,
don't you want to save those poor people?

636
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,878
Damn it.

637
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,713
-Go and sit back down!
-Shoot!

638
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,509
I'm a soldier of the ROK Armed Forces,

639
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,095
and I have not received
any official orders yet.

640
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,431
Aren't all of you soldiers like me?

641
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,558
This bastard's aiming a gun
at a ROK soldier.

642
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,361
Have you eaten yet?

643
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:11,534
No, I've been too busy to eat.
I'm starving. Yeah.

644
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,704
Well, I got him in front of the panel,

645
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,499
but he said something about aviation law.

646
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,252
I don't know, but it's complicated.
My head hurts.

647
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,879
Right. Sure.

648
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,340
Take it.

649
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,011
-Who is it?
-Hello.

650
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,432
I'm Park Sang-hyeon,
the director of the KCIA.

651
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,312
And who might you be?

652
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,689
Yes, sir.

653
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,277
COMSEC. I'm Lieutenant Seo Go-myung
of the 9th ACSG.

654
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,736
Please proceed, sir.

655
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,780
The Korean Central Intelligence Agency.

656
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,491
Two things came to mind
the moment I heard that name.

657
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,285
The moment I refuse…

658
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,791
Commie, commie, red rat!

659
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,336
…I'll be branded a Red
and live the rest of my life as a cripple.

660
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,588
You little brats!

661
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,802
Or be a snippet of news as a soldier
killed in a training accident.

662
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,974
I don't know aviation law
or anything like that.

663
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,227
Just do whatever it takes

664
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,564
to land that plane nice and smoothly.

665
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,776
Did you say,
"Just do whatever it takes," sir?

666
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,361
Yes.

667
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,697
Do whatever it takes.

668
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,997
Then…

669
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,293
Then…

670
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,255
May I say this is North Korea?

671
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,509
You bastard!

672
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,970
And you call yourself a soldier
of the ROK Armed Forces, you asshole?

673
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,309
You know you can be punished immediately
for what you just said, right?

674
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,320
Put Nobody on the phone.

675
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:15,950
See? I told you
that this was the only way.

676
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,410
Yes, okay.

677
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,663
Oh, yes. Yes, sure.

678
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,707
Oh, sure. Yes. Yes.

679
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:29,338
So then, the KCIA is authorizing it?

680
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,640
Why are you standing there
like you have a stick up your ass?

681
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,849
Aren't you going to work?

682
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,435
Are you…

683
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,189
Are you sure this is a good idea?

684
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,775
Who gives a damn?

685
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,946
If it all goes south,
we'll be eating our own words.

686
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,492
Hey, soldiers, what are you waiting for?

687
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,660
Follow me.

688
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,209
Move it! We're running out of time!

689
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,377
Yes, sir!

690
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,927
Fuck.

691
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,971
Where the heck are you?

692
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,225
Thank you for your patience
and compliance.

693
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,478
We are approaching Pyongyang,
so please bear with us a little bit more.

694
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,148
As soon as we reach Pyongyang,

695
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:34,111
we'll request that North Korea
returns all of you home safely.

696
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,449
If you need to use the restroom,
please use it now.

697
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,371
After the meal is over,
we'll be collecting all cigarettes.

698
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,626
The collected cigarettes will be
shared equally among us over time.

699
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,877
Hold on.

700
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,757
I had three packs of Marlboro,
but he barely has a whole pack.

701
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,468
Isn't it unfair to divvy them up equally?

702
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:02,181
It's because of people like you that
we're trying to bring about a revolution.

703
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,017
You keep talking about revolution.

704
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,895
May I ask what
the goal of your revolution is?

705
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,937
LONG LIVE LENINISM

706
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,940
"Capitalism that only chases success

707
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,193
will inevitably lead
to discrimination and submission

708
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,153
and breed classism."

709
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,448
We plan to overthrow
such established order

710
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,076
and bring peace to the world.

711
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,579
I heard them refer to you as the leader.

712
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,749
But I guess
that doesn't count as classism.

713
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,750
What?

714
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,418
Anyway.

715
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,214
You hijacked a plane, and now you plan
to organize an army in the name of peace?

716
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,967
Peace doesn't necessarily
require peaceful means.

717
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,427
Wow.

718
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,971
That's some impressive logic.

719
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,225
That almost persuaded me.

720
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,821
Friendly 5-1-1, 0-9-5.

721
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,030
I found it!

722
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,034
What was the previous track?

723
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,245
Friendly 510 was at 105,

724
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,663
-108 miles--
-Okay!

725
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,998
If we tracked them here and then here,

726
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,292
that kind of speed
only comes from a fighter jet.

727
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,295
Then that means
the Unknown 472 in front of them

728
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,881
is the plane we're looking for!

729
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,217
Oh! I get… What?

730
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,677
-What?
-What?

731
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,097
An unidentified aircraft invaded
our airspace illegally,

732
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,392
so naturally, according to protocol,
we scrambled our fighter jets.

733
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,772
But we shouldn't scramble
according to protocol.

734
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,154
Does the Air Force
not know about this operation?

735
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,196
Mr. Kim, sir.

736
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,157
CHIEF OF STAFF, ROK AIR FORCE
FROM EARLIER

737
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,658
Unless His Excellency directly orders it…

738
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,370
Per protocol,
two fighter jets have been scrambled.

739
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,207
They should've caught up
with it by now!

740
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,417
Well done.

741
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,378
You did an amazing job.
You did great.

742
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,464
RESIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
CHIEF OF STAFF

743
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:03,552
Having the head
of the ROK Air Force on my side

744
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,306
is so reassuring, let me tell you.

745
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,852
If I could be of any help to you,
I'll do all I can--

746
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,020
"Splitting move."

747
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,189
Oh, fuck!

748
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,985
What's wrong, sir? Did I make a mistake?

749
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,528
No, not at all.

750
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,574
Anyway,
make their balls crawl back inside them

751
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,744
and force them to land
at the nearest runway.

752
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,706
What if they refuse to comply?

753
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,668
Then what should we do?

754
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,296
"Push and crush"!

755
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,798
"Push and crush"…

756
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,510
Are you saying we should shoot it down?

757
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,602
What is that?

758
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,439
What is that?

759
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,569
-It's a South Korean fighter jet.
-South Korea?

760
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,615
We must have veered off course.
Connect to the emergency frequency.

761
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,330
This is the Korean Air Force.

762
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,499
You made an intrusion in Korean airspace.

763
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,586
State your call sign and destination.

764
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,839
Japanese Ride 351.

765
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,758
We are an unarmed
Japanese civilian aircraft.

766
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,261
This is not our destination here.

767
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,555
We are heading to Pyongyang Airport.

768
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,307
You are intercepted by Korean Air Force.

769
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,643
Descend and maintain 9,000.

770
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,937
What are they saying?

771
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,065
Follow me.

772
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,486
I say again,

773
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,656
you are intercepted by Korean Air Force.

774
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,243
We don't allow you to go to Pyongyang.

775
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,161
We don't allow you to go to Pyongyang.

776
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,456
I say again,
we don't allow you to go to Pyongyang.

777
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,708
Follow--

778
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,834
What are you doing?

779
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,669
What if we get shot down?

780
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,380
If we can't set foot in Pyongyang,

781
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,174
then dying in the sky isn't too bad.

782
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,472
They've pulled back!

783
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,557
But wait…

784
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,225
They're in attack position.

785
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,852
-Call the Osan base right now!
-Yes, sir!

786
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,147
-No, no. Hey, Dopey.
-Sir?

787
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,148
Go sit back down.

788
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,817
-I--
-What do you think you're doing?

789
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,777
This is a secret operation by the KCIA.

790
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,362
Secret operation, my ass.

791
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,822
What if there are casualties?

792
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,700
Isn't this a rescue mission?

793
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,596
Everyone, take your seats and buckle up!

794
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,349
-Prepare for Plan B.
-Damn it!

795
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:13,909
Come on.

796
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,080
What are you doing?

797
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,958
What was that… just now?

798
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,669
I think it was a flock of geese.

799
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,588
Lieutenant Go-myung.

800
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,048
Don't get ahead of yourself.

801
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,134
Attacking a Japanese commercial flight
is a declaration of war.

802
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,095
What lunatic would do such a thing?

803
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,304
What?

804
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,889
They didn't respond?

805
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:40,519
Those Reds are so rude,
no matter what nationality they are.

806
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,106
If they refuse to land
before the Demarcation Line,

807
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,108
then just turn back.

808
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,609
"Cross"!

809
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:00,998
Yes!

810
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,624
They've turned back!

811
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:33,780
Wait a second.

812
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,787
If the Korean fighter jets
have turned back…

813
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,832
It just crossed the MDL
and entered our airspace.

814
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,292
All right, comrades!

815
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,419
Our internationalist
revolutionary warriors

816
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,546
are flying straight
into the Republic's arms!

817
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,090
Open the emergency frequency.

818
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,342
Now what?

819
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,763
You said we can't
initiate communication from here.

820
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:02,059
That's why Lieutenant Seo
opened the emergency frequency.

821
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:06,063
When they try to radio again,
we'll intercept their transmission.

822
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,106
But wait, what if they--

823
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,656
What if they're
already talking to Pyongyang?

824
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,033
You said they're headed straight to them.

825
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,869
They probably won't know
Pyongyang's frequency.

826
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,537
How the heck would you know?

827
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,915
If they were under Pyongyang's control,

828
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,376
they wouldn't have dared
to go through South Korea like that.

829
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,171
They will end up using
the emergency frequency.

830
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,966
The problem is that the emergency
frequency of 121.5 MHz is used worldwide,

831
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,593
so anyone can listen in.

832
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,386
Including Pyongyang.

833
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:43,391
So the call won't come directly to us
but to an emergency contact? Is that it?

834
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,604
Then are the South Koreans
listening in as well?

835
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,441
Cat got your tongue? Answer us!

836
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,904
My head's about to explode
from all the noise.

837
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,365
Keep it down, all of you.

838
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,866
You little ass--

839
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,619
Without talking to a control tower,

840
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,746
we might get swept away
or crash into a mountain.

841
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,665
You said this frequency
was open to everyone.

842
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,584
What if someone else listens in?

843
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,504
Do you want to be aimlessly
flying in the sky forever?

844
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:21,471
The elite controller face-off
between North and South Korea

845
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,433
is simpler than it seems.

846
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,351
No.

847
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,353
It's not simple at all.

848
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:32,524
This duel demands
extreme focus and speed.

849
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,652
Amid the countless transmissions,
we have to locate Haru's call

850
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:41,366
and press this red button
even just 0.0000000001 second faster.

851
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:45,078
That's how you win
this solitary and nerve-wracking battle.

852
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,456
So, to summarize,

853
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,713
the person with the fastest hand wins.

854
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,090
If I had to give an example…

855
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,303
Like Clint Eastwood
in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

856
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,402
Is it connected?

857
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,364
Listening. Go ahead.

858
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,463
Wildfire extinguished!
Wildfire extinguished!

859
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,090
Returning to headquarters.

860
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,804
All firefighting helicopters,

861
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,474
please refrain from using
the emergency frequency from now on.

862
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,017
Oh, come on, man!

863
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,895
We've always used it.
So let's keep it that way.

864
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,523
The emergency frequency
is for emergencies only!

865
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,359
Firefighting helicopters
are supposed to put out fires!

866
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,028
That's not an emergency, you bastard!

867
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,364
What a fool.

868
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:48,326
That dumb South Korean controller

869
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,621
is fighting with a firefighting
helicopter pilot right now.

870
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,084
We'd expect nothing less
from a US imperialist pawn.

871
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,380
Shouldn't they have reached out by now?

872
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,574
Any station. This is Japanese Ride 351.

873
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,492
This is Japanese Ride 351.

874
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,329
We're asking for
Pyongyang approach control.

875
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,416
Japanese Ride 351.

876
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,168
Japanese Ride 351.

877
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,836
-This is Pyongyang approach control.
-…Pyongyang.

878
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,796
South Korea might listen to this.

879
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,215
Your radio is very weak
and garbled on this frequency.

880
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,967
-Go to…
-Change frequency to…

881
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:46,926
…134.1.

882
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,303
129.7.

883
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,013
And follow my instructions.

884
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,904
This is Japanese Ride 351.

885
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,531
Frequency…

886
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,742
134.1.

887
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,997
Frequency 134.1.

888
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,585
Over.

889
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,557
This is Japanese Ride 351.

890
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,144
Now on your frequency, 134.1.

891
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,690
Japanese Ride 351.

892
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,317
Radar contact.

893
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,655
Fly heading 290 and maintain 9,000 ft.

894
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,410
Fire surface-to-air missiles immediately
and draw them back!

895
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,829
Do not shoot them down!
Just send a signal. Understood?

896
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,747
Fire!

897
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,001
What…

898
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,212
is going on now?

899
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,685
Explosive noise and light
detected on our route.

900
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,566
This is for you guys, comrades.

901
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,652
Welcome to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

902
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,115
I see…

903
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:36,077
So this is a cannon salute?

904
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,142
Leader.

905
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:04,856
Even North Korea's welcome
is revolutionary, isn't it?

906
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,735
Yes.

907
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,875
Congrats to you too, Captain.

908
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,544
You hit 10,000 flight hours.

909
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,882
I think my hemorrhoids
are peeking out more.

910
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,899
Lieutenant Seo!
The world's greatest hijacker!

911
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,485
To double hijack a plane
without setting foot in it?

912
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,238
That's damn good, right?

913
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,574
You saved a lot of lives, man.

914
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,493
Yup. Thank you, sir.

915
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,246
And you can get yourself
fucking cheeseburgers

916
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,914
with the price of their lives.

917
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,044
All right. Captain, stand by.

918
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:17,095
Hey, can you stall for as long as you can
until they arrive at Kimpo?

919
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,516
The mission succeeded.
You could at least give me some praise.

920
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,435
Don't you know that quote?
"Success is not final."

921
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,645
Winston Churchill.

922
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,188
Right.

923
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,439
Keep up the good work.

924
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,109
Where do you keep disappearing to?

925
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,069
What does it matter to you?

926
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,905
If you don't see me, it means I'm working.

927
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,499
CHAPTER 3
SANDCASTLE

928
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,668
What about the US aircraft
on the runway?

929
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,045
It's a nightmare trying
to get them all to take off,

930
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,423
so we're trying to hide them away
as best we can.

931
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,050
I don't think hiding them will do.

932
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,431
Look at that. Are you going
to take your sweet time moving those?

933
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:05,143
This isn't like parking cars, sir!

934
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,311
Hey, mister!

935
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,772
You can't just pull the flag down
like that! It's all tangled!

936
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,984
Is the North Korean flag
really on its way?

937
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,862
Where do you even get hold
of a thing like that?

938
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,160
Cut! Cut!

939
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:25,079
You call that acting?

940
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,874
That wasn't realistic at all!

941
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,834
-You can't just shoot--
-Sir! Sir!

942
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,337
Someone wants to see you.

943
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,342
Who the hell is ordering
the director around on set?

944
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:38,926
Come out!

945
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:43,848
There we go!

946
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,977
Now, this is what I call realistic!
You know?

947
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,981
But weren't we filming
the Korean Army scene tomorrow?

948
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,234
I'm sure it's realistic
because they're real soldiers.

949
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:14,253
-Thank you for coming, director.
-You must be the planner!

950
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,048
-Yes.
-You know, as an artist,

951
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,801
I'm so honored by this opportunity
to serve my country!

952
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,344
PYONGYANG SUNAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

953
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,596
Wow, they are tossing someone
in the air!

954
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,933
Hooray for Park Sang-hyeon!

955
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,560
Hooray for the Republic of Korea!

956
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,854
Hooray for Park Sang-hyeon!

957
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,232
Hooray for the Republic of Korea!

958
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,866
-Gosh, my back.
-Look who it is!

959
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,536
The defeated troop is making an entrance.

960
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,501
-You pulled off a big one, Park.
-I did.

961
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,545
His Excellency will be pleased.

962
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:03,219
But is it really okay to pretend
this is North Korea?

963
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:08,474
Isn't saving lives more important
than ideology, brother?

964
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,686
Seo Go-myung.

965
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,522
Man, what a name!

966
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:19,277
It's been so long since I've seen
such a reliable young man.

967
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,362
I'm so proud and happy!

968
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:27,535
So I heard that your father
fought in the Korean War.

969
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,453
Yes, sir!

970
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:35,793
He lost both legs
in the Reds' grenade attack, didn't he?

971
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,799
No, sir. It was our own grenade.

972
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,181
Such is the tragedy of war.
Sacrifice always follows.

973
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,767
-But he was always proud, sir!
-Is that right?

974
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,643
And he's about to get prouder now.

975
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,397
His son's about to get decorated
with a medal and everything.

976
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,400
-You may resume your duties.
-Yes, sir!

977
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,403
Minister.

978
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,699
Why don't we put him right in front?

979
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,367
It's the perfect picture!

980
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,497
Two generations of national heroes.

981
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:18,669
All right, you have 30 seconds
to change and gather outside!

982
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,006
Wait, these ladies are too refined.

983
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,176
This is how you keep it realistic.

984
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,469
You know how they say,

985
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,430
"Handsome men in the South,
beautiful ladies in the North."

986
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,140
-Can't remember.
-What?

987
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,726
Why are you wearing
the puppet army's uniform?

988
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,729
I used to be an actor!

989
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,857
If I can't capture this moment on film,

990
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,276
I want to at least be a part of it!

991
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,279
It's only realistic
if people believe it to be so.

992
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,323
But will they believe you're a soldier?

993
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,870
Are you saying that

994
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,039
because I'm fat?

995
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,707
-Assistant Director.
-Yes, sir.

996
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,460
Isn't this social discrimination
and prejudice?

997
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,630
Of course! In this day and age?
You can't say things like that.

998
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:06,425
I was just saying! Since you're a soldier…

999
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,929
Never mind. Go ahead.

1000
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,765
You're right. Some soldier I am.

1001
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,226
Can't see his own dick
because of his pot belly.

1002
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,771
When did I ever say that?
I told you to go ahead!

1003
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,314
This is my character, okay?

1004
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,860
I'm a well-fed officer
from a wealthy family.

1005
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,821
Even Kim Il Sung in the North is a pig!

1006
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,114
-You know?
-Yes, I got it.

1007
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,783
I've filmed eight anti-communist films!

1008
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,369
-Eight! Your outdated--
-Okay! Go ahead!

1009
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,806
Oh, fuck it.

1010
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,144
What does it matter?

1011
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,522
Japanese Ride 351.

1012
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,816
Your position,
80 miles west of the airport.

1013
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,236
Descend and maintain 4,000.
And maintain present heading.

1014
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,074
This is Japanese Ride 351.
Maintain 4,000 and approaching.

1015
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,118
Japanese Ride 351, roger.

1016
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,370
Continue descent to 2,500.

1017
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,581
Cleared ILS runway 14 approach.

1018
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,499
Contact tower 129.1.

1019
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,463
Approaching runway 14.
Control tower, standby.

1020
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,679
Bravo!

1021
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:40,645
Can I trust you to take care of things
until the hostages are off the plane?

1022
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:42,688
Excuse me?

1023
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,609
Sir, RAPCON is under US command,

1024
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:49,528
and landing is controlled
by our control tower.

1025
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,074
The landing controller is already
on standby. I don't know if I should--

1026
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,451
What are you talking about?

1027
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,163
Until the hostages land on Kimpo soil,

1028
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:03,000
Lieutenant Seo should be in control
and put an end to this

1029
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:07,380
so that your heroic arc will be complete.

1030
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,843
When they get off,
we'll take a group photo here

1031
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,221
and get some interviews as well.

1032
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,681
And you get a medal.

1033
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,517
What a great opportunity.

1034
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,668
The hero of Korea,
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung,

1035
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:49,922
is entering Seoul right now
with a million citizens welcoming him.

1036
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,718
You are a hero who saved
the lives of 106 Japanese passengers.

1037
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,261
How does that feel?

1038
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,598
I'm undeserving of the word "hero."

1039
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,768
As a member of the ROK Air Force,

1040
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,729
as an air traffic controller,

1041
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:08,357
I simply did my duty.

1042
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,702
Oh, my stomach hurts.

1043
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,665
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung,
Korea's own hero!

1044
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,626
Why are you taking a dump
after you wash your hands?

1045
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,298
Mr. Park is asking for you.

1046
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,970
My beloved Mr. Park. We are ready to go.

1047
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,097
Okay. Great job.

1048
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,516
Now go greet our guests.

1049
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,518
Me?

1050
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,854
Since when do planners
show up on set?

1051
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,233
Who else knows
North Korea better than you?

1052
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:04,163
Fuck, that ridiculous rumor was true?

1053
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,623
What rumor?

1054
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:08,542
You know you can't pull up
his resident registration number, right?

1055
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:13,047
There are rumors
he was part of the North's puppet army.

1056
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,592
And you know how Mr. Park's father
was a general back then?

1057
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,929
Among the puppet soldiers
they captured during battle,

1058
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,432
there was one that stood out
among others. A genius.

1059
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,351
And that was Nobody?

1060
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,521
Yes! They erased all his records

1061
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,107
and kept him as a fixer
for two generations.

1062
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:32,775
That's ridiculous.

1063
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,778
So you're saying we've been
hunting Reds with a Red?

1064
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,698
Wouldn't Mr. Park just have
given him a new identity instead?

1065
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,451
Then they can't keep him on a leash.

1066
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,621
Look.

1067
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:49,166
He drags him around everywhere
and makes him do all the dirty work.

1068
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:28,330
So you've decided to join us
and witness history in the making.

1069
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,916
I'm so thrilled
that I'm positively shaking.

1070
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,169
It'll go well, won't it?

1071
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:37,339
We managed to slap something together.
Let's just hope it holds.

1072
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,582
This morning,

1073
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:13,626
I didn't think I'd be coming to Pyongyang.

1074
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:17,296
You will all be heading back
to Japan soon.

1075
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,008
Thank goodness
we didn't have to resort to Plan B.

1076
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,177
Plan B?

1077
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,263
All right, the plane is coming in!

1078
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:30,434
Welcome team, shake those pom-poms!
Come on, show me what you've got!

1079
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,937
Cameras! Start rolling!

1080
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,147
Puppet soldiers! In formation!

1081
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,857
All right, ready!

1082
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,528
Action!

1083
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,000
Japanese Ride 351.

1084
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,418
Welcome to Pyongyang.

1085
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,087
You may open the door and get off.

1086
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,685
Why aren't they coming out?

1087
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:38,252
Shut up!

1088
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,767
Comrades of the Revolution! Welcome!

1089
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,352
We've prepared

1090
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,604
a press conference at the airport--

1091
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:03,277
Japanese Ride 351,
do you have any problem?

1092
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,114
Is this really Pyongyang?

1093
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:13,954
Where else would this be?

1094
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:18,751
A comrade saw a US plane
on the runway.

1095
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,169
I clearly saw

1096
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:23,422
"Northwest" on its tail.

1097
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:29,053
Why is there a capitalist plane
in the land of revolution?

1098
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,900
It's a decoy aircraft.

1099
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:48,322
We'll be sending soldiers
of the revolution like you to the US.

1100
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:55,245
You're going to hit the US directly…?

1101
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,876
North Korea's really something else.

1102
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:02,795
Yeah.

1103
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,339
Leader.

1104
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,634
Take a look at this!

1105
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,146
What?

1106
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,315
A Black person?

1107
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,609
He's looking at us

1108
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,237
while eating a burger.

1109
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,617
That idiot.

1110
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,127
It's the Soviet army
stationed in Pyongyang.

1111
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:48,340
Are there Black people
in the Soviet Union?

1112
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,885
I've never heard
of Black people living there.

1113
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:55,305
But I've also never heard
that there weren't any there.

1114
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,475
I think there could be some there.

1115
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,227
It's a huge country, you know.

1116
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,937
Do you think so?

1117
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,857
Look outside.

1118
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,733
It's clearly Pyongyang.

1119
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,027
Hey.

1120
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:12,573
Let me give you a piece of advice.

1121
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,453
You shouldn't believe everything you see.

1122
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,582
I thought my parents loved each other!

1123
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,795
Go find a passenger with a radio.

1124
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,843
Alexander Pushkin was Black too.

1125
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:33,886
Who's that?

1126
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,929
The father of modern Russian literature.

1127
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,724
Come on, that's common knowledge
for a soviet follower.

1128
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,020
Common knowledge…

1129
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,579
Ladies and gentlemen.

1130
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:04,249
I would like to ask you
a general knowledge question.

1131
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,960
As far as I know,

1132
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:11,840
you are currently running
a five-year national economic plan.

1133
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:14,968
Which year are you on now?

1134
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,979
I think you may be mistaken.

1135
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,857
The five-year economic plan,

1136
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,902
which was once in flight
like a winged beast,

1137
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:34,446
ended ten years ago.

1138
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:39,493
Then,

1139
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:44,081
when is the Supreme Leader's birthday?

1140
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:47,167
Our beloved comrade Kim Il Sung--

1141
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,502
No!

1142
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:50,003
Not you.

1143
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,011
You there.

1144
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,307
You! The fat one.

1145
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,895
I'm talking to you, fatso!
Stop looking around!

1146
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,730
Answer me!

1147
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,024
When is the Supreme Leader's birthday?

1148
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:13,860
I…

1149
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,113
do not speak…

1150
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,490
Japanese.

1151
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:23,829
This is…

1152
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,081
This is Pyongyang?

1153
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:27,541
Yes or no?

1154
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,088
Yes.

1155
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:36,550
This is Pyongyang? Yes or no?

1156
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,845
Leader! I found a radio…

1157
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,897
Yes or no?

1158
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:54,484
This is Pyongyang? Yes or no?

1159
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,069
-"Yes or no?"
-Yes or no?

1160
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,738
-Yes!
-Yes or no?

1161
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,991
-Yes!
-Yes or no?

1162
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,122
Louis Armstrong.

1163
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,876
This is American capitalist music!

1164
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,225
Yes or no?

1165
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,604
What the heck is he saying?

1166
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,106
Rock, paper, scissors?

1167
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:37,069
Yes or no?

1168
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:40,739
Yes or no?

1169
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,661
No.

1170
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,924
CHAPTER 4
BAD NEWS

1171
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,260
A Japanese aircraft, hijacked by Reds
and en route to North Korea,

1172
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,513
made an emergency landing
at Kimpo Airport.

1173
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:07,307
It's tough as it is with the North.

1174
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:12,604
And now we even have
Japanese Red b******* here?

1175
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,981
Send them off already to their Red Land!

1176
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:17,818
They're not holding Koreans as hostages.

1177
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:22,823
I'm just scared that our soldiers
might get sacrificed.

1178
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:26,118
I knew this would happen.

1179
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,162
You didn't have to stir the pot so much.

1180
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,499
The President was busy
with important business,

1181
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:34,459
but he's been briefed.

1182
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:38,880
He is deeply aware
of the gravity of the situation.

1183
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,217
And he emphasized
that not one life will be lost

1184
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,512
on Korean soil, no matter what.

1185
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:47,556
Don't you understand what
His Excellency wants?

1186
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,224
They're not even our citizens.

1187
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:52,227
He clearly wants the plane
to take off and be gone to the North!

1188
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,646
Oh, come on, brother!

1189
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,359
Why are you making His Excellency
into a heartless, inhumane person?

1190
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:03,780
He obviously wants to negotiate
and get them off the plane!

1191
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:06,825
I feel like we're losing.

1192
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,162
So who's right?

1193
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:14,708
What he wants is for them
to figure it out without involving him.

1194
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:20,881
Then, let's decide what His Excellency's
intentions are democratically!

1195
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,383
Majority rule.

1196
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:28,054
By a show of hands? Is this okay?

1197
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,809
Japan is sending
Minister of Transport Sugimoto

1198
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:37,814
and Deputy Minister of Transport Ishida
to Korea to work closely on the situation.

1199
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:39,858
First time in Korea?

1200
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:45,447
Just 25 years ago, everything was ours,
including this airport.

1201
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:49,409
So all the officials here
speak Japanese as a given.

1202
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:50,786
You don't need an interpreter.

1203
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,873
How did that plane end up here, I wonder?

1204
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,710
"It's not like the plan was successful."

1205
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,130
"Will you take responsibility

1206
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,049
if we end up with dead bodies?"

1207
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:10,764
That's probably how
His Excellency feels right now.

1208
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:14,100
He's right. He'll have issues
with the process as well.

1209
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,977
The Japanese will be here soon.

1210
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:19,981
Imagine if they find out
that we disguised Korea as a Red state.

1211
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,734
Wouldn't he be embarrassed
to look upon our own flag?

1212
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:49,511
Well, well. Our very own
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung.

1213
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,766
What?

1214
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:04,359
How could you turn a proud country
like ours into a Red state?

1215
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:11,324
I mean, earlier you told me to--

1216
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,913
Making excuses

1217
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:21,084
is a bad habit of those who fail.

1218
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:22,711
You know?

1219
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,634
Everyone.

1220
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,848
Can we just blame everything on the rock
because we tripped and fell on it?

1221
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:35,891
Can you?

1222
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:40,395
Put your hands down already.
What are you, children?

1223
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:42,314
A show of hands?

1224
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:45,483
Yes, majority rule is great.

1225
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:50,864
But isn't a democratic country
about respecting the minority as well?

1226
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,950
His Excellency once said

1227
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:58,663
that the US is the big brother,
and Korea and Japan are siblings.

1228
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:04,753
But those bastards keep treating us
like the youngest. Isn't that right?

1229
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:11,259
But what if we take matters
into our own hands and resolve this?

1230
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,845
Then they'll be bowing to us and saying,

1231
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,389
"Arigato, arigato."

1232
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:21,436
That's how we'll become the world's
second big brother.

1233
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,396
Use your heads!

1234
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:24,940
You're right!

1235
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,650
-You're right!
-Absolutely right.

1236
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:32,822
Doesn't it make your heart
just swell with pride?

1237
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:37,035
We must never, ever forget our history!

1238
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,580
Just thinking about it

1239
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,917
makes my blood boil and my teeth clench!

1240
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,627
Think of the Imjin War!

1241
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:48,838
Think of when those bastards invaded
during the colonial rule--

1242
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:52,008
And I'm sure they had
their own grievances.

1243
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,552
-Oh my, Mr. Kim.
-Minister.

1244
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,554
-It's been too long.
-Indeed.

1245
01:22:57,847 --> 01:22:59,474
Please have a seat, Minister.

1246
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:04,062
Our government never got word
about our civilian plane landing here.

1247
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,690
Was this an official operation
by the Korean government?

1248
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:11,111
If it were official,
wouldn't we have let you know?

1249
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:13,196
What? If it's not official…

1250
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,949
Regrettably, it seems…

1251
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:20,370
that someone here acted on their own

1252
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:23,748
and lied to them,
claiming that this was Pyongyang.

1253
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,041
Acted on their own?

1254
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,419
Who was it?

1255
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,683
I was the one…

1256
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,602
who did it.

1257
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:50,525
Thank you.

1258
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,238
It was truly a brave
and remarkable operation.

1259
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:57,866
Lieutenant Go-myung?

1260
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,334
Right.

1261
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:14,215
I was simply following the orders
from Director Park over there.

1262
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,509
I see.

1263
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:20,221
On behalf of the Japanese government,
we offer our deepest gratitude.

1264
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:27,562
There is no need for such words
between brothers!

1265
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,732
Lieutenant Seo. You're the best.

1266
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,525
What's the current situation like?

1267
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:39,449
Since the plane lost power,
they should be reaching out soon.

1268
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,827
Plan B?

1269
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,250
Did you say you were a doctor?

1270
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:54,339
What do you think they are planning?

1271
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:55,965
I don't know.

1272
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,597
Hey, listen.

1273
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,810
Why don't you ask them to start the engine
in exchange for some hostages--

1274
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,732
I want to talk to the person
who landed us here.

1275
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,901
Yes, I'm listening.

1276
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:17,195
Your voice is different.

1277
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:20,907
I am in charge here.

1278
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:25,203
Then are you the one who deceived us?

1279
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:28,373
It was a plan to save innocent lives.

1280
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:30,250
First off,

1281
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:35,421
release the passengers,
and then we can discuss conditions--

1282
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,090
Let's meet in person and talk.

1283
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:39,926
If you're the one who landed us here,

1284
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:42,262
then you should be here in person.

1285
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:44,597
Inside the plane?

1286
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,683
Come alone and unarmed.

1287
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:49,102
If you don't come within 30 minutes,

1288
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:52,856
we'll behead a hostage every ten minutes
and throw the heads out.

1289
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:54,941
Over.

1290
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:58,403
Will you really be all right alone?

1291
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,824
Unfortunately,

1292
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:08,955
they want to speak with the person

1293
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:11,291
who landed them here.

1294
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,963
These guys are really perceptive.

1295
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:21,593
I never expected them
to remember his voice.

1296
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:25,430
An order should come
from the Blue House tomorrow.

1297
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,140
Until then, you need to buy more time.

1298
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:30,351
Why the fuck do I have to get beat up
and do all the dirty work?

1299
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:35,231
My job was to land the plane safely
in Kimpo. I succeeded in my mission!

1300
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:38,818
Okay, I'm the one who failed. Better?

1301
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:40,987
Don't touch me.

1302
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:43,323
Failure is contagious.

1303
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:49,412
Ouch. That wasn't necessary!

1304
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:50,872
You hurt my feelings.

1305
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:55,335
Careful! The paint's still new there,
so it's slippery!

1306
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:23,863
Come in.

1307
01:27:38,836 --> 01:27:41,172
So you're the boy who cried Pyongyang.

1308
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,885
Could you please put the light down?

1309
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:49,514
The engine shut down
because you landed us here.

1310
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:53,309
They're connecting it now,
so the power should be on soon.

1311
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,564
I knew they'd send someone like you.

1312
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:02,610
It's typical of rank-obsessed bureaucrats.

1313
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:06,114
You knew someone like me
would have no power.

1314
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:10,535
So why did you call me here?

1315
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:19,294
I wanted to…

1316
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,755
show you their faces in person.

1317
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,718
Look carefully, boy who cried Pyongyang.

1318
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:32,932
These are the people who will die
because of your lies.

1319
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:35,768
If you don't want to become a murderer,

1320
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:39,147
send everyone on this plane
to Pyongyang right now.

1321
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,193
The weather is bad right now,
and it's too dark--

1322
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,445
You fool!

1323
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,781
You already deceived us once!

1324
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,534
Then ask the pilot!

1325
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:53,619
Moreover,

1326
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,789
if you cross
the Military Demarcation Line now,

1327
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:01,919
what will you do about the North Korean
anti-aircraft guns all over the DMZ?

1328
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,213
If you get shot down,

1329
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,216
none of your bodies will be recovered.

1330
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:23,649
We did all we can. It's time to step back

1331
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,110
and do what Mr. Kim said.

1332
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,820
Send them off to North Korea.

1333
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,870
Here's the thing.

1334
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:42,502
I never reverse even when I drive. Why?

1335
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:46,631
Because it makes me feel like
I took the wrong road the whole time,

1336
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,674
and it pisses me off!

1337
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:52,470
If I say I'm going this way,
that's the right way.

1338
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,848
And it should continue
to be the right way.

1339
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:02,271
And that's what your job is, brother.

1340
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,025
I was just worried
that if a bomb really goes off,

1341
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:10,405
you might have to take the blame for it.

1342
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:15,910
One word from me,
and he'll press the button.

1343
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:18,538
But you won't.

1344
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:22,959
Because there's nothing
you can gain from that.

1345
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:26,921
This is our Plan B.

1346
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,340
We'll burn away to white ash

1347
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,635
and show the whole world
our revolutionary will.

1348
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,013
That way,

1349
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:38,057
there will be a second

1350
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,060
and a third Ashita no Joe
following in our footsteps.

1351
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:43,104
Ashita no Joe?

1352
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,235
From the manga series?

1353
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:53,197
You know Ashita no Joe?

1354
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:56,993
Of course I do.

1355
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,370
It's a masterpiece.

1356
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:00,746
It truly is.

1357
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:02,665
Especially the ending.

1358
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:04,500
-Yes, yes, exactly!
-Right?

1359
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:08,421
At the end,

1360
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:10,590
I don't think Joe died.

1361
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,050
-What?
-No.

1362
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:15,928
He died.

1363
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:40,995
Do you think
giving up one's own life is easy?

1364
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,207
They will never be able to detonate it.

1365
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:49,670
But let's be real. It's not my fault
even if it does explode.

1366
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,174
I'm the one desperately praying
that it doesn't explode!

1367
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,136
My life…

1368
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,723
is your deadline.

1369
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:05,853
If we don't get to Pyongyang,

1370
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,065
I'll die anyway.

1371
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:12,985
How is he?

1372
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:17,365
You avoided his vital organs,
just as I taught you.

1373
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:22,411
If we can stop the bleeding,
he could last another day.

1374
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:25,623
Did you hear that, Leader?

1375
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,583
I nailed it!

1376
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,173
These lunatics…

1377
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:38,302
You have until noon tomorrow.

1378
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,931
If you go over by even one second,

1379
01:32:42,848 --> 01:32:44,976
the plane will blow up.

1380
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,771
The same conditions apply
if Leader dies first.

1381
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,023
Please.

1382
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:53,568
Please just send us to Pyongyang.

1383
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:55,194
At least that way,

1384
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,738
we can all still live!

1385
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,911
You capitalists

1386
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:09,959
only see the price tags
and not the true worth of people.

1387
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:13,963
I'm curious now.

1388
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:21,429
What price will you put
on the passengers' lives?

1389
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:26,517
I told you it's slippery there, mister!

1390
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,978
Oh, fuck it all!

1391
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:33,107
Then you should've sprinkled
some dirt on it, you son of a bitch!

1392
01:33:39,196 --> 01:33:41,324
Good work, Lieutenant Seo.

1393
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:44,452
We've got plenty of time
until noon tomorrow.

1394
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:49,081
They said they refuse
to negotiate before then.

1395
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:51,459
-Furthermore--
-What did I say?

1396
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:54,045
-We need to send them off now!
-Oh, please.

1397
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:57,798
North Korea put out a statement saying
they'll welcome them. So send them off!

1398
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:58,966
Is this fatty tuna?

1399
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:03,763
Did North Korea release a statement?

1400
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:06,474
That's medium-fatty tuna.
This is super-fatty tuna.

1401
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:08,225
-Oh, this one?
-It's good.

1402
01:34:08,851 --> 01:34:11,270
What was it like inside the plane?

1403
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:16,442
What were the hijackers like?

1404
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,155
Did they really seem dangerous enough
to carry out a suicide bombing?

1405
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:42,551
No.

1406
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:47,014
They were just reckless kids.

1407
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,265
Hey!

1408
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:51,143
Are you going to take responsibility
if things go wrong?

1409
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:54,647
Come on, he saw it with his own eyes.

1410
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:58,025
If we promise them
in His Excellency's name

1411
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,361
that we will send them to the North

1412
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:03,906
once they release all the passengers,

1413
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:05,908
this will be solved in no time.

1414
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:08,494
Then why don't we contact
the President right now?

1415
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:12,331
Right now…

1416
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:16,043
he should be in bed.

1417
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,379
-Excuse me?
-But…

1418
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:20,965
he rises early in the morning!

1419
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:23,008
Excuse me?

1420
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:25,302
-You're saying we just wait?
-That is a healthy habit.

1421
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,762
-Here?
-Let's have a smoke.

1422
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,347
-But…
-It's okay.

1423
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,934
If things go south,

1424
01:35:32,017 --> 01:35:35,312
we'll blame those idiot Josenjings.

1425
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:38,816
-Don't go kicking the hornet's nest.
-But if everything goes well,

1426
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:42,403
Korea will have
resolved everything we failed to do.

1427
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:47,658
They'll probably demand
some big favor from us.

1428
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,542
I told you. If you don't see me,
it means I'm working.

1429
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,923
Wait. There's actually
a Korean passenger onboard?

1430
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:03,883
Really?

1431
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:05,593
That's news to me.

1432
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,305
It's an assumption based on the name.
Just an assumption.

1433
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,515
I marked it right here.

1434
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:13,934
Yuuno Baku?

1435
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,644
That's a Japanese name!

1436
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:18,731
But it's in English,
so the surname comes second.

1437
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,277
Baku Yuuno. Baku Yuno.

1438
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,570
Park Yun-ho.

1439
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:30,826
Don't be ridiculous!
You're talking nonsense.

1440
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,036
Give it here!

1441
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,622
Good heavens. Leave!

1442
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:36,499
What kind of nonsense is this?

1443
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:37,875
Is the news a joke to you?

1444
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:42,421
How dare you make light
of the news in this day and age!

1445
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,715
I'm a member of the press, all right?

1446
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,884
-Director!
-What? What now?

1447
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,054
You know what I'm best at, right?

1448
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,932
-Rooting out Reds.
-No.

1449
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:58,521
Making Reds out of normal people.

1450
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:05,361
There's no need
to get all scary like that.

1451
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:10,991
I know full well
that the press shouldn't lie.

1452
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,580
So I'm telling you,
it's just an assumption.

1453
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:22,086
Today, the name Park Yun-ho, allegedly
a Korean-Japanese man, has been found

1454
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:26,173
on the list of passengers aboard
the Japanese airplane in Kimpo Airport.

1455
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:31,011
Oh, and tack on this little headline
from three months ago.

1456
01:37:33,722 --> 01:37:36,684
This incident is reminiscent
of a similar hijacking of the YS-11

1457
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:41,063
that occurred just three months ago
by the North Korean puppet army.

1458
01:37:41,146 --> 01:37:44,483
They locked us up one by one

1459
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:46,527
and then subjected us
to brutal electrical torture.

1460
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,862
What do you think?

1461
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,865
Is it tugging at your heartstrings?

1462
01:37:53,325 --> 01:37:54,451
So, that…

1463
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:57,454
Korean passenger story is a lie?

1464
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:58,873
What does it matter?

1465
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:04,086
Oh, the moon is beautiful tonight.

1466
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:08,716
Maybe the far side of the moon
isn't as beautiful.

1467
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:12,011
Did you know we'll never see
the far side of the moon?

1468
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:14,972
Because its orbit matches its rotation.

1469
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:18,350
It was a philosophical question,
not a scientific one.

1470
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:20,936
"Sometimes the truth
lies on the far side of the moon.

1471
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,022
But that doesn't mean
what's on the near side is fiction."

1472
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:24,148
By Truman Shady.

1473
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,902
-Haven't you heard that one?
-Of course I have!

1474
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:31,280
There could be all kinds of bullshit
happening in the dark,

1475
01:38:31,363 --> 01:38:33,115
but people only believe what they see.

1476
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:36,160
And that becomes the truth,
like the news.

1477
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:37,620
Maybe it's the moon making you talk crap.

1478
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,705
No matter which side you look at,
it's still the moon.

1479
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:42,207
You're the one barking nonsense, not me!

1480
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:45,169
Are you calling me a dog?

1481
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:46,921
She's here.

1482
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:50,424
Thank you for coming at such a late hour.

1483
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:54,553
Oh, you're even more beautiful in person.

1484
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:57,640
What would you like me to do?

1485
01:38:57,723 --> 01:39:00,935
Just tell the truth, that's all.

1486
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:02,937
-The others?
-They're on their way.

1487
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:06,357
We absolutely need the electrocuted guy.

1488
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,817
We are still trying to save people,
aren't we?

1489
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,322
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

1490
01:39:13,405 --> 01:39:14,782
This way, please.

1491
01:39:19,244 --> 01:39:21,830
Everything will be solved
as soon as the President gives the word.

1492
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:24,249
And if he doesn't?

1493
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:27,294
What happens then?

1494
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:32,341
Like you said,
they're a bunch of reckless kids.

1495
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:37,179
Didn't you say that
so they wouldn't send them off?

1496
01:39:53,195 --> 01:39:55,239
KIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

1497
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:03,247
The 66 days I spent in North Korea

1498
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,083
made me feel less than human.

1499
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:08,460
Sometimes, even the truth lies.

1500
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:09,628
I felt like…

1501
01:40:11,213 --> 01:40:13,674
I would be better off dead.

1502
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:16,135
And lies also tell the truth.

1503
01:40:16,218 --> 01:40:19,096
Our station spoke
with the Korean Embassy in Japan

1504
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:21,181
and was able to confirm

1505
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:24,977
13 people named Park Yun-ho
who currently reside in Japan.

1506
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,187
I was tortured and electrocuted

1507
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,982
by the puppet army.

1508
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:35,070
I am currently being treated
at a psychiatric hospital.

1509
01:40:35,612 --> 01:40:39,283
It's most likely that Mr. Park Yun-ho

1510
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:43,454
will suffer the same fate as me.

1511
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:52,337
Real events that happened,
a little bit of creativity,

1512
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:54,882
and the willingness to suspend disbelief.

1513
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:56,884
If these three components come together…

1514
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:59,970
Those damn puppet bastards from the North!

1515
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,599
-Yes!
-Take them down!

1516
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:14,943
An anti-Communist demonstration
occurred in front of Kimpo Airport.

1517
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:17,571
The people are crying out
for peace and liberty.

1518
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:22,326
And they are demanding the release
of Mr. Park Yun-ho and other passengers.

1519
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:25,204
What a sight to behold.

1520
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:31,210
Koreans are so full of love,
emotion, and energy!

1521
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:36,090
The Blue House is en route.

1522
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:40,302
I'm sure he's worried
about the election next year.

1523
01:41:41,011 --> 01:41:42,221
Wouldn't you say

1524
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:46,642
that this is the greatness of democracy?

1525
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:49,103
I wonder if he'll come in person.

1526
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:51,396
No.

1527
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:55,609
His Excellency could not make it,
for some unknown reason,

1528
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:59,321
but the First Lady will be coming instead.

1529
01:42:10,749 --> 01:42:12,960
Could you take the photos
from the left instead?

1530
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,631
That's my better side.

1531
01:42:29,101 --> 01:42:33,313
His Excellency is unwell.

1532
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:36,066
How so? Where is he feeling ill?

1533
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:38,777
Don't worry yourselves too much.

1534
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:42,823
How could you say that?

1535
01:42:42,906 --> 01:42:47,286
Depending on the condition,
it could be a national disaster.

1536
01:42:48,787 --> 01:42:49,913
He is…

1537
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:51,874
very hungover right now.

1538
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:58,130
He had a few too many drinks.

1539
01:42:58,213 --> 01:43:00,257
Send someone immediately

1540
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,676
and get some natural hangover remedy
from Taebaek Mountain.

1541
01:43:02,759 --> 01:43:04,094
His Excellency…

1542
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:12,269
is more concerned about this crisis
than his hangover.

1543
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:18,901
He holds his liquor far better
than most adult men, as you know.

1544
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:48,180
You must be the controller.

1545
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:53,143
The Republic of Korea
will never forget your service.

1546
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,396
Thank you, ma'am.

1547
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,068
Those poor people.

1548
01:44:03,987 --> 01:44:08,825
I can't imagine the fear
that is gripping them inside that plane.

1549
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:14,248
But I heard that there were…

1550
01:44:15,707 --> 01:44:18,085
some people here
who wanted to send them north.

1551
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:24,591
His Excellency was adamant
on having no casualties on our--

1552
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:26,009
Up in the North!

1553
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:30,013
Do you even know
the horrors occurring there now?

1554
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:34,643
She pointed to the east, not the north,

1555
01:44:35,477 --> 01:44:37,521
but no one said a thing.

1556
01:44:39,898 --> 01:44:44,403
If you agreed to send them
to North Korea, please leave this room.

1557
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:47,489
You don't deserve to be here.

1558
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:51,118
Ma'am, what we meant was--

1559
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:52,577
I said now!

1560
01:44:54,538 --> 01:44:56,498
That fucking crazy bitch!

1561
01:44:57,165 --> 01:45:00,210
You know what? Let it fucking blow up!

1562
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:02,587
Let it blow up!

1563
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,007
Madam.

1564
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:09,761
North Korea has already guaranteed
the safety of our citizens.

1565
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:13,598
Deputy Minister.
Do you really believe what communists say?

1566
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:17,227
What about the rest of you?

1567
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:18,770
-No, ma'am!
-No, ma'am!

1568
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:22,983
Twenty years ago…

1569
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,948
It was a peaceful Sunday morning
on June 25, 1950.

1570
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:33,827
That communist puppet army
stormed in from the North.

1571
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:38,999
They covered this land in blood
and took countless lives.

1572
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:41,752
I will never forget what happened.

1573
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,004
We cannot and will not

1574
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:48,050
believe those evil communists ever again.

1575
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:55,599
Our anti-communist hero,

1576
01:45:57,142 --> 01:45:58,810
Lee Seung-bok, was just a little boy,

1577
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:04,733
but his last words before he was killed
by the North Korean spies were…

1578
01:46:04,816 --> 01:46:08,111
-"I hate communism!"
-"I hate communism!"

1579
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:15,410
I hereby give this order in the name
of the President of the Republic of Korea.

1580
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:20,665
The second they release the passengers,
tell them to get lost and go north.

1581
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,800
That's all.

1582
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:33,845
Hooray!

1583
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:36,681
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

1584
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:57,786
-Finally, the wheels…
-Began turning again.

1585
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:00,539
Good news!

1586
01:47:00,622 --> 01:47:02,165
The document you just received

1587
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:05,043
ensures you'll be able to
enter North Korea,

1588
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:07,546
as long as you let everyone go.

1589
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:10,882
It's confirmed
by the government of Republic of Korea!

1590
01:47:10,966 --> 01:47:12,843
You fool! Are you joking?

1591
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:17,097
You want us to believe
this piece of paper?

1592
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:20,016
Your army will charge onto the plane
as soon as we let the hostages go!

1593
01:47:21,184 --> 01:47:22,561
It's for real this time.

1594
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:25,689
Just let the passengers go,

1595
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,441
and you can go wherever you want!

1596
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:30,652
There was one thing we overlooked.

1597
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:34,739
No one believed
the boy who cried wolf anymore.

1598
01:47:34,823 --> 01:47:38,493
We will only release them
after we set foot in North Korea.

1599
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:41,371
If you don't let us go, the plane
will blow exactly at noon. Over.

1600
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:50,714
Fuck.

1601
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,925
No, Leader!

1602
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:57,637
If you die before noon, I'll kill you!

1603
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,181
I lied.

1604
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:03,393
Those bastards are all insane.

1605
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,730
If that bomb goes off…

1606
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:11,067
their deaths are all on me.

1607
01:48:11,693 --> 01:48:14,446
I feel like you're thinking
too highly of yourself.

1608
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:17,824
All we did was follow orders.

1609
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:22,829
Does justifying it like that
help you sleep at night?

1610
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:30,170
Justification is a survival instinct.

1611
01:48:32,047 --> 01:48:34,549
Without it, it'd be a tough life to live.

1612
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:36,927
Considering the situation,

1613
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:39,679
isn't it time for us to try something?

1614
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:40,889
Just now,

1615
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:43,558
I was praying.

1616
01:48:43,642 --> 01:48:44,768
Praying?

1617
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:47,604
Let's have a meeting.

1618
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:49,314
Let's have a meeting!

1619
01:48:49,397 --> 01:48:50,815
What meeting?

1620
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:56,321
We cannot refute
the will of His Excellency!

1621
01:48:56,404 --> 01:48:58,406
So all you're doing is praying?

1622
01:48:58,490 --> 01:48:59,783
Praying?

1623
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:01,451
Does prayer solve the current problem?

1624
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:05,747
Will it improve the situation?
Will it please His Excellency?

1625
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:09,251
What are you going to do?

1626
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:12,128
I should at least tell them
to send them north.

1627
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:14,756
Pull yourself together.
You're just a controller.

1628
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,594
At least I'm not a nobody.

1629
01:49:23,848 --> 01:49:26,393
If I can't say what's on my mind,
how is this not a dictatorship?

1630
01:49:27,477 --> 01:49:29,187
A dictatorship?

1631
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:31,439
A dictatorship?

1632
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:35,360
At least we don't crown
and revere kings like you.

1633
01:49:35,443 --> 01:49:36,987
Don't interpret this.

1634
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:41,908
Mr. Park! You do realize
you committed a diplomatic offense, yes?

1635
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:43,994
What was that?

1636
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:46,288
Did you just hit me?

1637
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:48,248
Wow. Did you see that?

1638
01:49:48,331 --> 01:49:50,041
You saw it, right?

1639
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:53,461
He's just casually throwing hands now.

1640
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,093
Didn't anyone see that?

1641
01:50:00,176 --> 01:50:02,012
Seriously? No one saw it?

1642
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:03,388
I did!

1643
01:50:03,471 --> 01:50:05,974
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1644
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:07,267
-You did?
-Yes!

1645
01:50:08,226 --> 01:50:12,981
This is no longer about feelings offended.
This is a military provocation!

1646
01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:15,108
And from now on, everything's in Korean.

1647
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:17,027
This is the Republic of Korea!

1648
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:19,195
-Mr. Park!
-Lieutenant Seo.

1649
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:22,282
You get it, don't you?
This is a game of chicken.

1650
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:25,452
They'll never be able to detonate it,
so don't call them.

1651
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:30,248
Answer.

1652
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:34,669
Hey, you little punk. Answer me!

1653
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:48,475
Praying?

1654
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:50,185
Praying doesn't change anything!

1655
01:50:50,268 --> 01:50:52,145
Stupid idiots!

1656
01:50:52,228 --> 01:50:55,315
Idiots! You stupid idiots!
Use your heads, you fools!

1657
01:50:55,398 --> 01:50:58,026
Are you all lacking brain cells?
Do you not have a brain at all?

1658
01:50:58,693 --> 01:51:03,114
Whether the bomb blows up or not,
the result's already been decided.

1659
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:06,076
So you should get out of here first.

1660
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:10,288
Do you really think they'll blow it up?

1661
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:11,247
No, right?

1662
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:12,791
Of course not.

1663
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:17,045
But if anything does happen,

1664
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,465
everything falls on the field commander.

1665
01:51:21,424 --> 01:51:25,553
That's right! The field commander.
How dare this shameless--

1666
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:27,347
Wait a second.

1667
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,974
That's me, isn't it?

1668
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:33,103
Of course not.

1669
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,606
You're the one who assigns
the field commander.

1670
01:51:37,315 --> 01:51:41,194
There are so many other pressing issues,
but we've neglected them for so long!

1671
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:44,114
Return to your posts and do your duty!

1672
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:47,325
-Serve the country with all your heart!
-Let's go!

1673
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:49,911
Those brainless idiots!

1674
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:56,209
What is the point in praying?

1675
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:29,451
Religion…

1676
01:52:31,035 --> 01:52:34,164
It's a business that can never fail,
don't you think?

1677
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:37,709
Desperate people end up
turning to God--

1678
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:40,211
You have no right to mock me!

1679
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,756
You don't even have a plan!

1680
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,219
Was it any different

1681
01:52:49,095 --> 01:52:50,472
in your country, sir?

1682
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:56,311
I'm so mad.

1683
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:05,111
There's nothing I can do…

1684
01:53:06,988 --> 01:53:09,407
except stand here and watch.

1685
01:53:10,742 --> 01:53:12,994
This feeling of helplessness…

1686
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,711
Do you have anything to say
to the victims of this incident?

1687
01:54:03,795 --> 01:54:06,589
Lieutenant Seo Go-myung,
say something.

1688
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:11,177
Defendant Seo Go-myung
aided in the deaths of 106 innocent lives

1689
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:14,055
and is hereby sentenced to death.

1690
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:25,316
Why the hell are you breaking stuff?

1691
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:28,611
-You're not going to talk to them?
-Did you not…

1692
01:54:29,612 --> 01:54:31,322
Did you not hear what Director Park said?

1693
01:54:31,406 --> 01:54:32,448
He said not to initiate!

1694
01:54:34,576 --> 01:54:36,160
Director Park isn't here right now.

1695
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:38,705
How so?

1696
01:54:38,788 --> 01:54:41,165
That fucking motherfucker!

1697
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:44,460
What am I supposed to do here?
He dumped all of this on me now?

1698
01:54:44,544 --> 01:54:46,754
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1699
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:50,258
He suddenly named me field commander!

1700
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:54,888
It's you, isn't it? You bastard!
You dumped this shit show on me!

1701
01:54:54,971 --> 01:54:56,014
Minister!

1702
01:54:56,097 --> 01:54:58,808
It certainly is a shit show.

1703
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:02,437
But the question is,
who made this shit show?

1704
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,898
Why does the field commander
always have to take the blame?

1705
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:09,444
The one who ignored orders
and caused this shit show

1706
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:11,946
is right over there.

1707
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,327
-What are you doing?
-You bastard!

1708
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:19,329
How are you going to fix this?

1709
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,758
Japanese Ride 351.

1710
01:55:31,841 --> 01:55:33,426
Japanese Ride 351.

1711
01:55:33,509 --> 01:55:35,386
This is Kimpo Control Tower.

1712
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,807
The military is withdrawing.

1713
01:55:40,683 --> 01:55:42,352
Is this your answer?

1714
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:44,896
I will not lie to you anymore.

1715
01:55:44,979 --> 01:55:47,982
The condition still stands.

1716
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:52,070
As I told you earlier,
if you let the hostages go,

1717
01:55:52,153 --> 01:55:53,571
everyone can live.

1718
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:56,324
Don't try to stall for time.

1719
01:55:59,535 --> 01:56:01,204
Even Leader…

1720
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:04,707
doesn't have much time left.

1721
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:07,335
Are you going to give up this easily?

1722
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:11,172
Ashita no Joe fought until the end.

1723
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:29,941
You're right, boy who cried Pyongyang.

1724
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:33,194
Ashita no Joe

1725
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:37,156
burned brightly
until there were only ashes.

1726
01:56:38,741 --> 01:56:43,037
After that death, there was nothing left.

1727
01:56:43,621 --> 01:56:46,040
Nothing half-burned left behind.

1728
01:56:47,208 --> 01:56:49,544
Just pure white ash.

1729
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:53,506
Even though he didn't win in the end,

1730
01:56:55,758 --> 01:56:58,511
that alone made it worthwhile
and meaningful.

1731
01:56:59,470 --> 01:57:01,764
Ashita no Joe didn't die!

1732
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:05,143
The illustrator didn't color it in!

1733
01:57:05,226 --> 01:57:07,854
So it just looks like he turned white
and faded into death!

1734
01:57:07,937 --> 01:57:10,648
Please. Please!

1735
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:12,275
Let's meet and talk.

1736
01:57:12,817 --> 01:57:14,527
I'll come back in!

1737
01:57:15,778 --> 01:57:17,155
Oh, fuck!

1738
01:57:21,492 --> 01:57:25,580
We've done all we can now.

1739
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:33,296
In the end,

1740
01:57:34,088 --> 01:57:36,174
there are things
that can only end with sacrifice.

1741
01:57:36,257 --> 01:57:38,718
FOUR MINUTES BEFORE DETONATION

1742
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:41,637
I don't know
whether I wanted to save them

1743
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:47,226
or I just didn't want to kill them.

1744
01:57:48,436 --> 01:57:52,815
I was dragged here out of the blue,
made some absurd plan…

1745
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:54,400
May I say this is North Korea?

1746
01:57:56,694 --> 01:57:58,696
I hijacked the airwaves

1747
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:01,574
and turned Kimpo into Pyongyang.

1748
01:58:04,952 --> 01:58:06,829
I may never become a hero,

1749
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,707
but I did not want to become a murderer.

1750
01:58:13,961 --> 01:58:16,047
No. Please, no!

1751
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:17,048
No!

1752
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:46,577
FOUR MINUTES AGO

1753
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:47,829
In the end,

1754
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,207
there are things
that can only end with sacrifice.

1755
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:53,417
Sacrifice?

1756
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:56,129
In other words,

1757
01:58:56,754 --> 01:58:58,714
you'd call it "responsibility."

1758
01:59:00,133 --> 01:59:03,553
Just like the boy who ran out just now.

1759
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:05,304
He didn't pray.

1760
01:59:07,348 --> 01:59:08,558
He took action.

1761
01:59:21,779 --> 01:59:23,114
Can you hear me?

1762
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:27,201
I am Shinichi Ishida,
the Deputy Minister of Transport.

1763
01:59:27,952 --> 01:59:29,704
I request a hostage exchange.

1764
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:33,249
I will go to Pyongyang with you.

1765
01:59:34,458 --> 01:59:38,588
As Japan's Deputy Minister of Transport,
I can be your ticket to Pyongyang.

1766
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:41,507
No.

1767
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:42,842
Please, no!

1768
01:59:42,925 --> 01:59:44,051
No!

1769
01:59:45,887 --> 01:59:47,346
That must hurt.

1770
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:50,933
You've worked hard,

1771
01:59:51,517 --> 01:59:53,227
boy who cried Pyongyang.

1772
01:59:56,272 --> 02:00:00,151
The communists, who swore
to tear down classism and capitalism,

1773
02:00:00,651 --> 02:00:04,739
ended up setting the price
for more than 100 civilians

1774
02:00:04,822 --> 02:00:06,824
as that of one Japanese Deputy Minister.

1775
02:00:24,842 --> 02:00:28,971
After much effort from our government,
over 50 Japanese hostages were freed

1776
02:00:29,055 --> 02:00:31,307
from the violent,
reckless Red Army Faction

1777
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,810
and emerged in more or less good health.

1778
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:41,692
Think of it as a little trip.

1779
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:43,277
To North Korea?

1780
02:00:44,904 --> 02:00:46,572
How is this a little trip?

1781
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:52,536
However, in exchange,

1782
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:58,292
Deputy Minister Ishida was taken hostage
by the North Korean puppet army.

1783
02:00:58,834 --> 02:01:01,254
Once Deputy Minister Shinichi
boarded the plane,

1784
02:01:01,337 --> 02:01:06,092
the rest of the passengers
were able to return to their families.

1785
02:01:41,252 --> 02:01:43,796
Your Excellency! How's your hangover?

1786
02:01:43,879 --> 02:01:47,967
CHAPTER 5
GOOD NEWS

1787
02:01:49,468 --> 02:01:51,929
We hijacked their transmission.

1788
02:01:54,265 --> 02:01:57,893
As they hijacked a physical plane,

1789
02:01:57,977 --> 02:02:01,814
we hijacked the invisible airwaves.

1790
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:06,986
When you say "we,"
who else do you mean, Lieutenant?

1791
02:02:14,076 --> 02:02:16,037
For every big job like this…

1792
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:21,709
there are always people who put in
their work namelessly and tirelessly.

1793
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:24,712
I'll leave it at that.

1794
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:30,843
So the aircraft
didn't land here by mistake

1795
02:02:30,926 --> 02:02:34,013
but due to deliberate efforts
from our government.

1796
02:02:34,096 --> 02:02:36,766
Will it not cause North Korea
to provoke us somehow?

1797
02:02:39,643 --> 02:02:40,895
The Republic of Korea

1798
02:02:41,937 --> 02:02:44,065
continues its strong alliance with the US

1799
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:47,985
and will not bow down to any threat.

1800
02:02:49,612 --> 02:02:54,200
You are a hero who saved 106 lives.
What's next in store for you?

1801
02:02:54,825 --> 02:02:57,370
I'll have to finish
today's shift, first of all.

1802
02:02:58,329 --> 02:02:59,914
Then I'll head back to base

1803
02:03:00,498 --> 02:03:03,167
and catch myself on the nine o'clock news.

1804
02:03:16,222 --> 02:03:17,390
Jeez.

1805
02:03:18,891 --> 02:03:20,684
I really had to go today.

1806
02:03:20,768 --> 02:03:22,603
You're getting way too comfortable here.

1807
02:03:22,686 --> 02:03:24,397
Hey, wait for me!

1808
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:31,570
You used me as a pawn to move
that Japanese minister, didn't you?

1809
02:03:32,613 --> 02:03:34,907
I wasn't entirely sure it would work.

1810
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:39,537
But you two just looked the most sincere.

1811
02:03:47,837 --> 02:03:50,965
There's no way you don't
have a bathroom at home.

1812
02:03:52,007 --> 02:03:54,385
Good news, bad news.

1813
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,221
Which one do you want first?

1814
02:03:57,304 --> 02:03:59,348
Don't scare me like that.

1815
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:04,520
It's better to take a hit first.

1816
02:04:06,063 --> 02:04:08,983
Then we'll start with the bad news.

1817
02:04:16,574 --> 02:04:19,827
They landed in Pyongyang yesterday.

1818
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:25,040
They'll be returning the Deputy Minister
and the pilots safely too.

1819
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:28,377
That's great.
Then why is this the bad news?

1820
02:04:29,879 --> 02:04:32,590
We got some intel
from our spies over there last night.

1821
02:04:33,215 --> 02:04:35,509
All the guns and bombs they had…

1822
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,304
were fake.

1823
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:42,600
What?

1824
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:45,394
That makes no sense.

1825
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:49,273
We never intended

1826
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:52,485
to kill the passengers.

1827
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:56,071
If we couldn't make it to Pyongyang,

1828
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:59,325
we had resolved to take our lives
with the Japanese sword.

1829
02:05:03,037 --> 02:05:05,664
That was our Plan B.

1830
02:05:06,290 --> 02:05:09,960
Then we ended up saving their lives.

1831
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:12,838
What about the good news?

1832
02:05:14,048 --> 02:05:16,175
It's about the president's hangover
from yesterday.

1833
02:05:16,258 --> 02:05:18,344
It seems that he had a drink
with the US ambassador.

1834
02:05:18,427 --> 02:05:23,641
Turns out the US will begin talks
with the Soviets.

1835
02:05:23,724 --> 02:05:25,059
A good thing, to be sure.

1836
02:05:25,142 --> 02:05:28,896
At that rate, we could also eventually
reunify with North Korea.

1837
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,190
Isn't that good news?

1838
02:05:36,403 --> 02:05:39,865
So you're saying that if we beef
with North Korea, it upsets the US?

1839
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:41,450
Is that it?

1840
02:05:41,534 --> 02:05:43,327
You sure catch on quickly.

1841
02:05:45,913 --> 02:05:48,457
Officially, our government
was never involved.

1842
02:05:51,585 --> 02:05:53,420
Don't be ridiculous.

1843
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:57,132
Like the North is going to believe that
after all that ruckus.

1844
02:05:57,967 --> 02:06:01,679
They need to play along
because the Soviets want it that way too.

1845
02:06:08,561 --> 02:06:09,603
Then…

1846
02:06:12,606 --> 02:06:14,108
what about my promotion?

1847
02:06:15,442 --> 02:06:16,860
And my medals?

1848
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:20,614
Are they all gone too?

1849
02:06:22,658 --> 02:06:24,451
Even the interview you gave today…

1850
02:06:26,537 --> 02:06:29,873
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

1851
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,462
How the fuck is this good news?

1852
02:06:40,968 --> 02:06:44,471
Everything ended well, and nobody died.

1853
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:48,559
Including you.

1854
02:06:55,274 --> 02:06:57,693
You're threatening me
to keep my mouth shut, aren't you?

1855
02:06:58,444 --> 02:07:00,029
And what if I won't?

1856
02:07:03,407 --> 02:07:05,034
You know what will happen.

1857
02:07:18,756 --> 02:07:20,507
Is this how you always felt?

1858
02:07:23,719 --> 02:07:25,471
I told you.

1859
02:07:26,513 --> 02:07:28,015
It's still the moon.

1860
02:07:31,685 --> 02:07:35,606
It doesn't need a name
in order to exist.

1861
02:07:37,566 --> 02:07:41,320
It also doesn't need to be recognized
to hold meaning on its own.

1862
02:07:43,322 --> 02:07:44,573
What you did,

1863
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:47,910
in itself,

1864
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:51,121
was worthwhile.

1865
02:08:54,601 --> 02:08:59,732
The heroes who saved
over 100 passengers have returned.

1866
02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:02,109
Shinichi Ishida,
the Deputy Minister of Transport,

1867
02:09:02,192 --> 02:09:05,946
exchanged himself for the hostages
at Kimpo, Korea,

1868
02:09:06,029 --> 02:09:08,449
and saved 106 lives.

1869
02:09:08,532 --> 02:09:12,077
Our heroes, Captain Takahiro Kubo
and co-pilot Seigo Maeda,

1870
02:09:12,161 --> 02:09:14,204
made an emergency landing in Itazuke

1871
02:09:14,288 --> 02:09:17,416
and saved 23 lives.

1872
02:09:17,499 --> 02:09:19,251
No, I don't deserve to be called a hero.

1873
02:09:20,294 --> 02:09:22,421
As Japan's Deputy Minister of Transport,

1874
02:09:22,504 --> 02:09:23,422
I simply did my duty.

1875
02:09:23,505 --> 02:09:25,674
After enduring 10,000 flight hours,

1876
02:09:26,675 --> 02:09:28,051
I have incurred hemorrhoids.

1877
02:09:30,345 --> 02:09:31,722
But right now,

1878
02:09:32,931 --> 02:09:35,309
I am proud of them.

1879
02:09:35,893 --> 02:09:38,687
It was an honor to serve alongside
your hemorrhoids, Captain!

1880
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:53,410
"Sometimes the truth
lies on the far side of the moon."

1881
02:09:54,203 --> 02:09:57,080
"But that doesn't mean
what's on the near side is fiction."

1882
02:09:57,748 --> 02:09:59,500
By Truman Shady.

1883
02:10:00,751 --> 02:10:01,710
Right…

1884
02:10:05,047 --> 02:10:07,841
-It's still the moon.
-I'd like to confess something.

1885
02:10:07,925 --> 02:10:11,929
I did not know that quote by Truman Shady.

1886
02:10:12,012 --> 02:10:14,223
-Of course not.
-It's still the moon.

1887
02:10:14,306 --> 02:10:17,017
He never said such a thing.

1888
02:10:17,518 --> 02:10:18,477
Ta-da.

1889
02:10:21,855 --> 02:10:22,940
By the way,

1890
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:25,609
why did you choose that name,
of all names?

1891
02:10:25,692 --> 02:10:27,653
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
CHOI GO-MYUNG

1892
02:10:29,613 --> 02:10:30,614
Just because.

1893
02:10:33,242 --> 02:10:36,411
So you want to know
who Truman Shady is?

1894
02:10:39,081 --> 02:10:40,624
What does it matter?

1895
02:10:41,333 --> 02:10:42,626
He's just…

1896
02:10:43,252 --> 02:10:44,586
Nobody.

1897
