- Yes.

39
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,216
We need to get out as quickly as we can.
How can we get to the lower levels?

40
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,969
The VIP lounge
has an elevator we can access.

41
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,096
- That'd be the quickest.
- Okay.

52

00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,472
Huh?

177
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,475
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

178
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,936
What the hell?

179
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,773
- Your leg.
- Uh, he could have gotten that anywhere.

180
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,692
Uh, surely it isn't what we think.

181
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,527
It isn't right?

182
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,696
But it is. It was a zombie.

183
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,698
- You...
- Shit.

184
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783
- Whoa.
- What? What are you doing?

185
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,702
- Huh?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

186
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,788
He told us he was bit, didn't he?
He could turn any minute.

187
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,499
He's a danger to us all.

188
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,708
He hasn't turned yet.

189
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,710
You need to relax and lower your gun.

190
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,254
That's right, soldier.
Kyung-sik, lower the gun, huh?

191
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,589
You asshole.

192
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,716
We need to keep moving
and get out of here.

193
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,759
Lower it.

194
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,306
Honestly, I don't think
he should ride with us either.

195
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,225
Let's close the door and keep going.

196
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,976
Wait, hold on for a second.

197
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,146
That bite was made
a couple of hours ago, right?

198
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,273
That means he isn't turning.

199
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,692
Since you aren't turning,
you can come with us.

200
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,028
No way in hell. It's too dangerous.

201
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,114
Let him come with us.

202
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,911
- Please, you guys.
- It's okay.

203
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,664
He's right. It's too dangerous.
You guys go ahead.

204
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,709
Hey, look.

205
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,795
If I were to bite you...

206
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,049
I couldn't forgive myself for it.

207
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,636
Don't cry. Okay?

208
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,518
Oh, wait. Wait.

209
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,487
Manager, uh, thank you for everything.

210
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,324
I will never forget you.

211
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,795
Oh, shit.

212
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,422
What is it?

213
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,929
Get out now!

214
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,068
You should get on. You can get on.

215
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,111
Come on.

216
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,880

219
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,511
- Grandma!
- Kyung-soo.

220
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,680
- Grandma.
- It's okay.

221
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,515
It's okay. You'll be okay.

222
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,393
- Grandma.
- Just get off at the last station.

223
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,312
- I'm so scared.
- Wait for me.

224
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,730
I'll be there soon.

225
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,857
- Hurry.
- Kyung-soo.

226
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,027
- It's leaving, careful.
- I'll get you. Wait.

227
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,196
I'll find a way.

228
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,864
Don't forget. Wait for me.

229
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,158
- Please stop!
- No, no. I'll be there.

230
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,369
- Just wait!
- Please, come here.

231
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,959
I promise he'll be okay.

232
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,296
Oh, God.

233
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,714
Kyung-soo!

234
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,100
No!

235
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,769
No!

236
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,208
You saved me.

237
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,424
I'll kill you.

238
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,344

- Wait.

00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,813
- I'll kill you all.
- Wait. Ma'am, wait.

242
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,150

243
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,902

It's too dangerous.

Oh, my Kyung-soo.
My dear, Kyung-soo.

250
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:54,365
Stay close to the wall.

<i>For your safety,</i>

252

Get in.

276
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,282
Huh?

277
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,044
Hey, hey, hey. Don't go that way.

278
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,379
Over there. The other side.
That way. That way.

279
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,298

281
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,221
Stupid piece of shit.

282
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,064
Manager. Hey, hurry up!

283
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,150
Huh? Shit.

284
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,820
Damn it!

285
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,823
Come on. Go!

286
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,453
- Fucking hell.
- Damn it.

287
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,871
Come. This way.

288
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,040
Damn it.

289
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,459
Oh!

290
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,503
Kyung-sik! This one's open.

291
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,380
- Run, manager. Run, manager.
- Go!

292
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:05,009
- What're you doing?
- No, don't close it.

293
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:09,013
Wait! Huh? What the hell?

294
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:12,475
- Hey, what's wrong with you?
- Letting him inside is suicide.

295
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,937
Come on. Open!
What's your problem?

296
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,522
Hey!

297
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,440
Hey. Hey!

298
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,692
Have you lost it? Step aside.

299
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,653
I said move, damn it.

300
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,571
Get your fucking shit together, sir.

301
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,657
Open the door! Hey!

302
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,513
I suppose it's been a good run.

303
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,233
Hmm?

304
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,171
Want a bite? Maybe a nibble? Small one?

305
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,801
Why did you do that?

306
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,596
There was plenty of time to let him in.

307
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,974
With that bite on his ankle,
it's only a matter of time.

308
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,186
He'll eventually turn
into a zombie and murder us.

309
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,396
- This is serious.
- Hey!

310
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,772
Huh?

311
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,526
Huh?

312
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,404
- I'm not dead yet.
- Huh?

313
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,994
And no bites either. Not one.

314
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,582
I have a feeling that
I'm not gonna die out here.

315
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,918
Forgive us, Manager Park.

316
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,003
No, no, no, no.
It's all right, Sergeant Kim.

317
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,588
There's no need to say sorry.

319
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,803
You got bitten. You've been infected.

320
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,805
You're lying.

321
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,849
You're gonna attack us.

322
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,978
Hey, Private.
I don't think I quite enjoy the way

323
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,147
that you're talking to me.

324

I mean...

325
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,572
Not that it matters. Let me tell you...

326
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,327
that I'll never forget this.

327
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,506

00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,652
- That's funny.
- Oh, Soo-jeong.

354
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,613
I'll clean this up for you.
You can lie down and rest.

355
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,535
I don't want to.
Why the hell would I do that?

356
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,620
Huh? What is wrong with you, bro?

357
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,790
Okay, I see the issue.

358
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,836
Yeah. I think you're misunderstanding
what I'm trying to say here.

359
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,463
Maybe you'd like to relax?

360
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,385
That's not what I meant.

361
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,304
All I was trying to do was...

362
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,806
Usually, it's common courtesy to--

363
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,059
You know what?
Just forget it. Okay? Yeah. Yeah.

364
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,519
Just rest. Yeah, okay.

365
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,688
Huh.

366
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,667
Employees pay for these?

367
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,670
Public enterprise welfare, my ass.

368
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:21,779
Awesome.

369
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:26,367
Oh, this really sucks.

370
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,246
<i>We don't have enough ammo</i>

371
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,914
<i>to shoot our way through.</i>

372
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,332
There's too many zombies.

373
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,962
There's gotta be
a safe way for us to get out.

374
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:38,879
<i>Any ideas?</i>

375
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,925
Do you guys think
we could blow up the zombies?

376
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,678
We could throw a few grenades
and then run downstairs.

377
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,679
That's impossible.

378
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,308
An explosion of that magnitude would
attract the attention of all the zombies.

379
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,690
Cancel that.

380
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,238
We have to conserve these,
if that's all that we've got.

381
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,034
- Hmm?
- All yours.

382
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,494
Oh, thank you.

384
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,338
Hey, what is this?

385
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:23,215
Huh? Huh?

386
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,092
Oh.

387
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:36,270
f somehow we survive this,
I'd like to go on a date with you.

388
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:41,734
The thing is, you know,
I don't think it's really the time

389
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,110
for this kind of shit.

390
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:47,406
Yes. I know that,
but here's the thing, Soo-jeong.

391
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,659
Uh, all of my entire life

392
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,246
I've always just sort of sat back
and gone with the flow.

393
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,332
Acting that way will get me killed now.

394
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,462
And I've realized
that I need a reason to live.

395
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,173
You make me want to live another day.

396
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,008
That's a brand new feeling for me.

397
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,011
What I'm trying to say is, you are...

398
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,642
the only motivation I need
to get through this.

399
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,279
Sure, I guess so.

400
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,949
You have to take me to a nice restaurant.

401
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,369
You got it?

402
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,746
Well, it's a date, then.

403
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,665
Really? Okay.

404
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,792
Oh, Soo-jeong, seriously?

405
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,295
Oh.
Now the only option is survival.

406
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,256
Oh, my God!

407
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,551
Whatever.

408
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:58,769
What?

409
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,692
Okay.

410
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,322
Does this thing even work?

411
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,991
DEFECTIVE

412
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,285
When it rains, it pours, doesn't it?

413
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,122
<i>Young-joo.</i>

414
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,346
Tch. Look at me putting my degree to work.

415
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,890
I guess mechanical engineering
is saving my life.

416
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,018
<i>Young-joo.</i>

417
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,312
Huh? What?

418
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,273
Will you give it a rest already? Ugh!

419
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,287
Hi-ya!

420
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,597
MY NAME IS KANG YOUNG-JOO,
AND I'M BORROWING SOME EQUIPMENT

421
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,056
P.S. I HAD THE SOJU, NOODLES, AND CHIPS

422
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,404
I don't think it's safe to go outside yet.

423
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,989
- Huh?
- What?

424
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,216
- I found it.
- What?

425
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,636
- Hey, Lee-Jae-yoon!
- What is it?

426
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,971
I think we can use the vents to get out.

427
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:01,767
Wait. Why's he outside? Wait.

428
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,352
Arron Park.

429
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,312
- Hold up, I'll get the door.
- <i>No, no.</i>

430
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,193
- Huh?
<i>- The zombies don't bite me anymore.</i>

431
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,905
<i>Just don't put yourself in danger</i>
<i>by opening up the door.</i>

432
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,032
They don't bite. But why?

433
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,992
<i>Why? Great question.</i>

434
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,914
There must be a reason why
Arron Park isn't changing.

435
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:25,833
<i>Anyway...</i>

436
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,669
<i>You should know</i>
<i>that there's a way to get downstairs</i>

437
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,171
<i>without having to use</i>
<i>the hallways or elevators.</i>

438
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,090
Wait, really? Where do we go?

439
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,133
<i>See that vent in the middle of the room?</i>

440
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,803
<i>You can use it to escape.</i>

441
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,472
<i>The vent has a way out for all of you.</i>

442
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,978
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>An excellent idea, right?</i>

443
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,690
That is exactly what I was gonna say.

444
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,569
This is Private Lee Jae-yoon.

445
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,405
Sergeant Kim Young-man.
Corporal Kwak Gye-young, can you read me?

446
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,323
Corporal Kwak Gye-young, awaiting orders.

447
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,243
I'm here too.

448
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,829
<i>Everyone, pay attention.</i>

449
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,082
<i>I'll go over the escape plan</i>
<i>that Arron Park and I put together.</i>

450
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,168
All of your rooms should have a vent
right in the center of the ceiling.

451
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,045
<i>You'll first need to open the ventilator.</i>

452
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,007
<i>You'll then need to widen</i>
<i>the ventilation entrance to fit through.</i>

453
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,264
Use your rifles
or anything strong enough

454
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,724
to start breaking down the wall.

455
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,184
Although the vents should be empty,

456
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,438
we've seen hordes of zombies
every single step of the way.

457
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,024
<i>So make sure to always be on the look.</i>

458
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,859
<i>Once inside the ventilation system,</i>

459
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,445
<i>you'll have to navigate it</i>
<i>and reach the main vent.</i>

460
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,698
<i>From there, we'll have a direct way out</i>
<i>via the access ladders.</i>

461
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,702
<i>Given the situation in the hallway,</i>
<i>I think this is our best option.</i>

462
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,040
Okay, so we'll enter the vent
in exactly 30 minutes.

463
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,627
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Working on widening the entrance.</i>

464
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,847
Whoa, whoa, there.

465
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,435
Uh... Excuse me.

466
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,396
Oh, oh, oh.

467
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,332
Mrs. Kim shame on you.

468
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,126
How many times did I ask you
not to drink at work, huh?

469
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,803
Three stashed bottles. Jeez, lady.

470
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:53,897
Ah!

471
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,713
<i>We just have</i>
<i>to follow the vents, right?</i>

472
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,589
<i>How will we know which way to go?</i>

473
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:22,217
<i>Arron Park</i>
<i>will be guiding us through the vents.</i>

474
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,470
<i>He supervised</i>
<i>the ventilation system's construction</i>

475
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,097
<i>and knows the layout by heart.</i>

476
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,143
<i>He'll mark arrows to show the right path</i>
<i>we must take to reach the main vent.</i>

477
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,770
<i>All our team needs to do</i>
<i>is follow the arrows.</i>

478
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:39,943
That's the plan.

479
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,029
We must be quick and quiet.

480
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,410
Sergeant Kim Young-man,
Corporal Kwak Gye-young,

481
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,578
awaiting your orders.

482
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,122
Yes. We're all set here.

483
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,374
Corporal Kwak Gye-young.
We're ready to go.

484
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,084
Good luck to everyone.

485
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,669
See you all on the other side!

486
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,672
How was that?

487
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:03,383
Yeah. Gye-young is right, you guys.

488
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,926
Everyone, make it out alive.

489
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,386
That's an order.

490
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,389
Directly from your squad commander.

491
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:12,017
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>
<i>- Sir, yes, sir.</i>

492
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,811
- Dumb asses.
- All squad members,

493
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,022
are now clear to begin their escape route.

494
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,450
Paolo, take my hand. Grab it.

495
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,544
Be careful.

496
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,672
Are you worried about me?

497
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,175
Shut up and climb!

498
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,809
Hey, you see the arrows?

499
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,311
Fucking hell.

500
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,565
Kyung-sik! Wait for me.

501
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:06,071
Ah, shit.

502
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,123
Turn left. Turn left.

503
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,388
Let's do this.

504
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:40,564
Okay.

505
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,294
Shit!

506
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,356
Hold on.

507
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,358
All the arrows are gone.

508
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,402
What's up?

509
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,822
You actually made it.

510
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,032
Are you okay, Paolo?

511
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,076
No.

512
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,454
I'm fine, Arron.
Let's just keep going, okay?

513
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,747
God, I'm so hot.

514
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,291
Hey, so, how far away are we?

515
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,710
Almost there.

516
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:28,046
We're five minutes away,
so come on, let's go.

517
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,340
Okay, let's go.

518
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,014
Go, go, go. Go, go.

519
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,441
Where the fuck are the arrows?

520
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,991
Hey, wait. Soo-jeong. Soo-jeong.

521
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,867
- Huh?
- You're, um...

522
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,869
You're tensing up your body.

523
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,372
You'll get tired quicker
and won't advance much.

524
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,124
What you need to do is relax your body

525
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,126
and use both your forearms

526
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,962
to push and you gradually move forward.

527
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,422
Like this.

528
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:12,132
Oh.

529
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,635
Like this? Oh!

530
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,554
It's way easier like this.

531
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:20,807
Right?

532
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,393
Like this. Like this.

533
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,770
Like this.

534
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,314
I don't really have many talents,

535
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,733
but I did win first place in boot camp
for crawling.

536
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,401
Jesus Christ.

537
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,570
Not like that.
Relax your lower body.

538
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,238
- Like this?
- Like this.

539
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:39,909
What are you doing?

540
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:41,828
Check out the backwards crawl.

541
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,164
This one's on your back. Like this.

542
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,832
Huh?

543
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,568
Gye-young, get it together.

544
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,737
We still have to go on a date!

545
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,823
- Come on! Come on!
- Over there! That way!

546
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,383
Soo-jeong, just a bit more.
Just keep going.

547
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,299
Oh, my God!
