00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:07,627
[Episode 1]

2
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,217
What is your business?

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,250
I came from Hwaeomsan
to see the sheriff.

4
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,750
You don't look familiar.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,820
Are you here alone?
What about the others?

6
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,720
They will arrive soon.

7
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,190
How much gold will these yield?

8
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:13,983
Enough to fill a money chest, I'm sure.

9
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:17,882
Oh, yes.

10
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:19,323
However...

11
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,780
What?

12
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,326
Workers are dying from intense labor.

13
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,390
They're suffering
from injuries and an epidemic.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,460
They are criminals.

15
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,490
Hard labor is their punishment to bear,

16
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,630
so why must I be concerned with them?

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,076
Do you truly not hear the cries

18
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,886
of the people suffering

19
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,510
from a corrupt official's extortion?

20
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,280
What? A corrupt official?

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,280
How dare you!

22
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,766
Here comes the royal secret agent!

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,820
What?

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,306
- Where? Where is he?
- It's the royal secret agent!

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,960
Where's the royal secret...

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
Here I am. A royal secret agent.

27
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,510
So, tell me.

28
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,610
What did you do with all that
abundant amount of gold?

29
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,850
You!

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,020
Tell the truth!

31
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,930
Who are you?

32
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,240
You covered your face,
so you must not be a man of honor.

33
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,010
It's you.

34
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,187
[One month later]

35
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,550
Your Majesty, the secret agent system
must be abolished.

36
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,056
For what reason?

37
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,426
The royal secret agent
is an outdated system.

38
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,666
Recently, it has become difficult
for the royal agents to maintain cover.

39
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,526
And moreover, some royal agents have
revealed their secret identities

40
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,460
and are taking bribes.

41
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,806
The royal agents have acted
as my eyes and ears,

42
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,916
and given me a chance to listen
to my subjects' hardships.

43
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,416
Moreover, they exposed corrupt officials,

44
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,910
rescuing and comforting
my subjects from misery.

45
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,656
Do you still say it is unnecessary?

46
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,020
We will do that for you.

47
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,590
Your Majesty, do you not trust us?

48
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,096
Dispatching secret agents
is my prerogative.

49
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,720
Do not interfere.

50
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,936
Your Majesty, rumor has it

51
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,176
that Head Special Advisor Park Cheolgyu
was killed

52
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,470
after being dispatched
as a royal secret agent.

53
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:12,410
Send no more agents
and prevent the loss of innocent lives.

54
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,056
Similar incidents occurred
in the previous generation,

55
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,150
but the late king never stopped
dispatching secret agents.

56
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,250
Park Cheolgyu was caring
for 3 children and his widowed mother.

57
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,360
Who will look after them now?

58
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,306
Your Majesty! I beg your kindness.

59
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,630
- We beg your kindness, Your Majesty!
- We beg your kindness, Your Majesty!

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
I have sent someone out into town.

61
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,610
I will be getting information soon,
so let's give it some time.

62
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,780
Who gave you permission to send a man?

63
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,586
I ordered him.

64
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,950
Why? Do I not have the authority?

65
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,190
This is not my night.

66
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,930
Five brass coins.

67
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,330
You know how to scare people.

68
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,137
I fold.

69
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,130
Oh, I fold too.

70
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,316
Born empty handed, die empty handed.

71
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,510
I will see your five coins
and raise you ten more.

72
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,395
While we are at it,

73
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,350
how about we raise the stakes?

74
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,519
I will see your ten coins

75
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
and raise you ten more.

76
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,940
I'm getting a bad feeling for some reason.

77
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Fine.

78
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,530
I'm going all-in.

79
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,746
Eunuch Kim, are you sure?

80
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,770
I'm tired.

81
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
In that case...

82
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,916
Born empty handed, die empty handed, no?

83
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,610
This is why I like you.
Very straightforward.

84
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,350
Oh, stop it.

85
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,750
Let us do this.

86
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,790
Do you have two tens?

87
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,590
Then take it. I have...

88
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
Two nines.

89
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,916
Wait, please.

90
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,440
Give me one more chance.

91
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,280
What chance? You're out of money.

92
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,210
Can you please give me a small cut?

93
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,096
Lord Seong, why are you being so clingy?

94
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,456
You said, "Born empty handed,
die empty handed."

95
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,426
This has happened too many times!

96
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,020
Must you clean us out all the time?

97
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,106
What kind of joy do you think
I have in my life?

98
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,790
This is all I get.

99
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,630
Do not embarrass me and stand up.

100
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,300
Eunuch Kim, what is your secret?

101
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,670
My secret...

102
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,016
After I lost my manhood,

103
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,386
I also lost fear.

104
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,410
That may be my secret.

105
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,397
I apologize.

106
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:42,520
No need.

107
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,730
You! Make some noise when you come in.

108
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,806
Did you hear the news?

109
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,570
News? What news?

110
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,176
Actually,

111
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,520
it seems something happened
to the Head of Special Advisor.

112
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,356
But the Head of Special Advisor
is a royal secret...

113
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,156
Be careful with what you say.

114
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,980
Everyone already knows this.
Why make a fuss?

115
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,020
Tell us more.

116
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,626
Apparently,
he has not reported for a month.

117
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,220
What could be the reason?

118
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,760
I sincerely hope we meet again.

119
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
He was a great man.

120
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,070
Every royal agent has been killed.

121
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,940
Did you witness it for yourself?

122
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,980
Why are you attacking me?

123
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,180
Lord Seong, calm yourself.

124
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,290
I will see you again soon.

125
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,930
Did I win too much money?

126
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,530
Sir, you're back.

127
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,970
Did you win any money tonight?

128
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,240
You lost again?

129
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,486
Let's have some dinner.

130
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,956
Sir, I have something to show you.

131
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,110
Please come inside.

132
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,266
Sir, there's a fantastic new book out.

133
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,560
Fantastic?

134
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,530
Ta-da.

135
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,636
Erotic novels are all the same.

136
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,900
This one is completely different.

137
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,276
What's so different about it?

138
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,040
First of all, the plot is very shocking.

139
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,016
It is about a secret romance in the palace
with a court lady and eunuchs,

140
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,380
and I mean with multiple eunuchs.

141
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,550
Eunuchs and a court lady?

142
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,336
How is that possible, you idiot!

143
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,960
They'd be executed by dismemberment.

144
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,930
That's why it's so exciting.

145
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,876
Think about it.

146
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,210
Every eunuch in the palace
will die for a copy.

147
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,170
Eunuchs?

148
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,336
I hear you acquired a new novel.

149
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,600
The plot is quite shocking,
never-before-seen.

150
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,370
The last one was boring and disappointing.

151
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,240
I will take a look.

152
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Here.

153
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
Whoa.

154
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,686
How many of these do you have?

155
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,986
Ten volumes.

156
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,380
Two brass coins per volume, twenty total.

157
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Twenty.

158
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
No thank you.

159
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,356
Wait, just wait for a moment.

160
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,520
Give me a chance to finish.

161
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,866
It was twenty coins,
but come to think of it,

162
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,830
what joy would you have in life?

163
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,300
I will give them to you for ten coins.

164
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Ten?

165
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,776
I need at least that much

166
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,110
to take my colleagues to a courtesan house
and treat them to drinks.

167
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,180
Don't you think?

168
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Fine.

169
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,580
Take them out.

170
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,996
What could the chief royal secretary
Jang Taeseung have said to His Majesty?

171
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,066
They seem to work in perfect harmony.

172
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,776
Father, if Park Cheolgyu
is in fact in trouble,

173
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,176
we must hold the chief royal secretary
responsible.

174
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,486
He is right.
Before we locate Park Cheolgyu,

175
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,270
we cannot continue
the royal agent system.

176
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,950
No, we must observe for now.

177
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,450
What is your plan, Father?

178
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,096
When catching a big fish,

179
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,096
pulling prematurely to start a tug of war

180
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,536
will only help the fish break free.

181
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,930
But if you wait
until the fish grows weak...

182
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,900
The fish will jump into your basket,
demanding to be eaten.

183
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,726
I have a special event
planned for you tonight.

184
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,010
You do?

185
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,120
Come in.

186
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,770
Have you heard?

187
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,716
There's a new courtesan
named Honglang,

188
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,440
and apparently, every time she moves,
she leaves a scent of opium poppies.

189
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,980
What do you mean? Opium poppies?

190
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,590
It means she totally hypnotizes people.

191
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,356
That was good.

192
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,320
Let me pour you a drink.

193
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,296
So, what is your name?

194
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,267
My name is...

195
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,689
Honglang, where are you? Honglang!

196
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,060
What is all the noise?

197
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,530
Forgive me. Please excuse me for a moment.

198
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,500
Honglang!

199
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,170
I will show you what fun is.

200
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,110
Let go of me!

201
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,596
Why won't you accept my heart?

202
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Who else could love you
more than I do in all of Joseon?

203
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,170
Fine.

204
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,850
If you refuse to accept my love,

205
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,790
I will die here.

206
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,160
Go ahead.

207
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,970
Well, Honglang...

208
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,850
I mean, there's no need...

209
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,856
I do not intend to accept your love,

210
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,210
so do stab yourself.

211
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,396
Hey! You think I can't do it?

212
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,490
I think you can do it.

213
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,090
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead.

214
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,160
Well, I was aiming for the knife.

215
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,530
Lord Seong,
where did you learn to do that?

216
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,410
For a courtesan, you are brazen.

217
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,310
You think you have power
over a person's life?

218
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,826
You saved a person from killing himself,

219
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,120
so it seems you have that power, my lord.

220
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,326
- What?
- You wasted your energy.

221
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,326
He never had the nerve to do it.

222
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,220
Insolence!
How dare you talk back to me?

223
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,200
If I was presumptuous, I apologize.

224
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,100
However, was I
the only one presumptuous?

225
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,746
Ha! Your high and mighty manners

226
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,970
tell me there is a powerful man
behind you.

227
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,616
Tell me.

228
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,110
Who is he?

229
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,280
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

230
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,790
But I mean, to support me...

231
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,620
He must be someone higher
than an assistant advisor.

232
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,790
Excuse me.

233
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,730
Why you...

234
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,800
Hwang Jini's beauty
with Nongae's spirit...

235
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,370
She sure is hypnotizing.

236
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,310
That girl... She's Honglang?

237
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,850
What? "He must be someone higher
than an assistant advisor?"

238
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,820
Where is Honglang?

239
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,906
Why does everyone want Honglang?

240
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,176
Be quiet. Go and get Honglang.

241
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,640
My lord, she is of another class.

242
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,210
High enough to look down
on an assistant advisor?

243
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,817
Go and bring her.

244
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,356
We're unable to do it,

245
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,880
so if you are desperate to see her,
get her yourself.

246
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,250
I need workers outside the city.

247
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,596
I want to buy some slaves at the market.

248
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,020
The market?

249
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,466
You mean the slave market?

250
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,236
But that is illegal.

251
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,660
Illegal...

252
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,300
That's true for those governed by the law.

253
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,740
Why do you insist
on using the slave market?

254
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,570
That way, no one will care
even if they die.

255
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,880
Now, enough about work.
Let us enjoy our drinks.

256
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,610
Yes.

257
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,830
Who are you?

258
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,880
I heard of your presence
and came to pay my respects.

259
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,650
I am Seong Igyeom, an assistant advisor
of the Office of Special Advisors.

260
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,320
Oh, there is no need
to pay me your respect here.

261
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,836
Enjoy yourself and go home.

262
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,760
Yes, Lord Kim. Please excuse me.

263
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,676
My lord, he came here
to pay his respects to you.

264
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,970
Don't be so haste in sending him away.

265
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,310
How about pouring him a drink?

266
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,280
Yes, you are right.

267
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,156
Come here and have a drink.

268
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Pardon me?

269
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,590
Yes, thank you.

270
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,140
Really? Good idea.

271
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,080
He's good!

272
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,060
He is quite talented.

273
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,730
That is enough.

274
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,746
Heaven was definitely on my side tonight

275
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,470
to have the privilege of serving you.

276
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,540
Your name is Honglang, you said?

277
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,150
That is correct.

278
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,950
I will return to see you.

279
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,830
Let us go.

280
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,130
Goodnight.

281
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,630
Goodnight. Goodnight.

282
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Goodnight.

283
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,510
Why don't you go home now?

284
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,820
Honglang!

285
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,690
How dare you toy with me?

286
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,300
You had all the fun, so what do you mean?

287
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,170
What?

288
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,670
Stop right there!

289
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,976
Where are you going?

290
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,240
Come back here!

291
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,110
Hey! How dare you? Let go of me!

292
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,010
I refuse to be humiliated like this!

293
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Let him go.

294
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,130
My lord.

295
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,100
What is this?

296
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,630
This way.

297
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,880
My lord, tonight is not the only night.

298
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,580
It is late so do come back another night.

299
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,850
And I will serve you all night long.

300
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,620
All... Night long?

301
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,890
So, goodnight for now.

302
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,370
Why that wicked girl...

303
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,990
So what did you hear tonight?

304
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,836
Is there a slave market in town?

305
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,906
A slave market?

306
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:41,100
Yes, Kim Byeonggeun said
he needs slave workers outside the city.

307
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Outside the city?

308
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
For what purpose?

309
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,110
That... I did not hear.

310
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,810
A scoundrel interrupted.

311
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,656
What scoundrel?

312
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,040
He's an assistant advisor
of the Office of Special Advisors.

313
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,020
An assistant advisor...

314
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,536
Was it... Seong Igyeom?

315
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,736
Yes, it was he.

316
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,667
What did he do?

317
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,560
I was looked down for being a courtesan,
so I taught him a lesson.

318
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,020
Indiscipline is getting to be
a problem in the palace.

319
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,700
Keep a close eye on Kim Byeonggeun.

320
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,940
He is plotting something.

321
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,156
He will return to the courtesan house.

322
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,980
I will find out everything then,
so do not worry.

323
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,026
Yes, good job.

324
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,880
You should return.

325
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,296
Haven't you forgotten anything?

326
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,020
What?

327
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,240
Since there was nothing special tonight...

328
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,410
This won't even cover
the traveling expenses.

329
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,326
The amount of information
was never an issue.

330
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,796
You can't keep doing this.

331
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,726
Don't be greedy
when you have nowhere to spend it.

332
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,396
I do have places to spend money.

333
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,320
You can do anything with money.

334
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Enough?

335
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,710
You can be very petty sometimes.

336
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,786
Petty?

337
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,910
How dare you say such a thing?

338
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,426
Dain, haven't I taught you manners?

339
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,696
There you go again.

340
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm leaving.

341
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,750
You are back.

342
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

343
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,530
I found this at the place
Park Cheolgyu was staying.

344
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,630
What is this?

345
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,916
It was the journal he kept
for seogye and byeoldan.

346
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,546
[Seogye: A report the official writes
after fulfilling the king's order]

347
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,116
[Byeoldan: A local civil affairs report,
which includes the names of residents]

348
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
A journal?

349
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,326
Kang Inchung, the sheriff of this place,
has been overtaxing the residents.

350
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,496
Those who are unable to pay the taxes

351
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,590
must send their children
to do hard labor or sell them as slaves.

352
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,730
Many have grown used
to the sheriff's tyranny and extortion.

353
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,800
His maddening tyranny must be put to stop.

354
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,110
Find me a new royal secret agent quickly.

355
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,026
I need someone new and reliable.

356
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,660
Moreover, he mustn't be connected
to the local government officials.

357
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,860
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

358
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:16,357
Oh, you are alive!

359
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:19,957
Where did you go last night?

360
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:23,457
Did you enjoy a passionate night
with Honglang?

361
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:27,203
A passionate night?

362
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:29,737
Lord Seong, is that true?

363
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,907
Don't even start.

364
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:40,123
That girl, Honglang,
totally toyed with me.

365
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:41,147
Toyed...

366
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,807
It was that good?

367
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:44,977
Tell us more.

368
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:50,827
Oh, let us not talk about it.

369
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:53,244
Why not?

370
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,143
Why not? Tell us!

371
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:55,944
What happened?

372
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:58,243
I will give you two coins.

373
00:30:58,267 --> 00:30:59,477
Yes, please.

374
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:04,907
Honglang was...

375
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:09,747
Of another class.

376
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:14,587
Another class?

377
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:16,987
How so?

378
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:25,837
Welcome. What are you looking for?

379
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:28,807
I am looking for a man.

380
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:33,037
I hear you are
one of the best in the field.

381
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:37,783
I just go lurk around
asking people questions

382
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,877
and gather bits and pieces
of useful information.

383
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,347
So, who are you looking for?

384
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:48,293
I want to find

385
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:50,727
a man who worked in Seonjeonkwan.

386
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,697
In Seonjeonkwan...

387
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,327
That will be 50 coins.

388
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:00,367
What did you say?

389
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:02,983
Fifty coins for finding a man?

390
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:07,377
I must look into
the government records for this.

391
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:12,547
And they are top secret documents
to which only chroniclers have access to.

392
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:17,747
I will need to bribe a chronicler
for information, no?

393
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,327
Fine. How long do you need?

394
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:24,727
Five days will be enough.

395
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:32,667
I will pay you the rest
when you get me the information.

396
00:32:39,507 --> 00:32:42,177
There is no one, not a single man.

397
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:43,183
[Assistant Royal Guard Choi Dogwan]

398
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:45,547
Of all the men in the government,

399
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,693
there is not a single man.

400
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,093
A special person always appears
at the most unexpected place,

401
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:55,687
so why not take a step back
and widen your search?

402
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:57,287
Yes.

403
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:58,997
I should go.

404
00:33:11,537 --> 00:33:14,577
There is an officer working this late?

405
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:19,077
I fold.

406
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:20,977
I also fold.

407
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:24,247
Me also.

408
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,757
You cannot all fold.

409
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:30,263
And let us try smiling.

410
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,103
We're doing this for entertainment, no?

411
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:33,527
Stop talking and start dealing.

412
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:35,567
Put them back in here.

413
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:43,167
Hurry up and pick.

414
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:02,236
By the way, did you hear the rumor
about the search for a new royal agent?

415
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:05,027
Whoever it may be,
he is an unlucky bastard.

416
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:08,157
What if you end up being picked?

417
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:09,457
Me?

418
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:10,997
Ten coins for me.

419
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,007
The chief royal secretary is not mad.

420
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:23,253
They only pick the cleanest
and the most inflexible men

421
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:25,247
to be the royal secret agents.

422
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:27,797
I will see your ten coins and...

423
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:34,586
I'm going all-in.

424
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:38,387
I fold.

425
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:41,057
I also fold.

426
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:44,697
I am getting a bad feeling.

427
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:49,213
Fine. Born empty handed,
die empty handed, right?

428
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:50,267
I'm also going all-in.

429
00:34:52,977 --> 00:34:55,137
I am getting a feeling of deja vu.

430
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:59,733
A royal secret agent should have
a mind as crafty as yours,

431
00:34:59,757 --> 00:35:01,047
don't you agree?

432
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:04,047
True.

433
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:07,717
Here comes a crafty man.

434
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,287
Two nines.

435
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:16,197
If you have two tens, take them.

436
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,713
You look pale.

437
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:21,197
Do you have two eights?

438
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:25,637
Oh, he has two eights!

439
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:31,247
I did it, I did it!

440
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:33,817
I did it.

441
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:49,197
I offer my congratulations.

442
00:35:53,037 --> 00:35:54,113
Guard Choi.

443
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:55,137
Yes.

444
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:58,877
Take these men
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

445
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,814
Yes, Lord Jang!

446
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:01,907
Come with me!

447
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:03,907
Now!

448
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:05,347
No...

449
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,787
It was my first win... Dang it.

450
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:16,177
Here are the reports on Seong Igyeom
you've requested.

451
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:21,503
He is from Chungcheong-do,
and his father Seong Yongjae

452
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:24,673
resigned from his chief position
of the Office of Censors

453
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:28,197
and taught students
at a school in his hometown.

454
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:31,543
Holding the position of the chief censor
of the Office of Censors

455
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,007
means he had
both knowledge and experience.

456
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,947
Ten years ago...

457
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:45,517
Prince Hwiyeong might have been
the reason why.

458
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:51,003
Many government officials were persecuted

459
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:53,427
because of their connection
to Prince Hwiyeong.

460
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:57,703
Does he have any other family members?

461
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:02,167
His wife was ill and died giving birth
to their son Seong Igyeom.

462
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,583
And he has a half-brother

463
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:06,687
who is a low ranking official
at a government office.

464
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:10,847
Seong Igyeom currently
lives alone in Hanyang with a servant.

465
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:12,777
Shall I search his home?

466
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:17,063
There is no need.

467
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:19,117
I think I found the man.

468
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:32,697
The promotion evaluation is near,
so this is a tragedy.

469
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:37,867
I used to never gamble.

470
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:40,337
How about me?

471
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:43,647
I lived my whole life in abstinence.

472
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:47,047
Just who asked me to do this?

473
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:52,733
Be glad we are not
in solitary confinement.

474
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:54,693
Corruption within the palace
means aggravated punishment.

475
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:57,627
You knew that and still got us involved?

476
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:02,667
Eunuch Kim!
You won the most money!

477
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,443
He is right!

478
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,737
Eunuch Kim!

479
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:10,507
Criminal Seong Igyeom, come out.

480
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,647
Did you call for me?

481
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,787
Assistant Advisor Seong Igyeom.

482
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:29,727
Yes.

483
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:33,457
You're a little rascal.

484
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,427
I will pay for my sins.

485
00:38:37,597 --> 00:38:39,943
Do you admit your sins?

486
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:43,207
I have neither a sponsor nor connections,
so what else could I do?

487
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:45,937
I must pay for it on my own.

488
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:48,477
Fine.

489
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:52,177
I will send you outside the palace.

490
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,157
Pay for your sins
by becoming a royal secret agent.

491
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:04,233
Pardon? A royal secret agent?

492
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:05,257
Quiet.

493
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:10,267
I am not the right man for it.

494
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:16,037
The decision is not up to you.

495
00:39:18,837 --> 00:39:20,553
Lock him up in solitary for now.

496
00:39:20,577 --> 00:39:21,577
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

497
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:23,907
But...

498
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:30,917
How can I send a man like him
as my agent?

499
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:35,957
I served as a proctor of the state exam
a few years ago.

500
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:40,497
There was an answer sheet
that moved me.

501
00:39:41,627 --> 00:39:44,573
When you read the answer,

502
00:39:44,597 --> 00:39:47,497
you did not hesitate from giving
the highest mark.

503
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:49,967
What was it about?

504
00:39:50,837 --> 00:39:53,977
It was a passionate critique
on the corrupt and disloyal officials.

505
00:39:55,037 --> 00:39:56,507
Do you remember?

506
00:39:57,407 --> 00:40:00,723
Yes... I do.

507
00:40:00,747 --> 00:40:02,247
It deserved the highest mark.

508
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:07,357
Seong Igyeom was the man who wrote it.

509
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:08,687
Is that true?

510
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:13,727
But... how did such a promising young man
change so much?

511
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:15,943
I do not know the reason,

512
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:18,273
but I do think it might be impossible
to find a man

513
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:20,137
who is perfect.

514
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:24,113
Seong Igyeom is in jail,
so even if he disappeared,

515
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:27,207
no one will find out he was dispatched
as a royal secret agent.

516
00:40:30,577 --> 00:40:32,217
What do you need me to do?

517
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,197
Open your eyes.

518
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,467
I will listen so talk.

519
00:40:53,897 --> 00:40:57,007
Insolence! Show proper respect!

520
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:11,417
Lift your head.

521
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:18,957
You look familiar...

522
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:26,967
Your Majesty!

523
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:29,867
Your Majesty!

524
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:32,637
Your Majesty!

525
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:36,207
Your Majesty.

526
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,647
You and I share the same fate.

527
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:42,647
Pardon me? I do not understand...

528
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,563
I may be king,

529
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,117
but I am imprisoned.

530
00:41:50,587 --> 00:41:55,473
Those who say they're my loyal servants
have covered my eyes and ears.

531
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:58,297
They wish for me to remain oblivious
to what is happening in the world.

532
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:04,437
The only people I can trust in this palace

533
00:42:06,677 --> 00:42:08,947
are the chief royal secretary
and my secret agents.

534
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:16,017
Will you be my eyes and ears?

535
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:22,287
Your Majesty!

536
00:42:22,827 --> 00:42:25,063
I am but a lowly man.

537
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:28,357
I dare not be your eyes and ears.

538
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,943
Give me your trust.

539
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,337
I will give you the power you need.

540
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:39,467
Free him.

541
00:42:49,287 --> 00:42:50,287
Your Majesty!

542
00:43:05,737 --> 00:43:09,137
From this moment on,
you are my royal secret agent.

543
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:14,207
Your Majesty...

544
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,657
I will give you three days
until your dispatch.

545
00:43:26,557 --> 00:43:29,303
Recuperate and sort your affairs,

546
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:31,927
but no one outside must know about this.

547
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:42,337
Return home and read this.

548
00:43:43,107 --> 00:43:44,567
That is Park Cheolgyu's journal.

549
00:43:54,817 --> 00:43:57,787
Oh, man.

550
00:44:15,707 --> 00:44:20,483
I met a courtesan named Sawol
and learned something new.

551
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:23,247
Dongsu... Dongsu...

552
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:26,573
I have decided
to postpone my appearance

553
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,277
and investigate further.

554
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:37,363
What did Park Cheolgyu learn
from the courtesan?

555
00:44:37,387 --> 00:44:38,597
Chief Royal Secretary.

556
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:46,497
I hear you have your hands full.

557
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:48,343
Thank you for your concern.

558
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:50,713
Did you find a man to be
the next royal agent?

559
00:44:50,737 --> 00:44:52,483
It is not an easy task.

560
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:53,837
I am sure.

561
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:58,447
If there is no other,
why not take the job yourself?

562
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:03,587
I would love to,
but who will look after His Majesty?

563
00:45:04,817 --> 00:45:08,733
Are you implying I and other officials
are not looking after His Majesty?

564
00:45:08,757 --> 00:45:11,263
Oh, if it sounded like that, I apologize.

565
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:12,763
Please do not misunderstand.

566
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:15,173
Haven't you hear the rumors?

567
00:45:15,197 --> 00:45:19,443
That you send the men His Majesty trusts
as royal agents

568
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,967
to secure your own position.

569
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:24,307
That is not true.

570
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:28,183
People's lives are growing harder,

571
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:31,623
but the government is preoccupied
with the royal agent issue.

572
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:34,047
I am concerned about
where the blame will fall.

573
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:38,893
You must show
your concern for the people

574
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:41,757
at the courtesan's house as well.

575
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:45,447
I have work to do, so please excuse me.

576
00:45:47,057 --> 00:45:48,497
Why that...

577
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:52,467
The courtesan house? How did he know?

578
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:56,543
Keep an eye on Chief Royal Secretary

579
00:45:56,567 --> 00:46:00,183
and find how whom he meets
and who visits his house.

580
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:01,207
Yes, Father.

581
00:46:14,217 --> 00:46:15,217
Are you in?

582
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:21,827
Did you find the person?

583
00:46:35,707 --> 00:46:37,177
I must be at the wrong place.

584
00:46:38,077 --> 00:46:39,647
I will come back another time.

585
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:41,377
Cease her.

586
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,317
Why are you doing this?

587
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:46,563
What is happening?

588
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:49,127
I think you have the wrong person.

589
00:46:49,857 --> 00:46:53,103
Please let me talk
to the Chief Royal Secretary.

590
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:54,033
I have something to tell him.

591
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:55,057
Be quiet!

592
00:47:06,877 --> 00:47:09,207
Just a moment, please.

593
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:11,583
I have a favor to ask.

594
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:14,953
Please tell the Chief Royal Secretary

595
00:47:14,977 --> 00:47:16,617
that Dain is in jail.

596
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:28,697
I really shouldn't.

597
00:47:29,297 --> 00:47:30,897
That's more expensive than you think.

598
00:47:44,307 --> 00:47:47,177
I am a royal secret agent.

599
00:47:51,617 --> 00:47:53,957
I am Seong Igyeom, a royal secret agent.

600
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:57,957
That sounds wrong.

601
00:47:59,957 --> 00:48:00,934
You fool!

602
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,227
Do you know who I am?

603
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:06,097
Me? You're asking about me?

604
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:12,177
I am a royal secret agent.

605
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:20,277
This is maddening.
A royal secret agent...

606
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:32,497
Have you no fear?

607
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:36,367
How dare you try to look at the records
by bribing a chronicler?

608
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:41,737
Come with me.

609
00:48:48,537 --> 00:48:49,577
Hostess!

610
00:48:50,247 --> 00:48:52,353
Go and get Honglang!

611
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:53,723
Oh, geez.

612
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:55,423
Honglang, Honglang.

613
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:57,447
Oh, that darn Honglang.

614
00:48:58,117 --> 00:49:01,487
If you keep this up, I must report you
to the government office.

615
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:05,257
What? Report me?

616
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:09,127
Unbelievable.

617
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:11,427
Do you know who I am?

618
00:49:12,597 --> 00:49:14,273
How would I know that?

619
00:49:14,297 --> 00:49:15,467
I am!

620
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:22,377
It's a secret.

621
00:49:28,847 --> 00:49:31,017
I know who he is.
He is a madman.

622
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:34,963
Sir, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

623
00:49:34,987 --> 00:49:35,863
Chunsam.

624
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:36,887
Oh, you reek.

625
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:38,733
Just how much did you drink?

626
00:49:38,757 --> 00:49:40,473
Stand up. We must go.

627
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:42,027
We must.

628
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,297
What?

629
00:49:45,397 --> 00:49:46,837
Wait.

630
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:49,507
You must pay first.

631
00:49:58,277 --> 00:49:59,277
Chunsam.

632
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:01,017
Yes, sir.

633
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:05,087
Thank you. I've done nothing for you,

634
00:50:05,557 --> 00:50:07,217
but you're always good to me.

635
00:50:08,117 --> 00:50:10,263
Don't mention it, sir.

636
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:13,903
All I ask for is to serve one master

637
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,527
until the day I die.

638
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,473
Wherever you go,

639
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:21,467
I will be with you.

640
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:23,713
So I was thinking, Chunsam.

641
00:50:23,737 --> 00:50:24,737
Yes?

642
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:28,747
I am a royal secret agent.

643
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:34,077
A royal secret agent?

644
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,647
Yes.

645
00:50:37,087 --> 00:50:40,017
Now you are a part
of the royal agent's entourage.

646
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:46,997
Do you mean I will be leaving with you?

647
00:50:47,897 --> 00:50:48,897
That is correct.

648
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:52,337
The royal agent's entourage...

649
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:56,537
I have always dreamed

650
00:50:57,007 --> 00:50:59,483
of escaping this tiresome servant's life

651
00:50:59,507 --> 00:51:02,047
and living a new one!

652
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:04,424
But you just said you...

653
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:05,917
A servant! A servant!

654
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:10,363
But now I'm a part
of the royal agent's entourage.

655
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:11,887
Isn't that just wonderful?

656
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:14,887
Park Chunsam
is in the royal agent's entourage.

657
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:19,034
Are you that happy?

658
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:20,857
Of course. It's fantastic.

659
00:51:21,797 --> 00:51:22,873
Make way!

660
00:51:22,897 --> 00:51:24,997
Here comes the royal secret agent!

661
00:51:28,537 --> 00:51:32,107
If Lady Sunae knew about this,
she would be happy.

662
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:33,607
Sunae...

663
00:51:37,907 --> 00:51:39,277
What did you just say?

664
00:51:40,747 --> 00:51:43,763
I did not say Sunae.

665
00:51:43,787 --> 00:51:45,263
No, no, no!

666
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:46,887
How dare he.

667
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:49,887
Are you out of your mind?

668
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:53,657
Why did you do such a thing?

669
00:51:54,497 --> 00:51:59,013
I want to avenge the death of my parents
for they were innocent.

670
00:51:59,037 --> 00:52:01,537
That will only put your life at risk.

671
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:05,137
Leave this place tomorrow.

672
00:52:06,077 --> 00:52:08,683
Pardon me? Leave?

673
00:52:08,707 --> 00:52:11,607
A royal secret agent will be dispatched
tomorrow morning.

674
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:15,717
Join the royal agent's entourage
and take part in his secret mission.

675
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:21,017
Sir, how can I support the royal agent
when I am a woman?

676
00:52:21,357 --> 00:52:22,857
That is why I am sending you.

677
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:27,097
It is something only you can do
so go with him and help him.

678
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:29,897
It's something only I can do?

679
00:52:36,437 --> 00:52:40,907
What will I get in return?

680
00:52:41,177 --> 00:52:43,077
Are you trying to make a deal with me?

681
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:50,647
Fine. How much do you want this time?

682
00:52:52,017 --> 00:52:53,457
The man I'm looking for...

683
00:52:54,517 --> 00:52:55,063
please find out who the official was.

684
00:52:55,087 --> 00:52:57,857
[Seonjeonkwan: Government officials
that deliver king's orders]

685
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:05,613
How dare you!

686
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:07,497
Chunsam? Is that you?

687
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,183
Sir? Sir? Sir!

688
00:53:11,207 --> 00:53:12,513
Chunsam! Chunsam!

689
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:14,753
Sir, sir!

690
00:53:14,777 --> 00:53:16,353
Sir, are you hurt?

691
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:18,053
I'm fine. How about you?

692
00:53:18,077 --> 00:53:19,547
I'm fine too.

693
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:23,087
But what is going on?

694
00:53:24,347 --> 00:53:25,993
Chunsam is dying here!

695
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:26,833
Stop crying.

696
00:53:26,857 --> 00:53:27,834
Chunsam!

697
00:53:27,858 --> 00:53:29,287
Stop crying, Park Chunsam!

698
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:32,557
Calm down.

699
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:35,497
There is only one way we can get out.

700
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,227
We must find the door.

701
00:53:38,027 --> 00:53:39,027
The door?

702
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,767
Chunsam, stand up.

703
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:46,077
Use your body to feel things.

704
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,083
Feel things? Feel things.

705
00:53:48,107 --> 00:53:49,147
Up and down.

706
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:52,977
Right and left.

707
00:53:59,757 --> 00:54:01,387
Who's there?

708
00:54:02,427 --> 00:54:03,787
My foot!

709
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:22,883
This is the door.

710
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:23,907
Come this way.

711
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:25,977
Where? Where?

712
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:30,417
Sir? Sir!

713
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:37,403
It's me, Chunsam.

714
00:54:37,427 --> 00:54:39,227
Chunsam, Chunsam.

715
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:40,857
Back up.

716
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:45,413
Now, we much charge full speed
towards the door.

717
00:54:45,437 --> 00:54:47,113
Yes, got it.

718
00:54:47,137 --> 00:54:49,337
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

719
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:53,707
Are you still here?

720
00:54:54,437 --> 00:54:55,324
You are still here?

721
00:54:55,348 --> 00:54:57,083
You coward.

722
00:54:57,107 --> 00:54:58,953
We will do this for real this time.

723
00:54:58,977 --> 00:54:59,753
One!

724
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:00,553
Two!

725
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:01,577
- Three!
- Three!

726
00:55:05,217 --> 00:55:06,757
What was that sound?

727
00:55:08,587 --> 00:55:09,587
I am not sure.

728
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:11,663
Was it a thunder?

729
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:12,687
Pardon me?

730
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:14,257
Let us go.

731
00:55:17,797 --> 00:55:19,473
Sir, sir, we are out!

732
00:55:19,497 --> 00:55:21,137
Who are they?

733
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:24,507
They're nobodies.
Don't worry about them.

734
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:28,953
You messed with the wrong man!

735
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:32,517
The man here is the royal secret agent!

736
00:55:33,077 --> 00:55:34,877
I am the royal secret agent!

737
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:36,447
You!

738
00:55:39,457 --> 00:55:42,787
That is the royal secret agent?

739
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:45,233
How dare you!

740
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:46,003
Cowards!

741
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:46,903
No.

742
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:47,927
Go.

743
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:50,667
Who's there?

744
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:53,173
You cowards!

745
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:54,467
You!

746
00:56:08,947 --> 00:56:13,557
His Majesty warned you
not to reveal your identity!

747
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:17,703
I hear you drank at the tavern
during midday

748
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:19,397
and caused a scene at the market.

749
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:22,707
That was why I ordered you
to be apprehended and locked in the shed.

750
00:56:23,197 --> 00:56:24,197
I apologize, sir.

751
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:26,473
Had this happened while you were
dispatched as a royal agent,

752
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:28,113
you could have put

753
00:56:28,137 --> 00:56:31,637
His Majesty in danger on top of your life,
can't you see that?

754
00:56:35,477 --> 00:56:36,677
I deserve to be put to death.

755
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:39,923
No, sir.

756
00:56:39,947 --> 00:56:42,923
This is my fault for not looking
after my master properly.

757
00:56:42,947 --> 00:56:44,287
Please put me to death.

758
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:46,817
What could I accomplish by killing you?

759
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:51,857
One more person will join you
on your secret mission.

760
00:56:52,727 --> 00:56:55,467
You leave at dawn. Go home.

761
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:10,307
She left the Chief Royal Secretary's house
and went to the courtesan house?

762
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:12,917
Did you see who it was?

763
00:57:13,817 --> 00:57:17,517
It was the courtesan who came out
to see you off last time.

764
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:19,557
She saw you off?

765
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,927
That was Honglang.

766
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:25,457
She must have acted as a spy.

767
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:29,097
Bring her here in the morning.

768
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:30,527
Yes, sir!

769
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:36,367
Make way! Make way!

770
00:57:36,507 --> 00:57:39,237
Make way! Make way!

771
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:51,893
Bring out all the courtesans inside!

772
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:52,917
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

773
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:26,017
Wait!

774
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:35,397
Have you seen the courtesan
named Honglang?

775
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:37,897
I have not.

776
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:48,677
Stop right there!

777
00:58:51,507 --> 00:58:53,047
What is this about?

778
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:05,833
You may fool my eyes,

779
00:59:05,857 --> 00:59:07,757
but you cannot fool my noise.

780
00:59:12,597 --> 00:59:13,637
Honglang.

781
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:20,277
Get her!

782
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:51,284
[Open and read after passing Namdaemun]

783
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:54,607
Where you must go and what you must do
are written in detail inside.

784
00:59:55,347 --> 00:59:59,147
And there will be a person
waiting for you at the gate.

785
01:00:00,717 --> 01:00:02,423
Who is it?

786
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:03,787
At least give me the name.

787
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:06,417
The name is Hong Dain.

788
01:00:08,827 --> 01:00:09,957
Hong... Dain?

789
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:13,673
From this moment on,
you are a royal secret agent.

790
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,227
Do not forget your duty.

791
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:18,767
Yes, Lord Jang.

792
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:29,847
Make way!

793
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:31,447
Clear the way!

794
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:44,957
Sir, the man named Hong Dain
must be running late.

795
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:48,427
Insolence... How dare he make
the royal secret agent wait?

796
01:01:02,947 --> 01:01:04,977
Sir, that must be him. Over there.

797
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:07,647
So he must know that he's late.

798
01:01:12,187 --> 01:01:15,463
Are you the man
the Chief Royal Secretary sent?

799
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:18,057
Yes, I am Hong Dain...

800
01:01:22,427 --> 01:01:24,043
The scoundrel?

801
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:25,597
What? Scoundrel?

802
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:30,107
You look very...

803
01:01:31,907 --> 01:01:34,807
It's you! Honglang?

804
01:01:36,177 --> 01:01:38,817
So, you are the royal secret agent?

805
01:01:40,517 --> 01:01:41,647
You... You!

806
01:01:44,747 --> 01:01:46,487
There she is. Get her!

807
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,540
[Royal Secret Agent]

808
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:28,025
This is the place.

809
01:02:28,105 --> 01:02:29,335
It seems nothing special.

810
01:02:29,425 --> 01:02:30,671
We'll find out after investigating.

811
01:02:30,695 --> 01:02:31,574
Who is that?

812
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,171
You don't know the Junior Police Chief?

813
01:02:33,195 --> 01:02:34,295
What is "Junior Chief"?

814
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,815
He's the son of the Chief of Police.

815
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:37,885
In this city,
the Junior Chief of Police is king.

816
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:40,435
Special Counsel
investigates father and son.

817
01:02:40,515 --> 01:02:42,445
They must be hiding something.

818
01:02:42,535 --> 01:02:43,715
I need concrete evidence.

819
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,141
You learned something from Sa-wol?

820
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:46,925
You're Sa-wol, right?

821
01:02:47,005 --> 01:02:49,831
When he saw the son of the Chief of
Police, he shivered with fear and ran away.

822
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,785
There must be a reason.

823
