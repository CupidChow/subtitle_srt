1
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:15,253
Sawol!

2
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:16,993
Sawol!

3
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,593
Sawol, Sawol.

4
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:22,840
Who's there?

5
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,103
Stay with me, Sawol.

6
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:29,473
My baby... Save my baby, please.

7
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,083
Sawol.

8
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,153
Wake up, Sawol!

9
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:45,793
Sawol. Sawol!

10
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:47,793
Sir!

11
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:05,573
Is anyone there? Open this door!

12
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,383
We need help!

13
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,383
Who's there?

14
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:15,523
What is the matter?

15
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,053
There is no time!

16
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,933
She has lost too much blood.

17
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:34,933
If we remove the arrow, she may die.

18
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:45,313
Please save my baby.

19
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,453
Go and bring the midwife.

20
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:51,759
The amniotic sac has ruptured.

21
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:53,113
She is in labor.

22
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:54,830
There's no time.

23
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:57,053
She cannot give birth in this state.

24
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,829
Neither the mother
nor the baby will survive.

25
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,593
Then are you going to just sit and watch?

26
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:07,993
Sawol, the baby is coming.

27
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,133
You must hang in there.

28
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:12,703
What are you doing?

29
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,948
I will assist her with childbirth.
Help me get prepared.

30
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,103
Can you do it?

31
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,673
I have never tried it,
but I have assisted before.

32
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:24,113
Fine.

33
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:32,653
Sawol, hang in there.

34
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,233
Not yet. Push!

35
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,503
Push a little bit harder.

36
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:58,213
Please... Bury me in that place.

37
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,722
The baby is coming.

38
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,163
Just a little bit more.

39
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:16,563
Sawol.

40
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:20,173
It is here.

41
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:22,303
Sawol.

42
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,943
Sawol, it is a boy.

43
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:34,813
Sawol, what did you see?

44
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,323
Why did you take us there?

45
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:42,853
Sawol.

46
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,583
Sawol.

47
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,659
Sawol.

48
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:13,599
Wake up, Sawol.

49
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:14,269
Sawol!

50
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,293
Sawol!

51
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:18,893
Sawol...

52
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:35,513
I share no responsibility
for this woman's death.

53
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:37,943
This woman was murdered.

54
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,603
That is something you must report
to the government office.

55
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:42,923
We need your help.

56
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:47,623
I understand.

57
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:52,493
It will be daybreak soon so come with me
to the government office.

58
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,693
Thank you.

59
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:09,083
It's already midday, so where are they?

60
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,429
What if they got into trouble again?

61
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:14,629
They haven't returned?

62
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:15,360
No.

63
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:16,823
I wonder why.

64
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:20,193
His Majesty will be furious.

65
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,863
I'm the only one
who is fulfilling his duty.

66
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,809
- I need to go out for a while.
- Sure.

67
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,093
- I'll help you later.
- Sure.

68
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,673
What? Why are they back?

69
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,773
Those darn men.

70
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,103
You!

71
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:39,643
You!

72
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:44,213
You! I warned you
never to show your face here again!

73
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,589
Actually...

74
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:46,653
Be quiet!

75
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:49,483
What happened?

76
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,369
It is nothing.

77
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,393
They were asking about you.

78
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,240
Me?

79
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:57,293
Yes.

80
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:01,593
Sheriff ordered us to bring you
with utmost care.

81
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:03,603
Sheriff?

82
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,973
No. Never!

83
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,349
Sir.

84
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,673
- Sir.
- Sir.

85
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:14,019
If we fail to bring you,

86
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:16,243
we're all dead meat.

87
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:42,749
So, why did you

88
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:45,589
summon that courtesan late at night?

89
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,589
I did not summon her.
She paid me a visit.

90
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:51,383
This courtesan visited you? Why?

91
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:54,459
She was about to tell me

92
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,383
when an arrow flew in and hit her.

93
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,723
An arrow flew in, you said?

94
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:14,349
Is this what killed that courtesan?

95
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:15,403
That's correct.

96
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,379
That's called a steel tip arrow,

97
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:21,143
and I was told they're made to order.

98
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,589
You will be able to catch the culprit

99
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,629
by getting a list of suspects
who bought the steel tip arrows

100
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,183
from the bow and arrow maker.

101
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:32,269
This is the arrow you used

102
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,793
when you killed the wild boar, is it not?

103
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:38,363
If my intention was to kill her,
why would I have gone to the doctor?

104
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:42,903
She was alive then.
The doctor will confirm it.

105
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,933
Is he telling the truth?

106
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,303
Yes, he is.

107
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:00,153
I understand.

108
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,452
Return home for now.

109
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:05,668
Once the investigation begins,

110
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,623
I will summon you back.

111
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,369
You must find suspects first...

112
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:13,263
I understand. You may leave.

113
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:38,253
Thank you for your help.

114
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:40,853
What is a doctor's job?

115
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:44,493
I am only disappointed
that I could not save the woman's life.

116
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,163
How did it go?

117
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:50,433
All I tried to do was to save a life,
but I almost got framed for murder.

118
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,343
What are you going to do with the baby?

119
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,119
What else could we do?

120
00:08:58,143 --> 00:09:00,613
We should look after him
for at least a while.

121
00:09:05,453 --> 00:09:06,613
Give him to me.

122
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,993
Good boy, good boy.

123
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:16,799
He is hungry.

124
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,423
He needs to be fed.

125
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:29,673
What are you looking at?

126
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,319
Find someone to nurse him.

127
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:34,849
I have an urgent business to take care of.

128
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:35,883
But...

129
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,959
I must pay a visit
to the bow and arrow maker.

130
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:40,983
Here.

131
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:45,083
I am going to the courtesan house.

132
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:47,129
I will feed the baby,

133
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,269
and find out more about Sawol.

134
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,009
Someone may know the identity
of the boy's father.

135
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,639
There must be a reason why
she had to die.

136
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:56,209
I agree with you.

137
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,433
Stay safe.

138
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:01,673
Dain!

139
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:04,243
Yes?

140
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:08,113
We're finally working as a team.

141
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:15,283
Haven't you noticed
I've been making all the efforts for that?

142
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,153
How sweet her words are.

143
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:29,679
Did you get it?

144
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes.

145
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,603
These were the officials who belonged
to the Office of Military Staff Guards.

146
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:43,213
Do you know who was in charge
of escorting Prince Hwiyeong?

147
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,983
Well... I am not sure of that.

148
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:51,223
Kim Myeongse?

149
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:56,099
Is this the governor of Jeolla Province
Kim Myeongse?

150
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,539
Yes, that is he.

151
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:00,409
He is the envy of every young official.

152
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:03,909
He started to climb up the ladder
about ten years ago

153
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:07,973
and got rich by serving as an auditor
for two consecutive terms.

154
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,243
I apologize.

155
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,473
But why do you ask?

156
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,183
Good job.

157
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:23,783
Of course.

158
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:42,573
Is there something you want to tell me?

159
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:48,173
You are the one who must talk.

160
00:11:58,223 --> 00:12:01,193
I heard you gave something
to the chief secretary.

161
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,023
Well...

162
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,469
Tell His Lordship this instant!

163
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:09,939
The Chief Royal Secretary was looking
for a former seonjeonkwan.

164
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,803
So I only gave him a list of names.

165
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,243
You did not only give it to him.

166
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:23,543
A military staff guard...

167
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,059
What was the reason?

168
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,259
I do not know the reason.

169
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:32,099
You handed over a list of officials
without knowing why?

170
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:36,369
And you... Received money for it?

171
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:37,463
Well, I...

172
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,763
I have committed a grave sin!

173
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:45,473
It is only grave if you stay silent.

174
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,703
Tell me.

175
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:52,143
What else did you talk about?

176
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:57,913
He asked which man on the list
escorted P-Prince Hwiyeong,

177
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:01,029
and I told him I did not know.

178
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,523
That is all!

179
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,183
Prince Hwiyeong?

180
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,763
Please wait here for a moment.

181
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:16,563
Sure.

182
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,283
You've gone mad!

183
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:38,523
On top of impersonating a royal agent,
you're meeting the Sheriff?

184
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,423
Chunsam, if Lord Igyeom finds out...

185
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:50,839
Welcome.

186
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,079
It is an honor to have you as my guest.

187
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:57,843
I am Kang Inchung,
the sheriff of this town.

188
00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:59,373
Good.

189
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:02,559
You asked to see me?

190
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,853
Being a royal agent is difficult,
and it does not pay well.

191
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:11,199
Now that you are in my town,
you must give me a chance to treat you.

192
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:12,223
Treat me?

193
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,103
This is not much, but please accept it.

194
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,103
What is this?

195
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:09,059
Isn't this gold?

196
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,753
Please put in a good word for me
with His Majesty.

197
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:15,653
Forget it.

198
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,223
Gold to me is like stone!

199
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,869
That is even better.

200
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:22,670
What?

201
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:27,193
Pretend those are pieces of stone
and take them, won't you?

202
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,633
I am not mad, so how could I?

203
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,833
These are pieces of stone, stone.

204
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,453
These are pieces of stone.
These are pieces of stone.

205
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:49,853
It's gold.

206
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,743
Are you here to order a bow?

207
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,353
What are you doing? Why?

208
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:43,073
Are you in?

209
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:50,482
My good man!

210
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:52,053
Wake up!

211
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,093
Thank you.

212
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,803
Oh, how precious.

213
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,379
Where did you find this infant?

214
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:16,979
- What a sweet creature.
- He is adorable.

215
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,649
May I hold him?

216
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:22,913
Obviously someone abandoned him
because they didn't want to raise him.

217
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,083
Like you?

218
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,929
Be quiet, girls. He might hear you.

219
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:29,153
He's Sawol's baby.

220
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,293
Where is Sawol?

221
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,723
I-Is she dead?

222
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,563
She was a good girl.

223
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,873
This is all his doing.

224
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:50,303
This is all whose doing?

225
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,989
Are you serious?

226
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:58,613
Fine!

227
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:03,053
We call that man the Little Sheriff.

228
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,693
The Little Sheriff? Kang Jonggil?

229
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,933
How could a pregnant courtesan
stay at the courtesan house?

230
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:16,609
He made sure Sawol could stay here.

231
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:19,009
His father would have been furious
had he found out,

232
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,533
so he hid her here.

233
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:23,819
Look after the baby.

234
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:25,313
If he cries, feed him.

235
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:45,163
Are you in?

236
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:48,493
Are you in there?

237
00:18:54,673 --> 00:18:57,903
Sir, what brings you back here?

238
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,083
Take it.

239
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:04,613
Pardon me?

240
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:07,053
Take it.

241
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,853
What is this?

242
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:12,793
Open it.

243
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,449
This is gold.

244
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:27,909
You are correct.

245
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,073
This is too much.

246
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:31,943
No, thank you.

247
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:38,653
With this, you won't go hungry again.

248
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,123
Take it for the sake of your boys.

249
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:55,633
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,683
Get back to what you were doing.

251
00:19:58,303 --> 00:19:59,303
Goodbye.

252
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:06,949
Lord Seong, I am glad you are here.
I have something to tell...

253
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,253
The bow and arrow maker is dead.

254
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,290
What?

255
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:12,253
The man who killed Sawol is destroying
any and all evidence.

256
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,923
Do you have an idea whom it might be?

257
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:18,599
He is an expert archer.

258
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:20,999
How many man could there be in this town

259
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:24,693
who uses a custom-made bow
and can hit a target in the dark?

260
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,339
Kang Jonggil?

261
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:28,363
Yes.

262
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:30,839
But something is odd.

263
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,809
How could he kill a woman
carrying his child?

264
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,833
What?

265
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:38,073
Sawol was pregnant
with Kang Jonggil's child.

266
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,443
Let us talk inside.

267
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,323
So why did he kill Sawol?

268
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,709
Sawol knew something
about the previous royal secret agent.

269
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,663
When she tried to tell us, he killed her.

270
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,373
Our only witness is dead.

271
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:08,609
What horrible thing could he have done

272
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:11,803
to kill the woman
who was carrying his child to hide it?

273
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:14,973
The royal secret agent?

274
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:17,959
Kang Jonggil becomes disgusting
when he gets drunk,

275
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,883
so Sawol always dealt with him.

276
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,529
She could have heard something
about the royal secret agent.

277
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,923
He says all sorts of things
when he gets drunk.

278
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:29,199
When he's inebriated,
he will even criticize his own father,

279
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:33,169
so if you nudged him a bit,
he might tell you something.

280
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,839
You mean ask him directly?

281
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:35,863
Yes.

282
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,179
Let me try it.

283
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:41,249
No.

284
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:42,549
No?

285
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:45,413
The risk is too high because
we do not know how he might react.

286
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,519
But this is the quickest way.

287
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:51,019
Alcohol is best for finding out
how one feels inside.

288
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,783
Do you think he will tell you?

289
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,659
I am Honglang.

290
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:59,323
Winning over a man's heart
is like taking candy from a baby.

291
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:01,923
Do you think all men are that simple?

292
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,393
Some men are like me.

293
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,973
W-What are you doing?

294
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,103
What are you trying to do?

295
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:21,419
With you, it's not that I have failed.

296
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:22,743
I chose not to.

297
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,783
Do you think I would fall for you?

298
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:32,323
The Little Sheriff is here.

299
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:36,223
Do not get yourself in trouble.

300
00:22:52,513 --> 00:22:54,643
We meet again, sir.

301
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:09,423
Sir, let me pour you a drink.

302
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,173
This tastes especially sweet tonight.

303
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:33,160
Sir.

304
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:35,083
She's having fun, isn't she?

305
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,453
Please stop.

306
00:23:39,723 --> 00:23:41,553
Stay still.

307
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:02,213
Sawol is dead, I hear.

308
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:06,213
Yes.

309
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:08,513
Do you know who killed her?

310
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,853
How would I know?

311
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:17,563
Yes, she got herself killed.

312
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:21,193
What do you mean?

313
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,203
How dare she be in league
with a royal agent?

314
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:33,073
Sawol was in league with a royal agent?

315
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:38,583
Where were you last night?

316
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:43,259
I was here.

317
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,423
Liar.

318
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:48,153
Tell me what you saw.

319
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:54,633
Sir, I do not understand what you're...

320
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:59,633
You've been in league
with a royal agent as well!

321
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:09,389
You filthy bastard.

322
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:11,543
Tell me, why did you kill Sawol?

323
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:14,313
You are meddling.

324
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,253
Do you wish to end up like him?

325
00:25:18,223 --> 00:25:21,253
Did you kill the royal secret agent?

326
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:26,793
Tell me. I asked you if you killed him.

327
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:30,603
Do you think I killed him?

328
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:35,273
Then try to prove it.

329
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,473
You!

330
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:46,683
Lord Seong.

331
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:48,853
Come.

332
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,759
Sir.

333
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,783
Get them!

334
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:57,163
That way! Get them!

335
00:25:58,393 --> 00:25:59,993
Get them, get them!

336
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:13,473
This way.

337
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,093
Take him to a safe place.

338
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,470
Thank you.

339
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:30,623
Go.

340
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:36,733
Go to the tavern and see Chunsam.

341
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:37,910
What about you?

342
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,009
You go ahead.

343
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,509
I refuse to go alone.

344
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,003
I will catch up with you soon.

345
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:46,189
I will hold you to that.

346
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,213
Of course.

347
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:08,633
So, who's first?

348
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,473
What are you waiting for? Get him!

349
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:24,143
Hey, this is cheating.

350
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:46,503
Lady Dain, what happened?

351
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,493
Where is Lord Seong?
Why do you have a baby?

352
00:27:49,343 --> 00:27:50,443
Take him.

353
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:53,113
Whose baby is this?

354
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:56,519
It's a long story.

355
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:57,913
Let me catch my breath.

356
00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:00,383
Where is Lord Seong?

357
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:03,699
He is fighting with Kang Jonggil's men.

358
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,723
What?

359
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,323
But what if something happens to him?

360
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:11,769
Don't worry about him.

361
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:13,969
You don't know him well enough,

362
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:17,263
but growing up,
he was the best fighter in his town.

363
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:24,143
Instead of studying, he practiced
martial arts with his younger brother.

364
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,123
I'm sure many of them are hurt by now.

365
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:04,113
If you kill me,

366
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:07,059
you won't make it out of here alive.

367
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,083
Kill you?

368
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:10,553
Do you think I would make it that easy?

369
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:16,523
I will make sure you live in pain
for the rest of your life.

370
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:20,063
You won't get away with this!

371
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:25,533
I will remember this!

372
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:34,913
How did he place first on the state exam
if all he did was fight?

373
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:41,059
Lady Dain, once a man
finds love in his heart,

374
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,753
he can do anything.

375
00:29:46,623 --> 00:29:48,669
He fell in love?

376
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:49,693
Yes.

377
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:54,293
But that was how the tragedy began.

378
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,703
Tragedy? What do you mean?

379
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,573
Nothing happened.

380
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:03,203
Tell me.

381
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,589
So Lord Seong is...

382
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:10,659
You're back.

383
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,589
Sir, how are you feeling?

384
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:15,113
Are you hurt?

385
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:16,660
Don't worry.

386
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:19,124
If there is one thing I hate,
it is getting beaten by someone.

387
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:20,793
Let us go inside.

388
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:35,033
I haven't done this in a while,
so I ache everywhere.

389
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:39,543
Where does it hurt?

390
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,349
Let me see.

391
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,373
Ouch.

392
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,029
Why did you get involved?

393
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,129
I have my own ways
of taking care of things.

394
00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:50,429
I regret not beating them even more.

395
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:53,669
How could you say that
when you are hurt?

396
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:56,253
If I am in this state,
imagine the kind of state they must be in.

397
00:30:58,363 --> 00:30:59,593
Are you inside?

398
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,033
Who could that be?

399
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,703
Maybe it's someone Kang Jonggil sent.

400
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:09,503
I will go and check.

401
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:12,473
Who's there?

402
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:21,913
Oh! Madam, what are you doing here?

403
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:23,623
Madam?

404
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:27,029
I thought about it,

405
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,899
and I must return this to you.

406
00:31:28,923 --> 00:31:29,923
Don't.

407
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,739
I am with him.

408
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:34,433
What did you come here to return?

409
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,333
Sir.

410
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:50,543
Your kindness is enough for me.

411
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:55,923
Please take good care of him.

412
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:17,819
I was going to tell you, but...

413
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:19,419
What is this?

414
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:21,873
Please calm down.

415
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:31,053
Actually, I got them from Kang Inchung.

416
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:33,053
What?

417
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:35,393
Please let him explain.

418
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:37,893
Tell us the truth.

419
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:41,333
What happened while we were gone?

420
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:45,233
I deserve to die, sir.

421
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:49,143
I impersonated a royal agent.

422
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:54,189
And I accepted the bribe
the Sheriff offered.

423
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,513
I am sorry.

424
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:59,429
What? A bribe?

425
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:01,359
It wasn't for me.

426
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:04,699
A widow and her children were starving,

427
00:33:04,723 --> 00:33:05,843
so I had no choice but to...

428
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,039
Sir, please calm down.

429
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:10,623
How dare you accept a bribe?

430
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:20,173
Sir.

431
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:05,797
How are you feeling?

432
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,167
I'm sorry, Lady Dain.

433
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:10,937
I deserved it.

434
00:34:16,377 --> 00:34:17,314
Let me see your face.

435
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:19,053
No, I am fine.

436
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:20,176
Let me see.

437
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:25,047
That looks painful.

438
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:32,463
You are the only one who cares for me.

439
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,487
Tell me the rest of the story.

440
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:37,402
What story?

441
00:34:37,426 --> 00:34:39,003
That tragedy.

442
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,366
What happened
after Lord Seong fell in love?

443
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,537
He was happy.

444
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:52,877
But it was brief.

445
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:56,317
Lord Seong had to leave
to take the state exam,

446
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:59,447
and the two of them had to part.

447
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:06,527
But I heard Lord Seong
won the highest honor.

448
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:07,997
He did.

449
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:11,867
But when he returned,
everything was different.

450
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:15,027
Sir!

451
00:35:16,337 --> 00:35:17,737
Wait, sir!

452
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:21,453
Lady Sunae was imprisoned,

453
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:24,723
but Lord Seong's younger brother
who was working at the government office

454
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,647
took her and fled with her.

455
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:30,147
Shoot them!

456
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:35,617
Sunae!

457
00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:57,937
Sunae!

458
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:01,153
Sunae!

459
00:36:01,177 --> 00:36:02,177
Get them!

460
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:15,897
Get them!

461
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:17,597
Sir!

462
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,127
Sir!

463
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:27,207
Don't shoot.

464
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:29,107
What are you doing?

465
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:33,177
Get him out of my way.

466
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:38,017
Wait!

467
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:49,557
Why was Lord Seong's beloved imprisoned?

468
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:55,743
According to rumors,
Lady Sunae began seducing men in town.

469
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,797
After Lord Seong left.

470
00:36:58,937 --> 00:37:00,667
And she was imprisoned because of that.

471
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:06,777
One of those men was
Lord Seong's younger brother.

472
00:37:07,377 --> 00:37:12,393
So Lord Seong's beloved
and his younger brother were intimate?

473
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,993
I haven't seen them since then,

474
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:16,517
so there is no way to confirm that.

475
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:20,487
Now there are just rumors.

476
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:23,727
How could that be?

477
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:27,897
After that day,
he became a completely different man.

478
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:35,737
Lady Dain!

479
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:37,407
Where are you going?

480
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,207
I'm alone again.

481
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,667
Why did I bring that fool with me?

482
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:02,913
How dare he impersonate a royal agent

483
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:04,683
and accept a bribe?

484
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:06,967
Gosh! I am furious.

485
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:17,187
Why are you looking at me like that?

486
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:20,187
It's nothing.

487
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,597
You are a good man.

488
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:35,837
Are you drunk?

489
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:43,137
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've gotten killed.

490
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:45,507
Thank you.

491
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:51,917
Oh, that.

492
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:54,887
It is too soon to thank me.

493
00:38:55,387 --> 00:38:56,857
We still have much work to do.

494
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:10,797
Sir!

495
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,407
I deserve to die.

496
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:27,347
Stand up.

497
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,417
Pardon me?

498
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:41,327
Sir.

499
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:48,907
Sir.

500
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:53,047
You are...

501
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,117
Fired from the royal agent's entourage.

502
00:39:57,377 --> 00:39:58,377
Pardon me?

503
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,833
And the moment we return to Hanyang,

504
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,717
you will be punished for your crimes.

505
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:06,627
Sir!

506
00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:12,043
Lord Seong, Chunsam made a mistake,

507
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:14,143
but he is regretting it.

508
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:15,243
Please show mercy.

509
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,173
Separating public and private businesses

510
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:19,237
is a virtue every royal agent must have.

511
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:22,383
I came to punish corrupt officials,

512
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:25,177
but my own man has committed a crime,

513
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:28,217
so I must punish him accordingly.

514
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:32,447
Sir.

515
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:43,697
When that imbecile

516
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:49,473
claimed he was a royal secret agent,

517
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:52,337
Kang Inchung bribed him
instead of killing him.

518
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:56,507
So why did he have to kill Park Cheolgyu?

519
00:40:58,507 --> 00:40:59,977
There must be

520
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:02,773
something bigger they're trying to hide,

521
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:04,847
on top the death of a royal agent.

522
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:19,497
Is anyone there?

523
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:26,467
Father.

524
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:33,047
Did you play another hunting game
with the prisoners?

525
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:37,553
He had committed kangsangjoe,

526
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,323
and deserved to be beheaded.

527
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:40,347
What?

528
00:41:40,787 --> 00:41:43,333
How could you do something that insane

529
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:45,157
when we need every manpower we can find?

530
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:50,073
Go to the next town
and bring back laborers.

531
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:51,297
Do you understand?

532
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:53,267
Yes.

533
00:42:05,477 --> 00:42:07,353
He is burning up.

534
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:09,153
He doesn't look very well.

535
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:13,223
Baby, if you are sick,
tell us here it hurts.

536
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:15,563
This must be a very serious illness,

537
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:18,003
or he couldn't be crying so hard.

538
00:42:18,027 --> 00:42:20,727
We better take him to see a doctor.

539
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:31,367
Doctor, please take a look at this baby.

540
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:33,983
Oh, it's you.

541
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:36,613
But I have an urgent patient.

542
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,753
Take a second and look at him.

543
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:40,647
You are the one who saved his life.

544
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:45,717
Let me see him.

545
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,843
Lower his temperature by putting
a piece of cold cloth over his forehead,

546
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,137
and feed him when he wakes up.

547
00:43:06,937 --> 00:43:07,943
Is that all?

548
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:09,613
He was crying as if he was dying.

549
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:12,053
That is how all babies do.

550
00:43:12,077 --> 00:43:15,793
His mother's dying wish
was for us to save him,

551
00:43:15,817 --> 00:43:18,047
so he won't die that easily.

552
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:21,833
That little guy almost gave me
a heart attack.

553
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:25,387
Sawol's dying wish. Her last words.

554
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,797
Please... Bury me in that place.

555
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:36,067
Sir, what's wrong?

556
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,877
There must be a reason why
Sawol asked us to bury her in that place.

557
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:41,753
I need to visit the forest.

558
00:43:41,777 --> 00:43:43,383
Sir.

559
00:43:43,407 --> 00:43:44,513
I will go.

560
00:43:44,537 --> 00:43:45,024
I will go too.

561
00:43:45,048 --> 00:43:47,507
No, Chunsam, you stay here
and look after the baby.

562
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:50,477
But... Lady Dain!

563
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:54,587
What are you doing?
The baby is crying.

564
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:57,187
But... But...

565
00:43:57,617 --> 00:43:59,203
I'm not a nurse.

566
00:43:59,227 --> 00:44:00,227
Oh, it's okay.

567
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:06,467
All finished.

568
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:10,167
How do you feel?

569
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:14,467
I feel much better.

570
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:17,437
Next time, be punctual.

571
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:19,953
I apologize.

572
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:22,777
People brought in a baby all of a sudden.

573
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:27,893
You must know too.

574
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:30,163
The courtesan who was killed
by an arrow,

575
00:44:30,187 --> 00:44:31,927
it was her baby.

576
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:35,603
What do you mean?

577
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:37,327
That girl died.

578
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:39,673
Yes, she died.

579
00:44:39,697 --> 00:44:42,967
But she gave birth just before her death.

580
00:44:43,997 --> 00:44:47,407
I used every medical techniques I have
to save that baby.

581
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,283
Is that true?

582
00:44:51,307 --> 00:44:52,923
That baby is alive?

583
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:53,947
Yes.

584
00:44:54,177 --> 00:44:56,477
He is such a handsome boy.

585
00:44:57,817 --> 00:45:01,117
Where is the man who brought the baby?

586
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:11,127
Bury her here?

587
00:46:15,057 --> 00:46:16,057
Get rid of him.

588
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:18,957
Come.

589
00:46:28,837 --> 00:46:30,137
Move them here.

590
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,747
What are you doing here?

591
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,987
Do you know that royal agent?

592
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:24,667
I asked if you know him!

593
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:28,497
He said he would find my little brother.

594
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:34,037
You were in league with the royal agent.

595
00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:36,377
I am with child!

596
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:46,517
I am with your... Child.

597
00:48:19,217 --> 00:48:21,317
Sir, what's wrong?

598
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,177
Special Advisor Park.

599
00:48:51,077 --> 00:48:52,887
Special Advisor Park!

600
00:49:00,757 --> 00:49:02,027
Special Advisor Park...

601
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:09,937
You dug your own grave.

602
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:14,107
I will bury you here, as you wish.

603
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:21,323
You! Do you not fear the punishment?

604
00:49:21,347 --> 00:49:22,787
How dare you raise your voice to me?

605
00:49:23,747 --> 00:49:26,687
Take them to the government office!

606
00:49:27,017 --> 00:49:28,017
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

607
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:54,423
Dain!

608
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:55,447
Lord Seong!

609
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:15,897
Oh, how can a little guy like this
poo like a horse?

610
00:50:21,377 --> 00:50:22,407
Are you smiling?

611
00:50:23,777 --> 00:50:25,177
I want to cry.

612
00:50:26,407 --> 00:50:28,177
I will wash this clean. Just wait.

613
00:50:34,187 --> 00:50:35,187
What's that?

614
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:47,227
He always gets himself into trouble
whenever I'm not looking.

615
00:51:07,926 --> 00:51:12,563
The man who brought you
to the Office of Special Advisors

616
00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:13,627
was me.

617
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:16,103
I was very impressed

618
00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:18,773
by your confidence even in the presence

619
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:21,027
of me and other officials
when I first met you.

620
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:26,467
You never cease to impress me.

621
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:31,153
The rumors of your self-indulgent
lifestyle, drinking every day,

622
00:51:31,177 --> 00:51:32,677
were true.

623
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:35,877
What happened to the man
who placed first on the state exam?

624
00:51:36,813 --> 00:51:40,023
I was wrong about you.

625
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:42,563
How can you trust people?

626
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:46,127
People are the one thing
you should never trust.

627
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:51,557
Seong Igyeom.

628
00:51:58,237 --> 00:52:00,137
Do you know why a country falls?

629
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,483
It is because people stop believing
in their country

630
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:09,247
once they witness officials like you.

631
00:52:17,057 --> 00:52:18,057
Lord Seong.

632
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,057
Lord Seong.

633
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:24,627
What is it?

634
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:28,237
Don't lose faith until tomorrow.

635
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:31,137
Tomorrow?

636
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:33,337
What is happening tomorrow?

637
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:37,207
Royal Guard Choi is coming.

638
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:40,547
What do you mean? I was never told.

639
00:52:41,717 --> 00:52:45,047
Well, he is not coming here to see you.

640
00:52:45,987 --> 00:52:48,793
Anyway, when he arrives tomorrow,

641
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:51,063
he will become suspicious of my absence

642
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:52,563
and come looking for us.

643
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:55,227
Tell me the whole story.

644
00:52:55,827 --> 00:52:59,127
Why is Royal Guard Choi coming
to see you without my knowledge?

645
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:06,167
Are you keeping something from me?

646
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:08,877
Well...

647
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:14,477
I was ordered to report your activities.

648
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:15,977
What?

649
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:19,323
You were spying on me?

650
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:20,687
I wouldn't call it that.

651
00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:23,893
That means you did not trust me.

652
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:26,527
Chunsam stabbed me in the back
and now you.

653
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:30,157
I cannot trust anyone.

654
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:33,473
I had no choice.

655
00:53:33,497 --> 00:53:35,543
You were a scoundrel before.

656
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:37,297
What? A scoundrel?

657
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:40,707
But things are not that bad now.

658
00:53:41,537 --> 00:53:44,647
So I should be grateful?

659
00:53:48,617 --> 00:53:52,663
When Royal Guard Choi arrives tomorrow...

660
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,533
We will be dead by then.

661
00:53:55,557 --> 00:53:58,457
I got stabbed so hard
that I am fully alert.

662
00:54:01,627 --> 00:54:02,857
I have a clever idea.

663
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:06,544
Is anyone there?

664
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:08,897
Anyone! Help me! Please!

665
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:17,913
What is all the ruckus?

666
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:20,707
Help, please. He is dying.

667
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:28,034
What is wrong with him?

668
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:29,763
It looks like diabetes.

669
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:31,863
He may die without treatment.

670
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:33,833
Please take him to a doctor.

671
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,303
Hurry!

672
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:36,327
Just wait.

673
00:54:36,827 --> 00:54:39,727
Oh, he's dying!

674
00:54:41,637 --> 00:54:45,037
Oh, poor man!

675
00:54:46,107 --> 00:54:50,977
Who knew he would die so far from home?

676
00:54:53,577 --> 00:54:57,453
Oh, how tragic!

677
00:54:57,477 --> 00:54:58,517
I found it.

678
00:55:01,187 --> 00:55:03,557
Why aren't you opening the door?

679
00:55:04,287 --> 00:55:05,633
That's enough.

680
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:06,264
What?

681
00:55:06,288 --> 00:55:08,573
He is going to die in the morning.

682
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,073
So this is better.

683
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:12,897
This is a thousand times better
than getting his head chopped off.

684
00:55:14,737 --> 00:55:15,644
Wait!

685
00:55:15,668 --> 00:55:17,573
How could you be so cold?

686
00:55:17,597 --> 00:55:20,683
Even if he is going to die tomorrow,
he should receive treatment!

687
00:55:20,707 --> 00:55:23,177
Wait! Don't go!

688
00:55:28,647 --> 00:55:29,647
Is he gone?

689
00:55:31,387 --> 00:55:32,387
He's gone.

690
00:55:39,927 --> 00:55:41,933
Was that your clever idea?

691
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:44,403
The guard fell for my acting.

692
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:47,167
Had your performance been better,
it would have worked.

693
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:54,543
I have been making a living being a spy,

694
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,247
so how could you criticize my performance?

695
00:55:57,237 --> 00:56:01,077
I could have done a better job than you
with just one foot.

696
00:56:04,547 --> 00:56:05,464
Is he gone?

697
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,823
What was that?

698
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:08,287
I didn't do it like that!

699
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:14,357
This is how you do it!

700
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:18,004
That's enough.

701
00:56:18,028 --> 00:56:20,927
Oh! If Chunsam were here,
I would be out by now.

702
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:22,713
You call that acting?

703
00:56:22,737 --> 00:56:25,007
Oh, he's dying!

704
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:26,367
Unbelievable.

705
00:56:28,977 --> 00:56:29,977
Are you home?

706
00:56:30,877 --> 00:56:32,107
Are you inside?

707
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:34,477
Sir.

708
00:56:39,387 --> 00:56:40,747
I have a favor to ask.

709
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:43,263
I am desperate.

710
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:45,703
Could you please look after this baby
for just a while?

711
00:56:45,727 --> 00:56:47,803
I know I am asking too much,

712
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:49,357
but I have urgent business.

713
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:51,773
I will.

714
00:56:51,797 --> 00:56:52,997
Let me have him.

715
00:56:56,537 --> 00:56:58,743
What is the baby's name?

716
00:56:58,767 --> 00:56:59,767
Name?

717
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:02,377
He doesn't have a name yet.

718
00:57:03,077 --> 00:57:04,077
I see.

719
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,577
I will take good care of him.

720
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:10,847
Thank you.

721
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:15,833
You're not curious?

722
00:57:15,857 --> 00:57:17,187
Why won't you ask me anything?

723
00:57:18,627 --> 00:57:20,763
I wouldn't dare

724
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:24,027
ask about what you do.

725
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:28,673
If I could be of any help to you,

726
00:57:28,697 --> 00:57:31,737
I will happily oblige.

727
00:57:34,637 --> 00:57:38,507
But I have a favor to ask of you too.

728
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,247
Tell me what it is.

729
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:42,447
You must come back,

730
00:57:43,977 --> 00:57:47,217
and give this baby a name.

731
00:57:48,787 --> 00:57:51,327
I will do that.

732
00:57:51,857 --> 00:57:52,887
Goodbye.

733
00:57:58,667 --> 00:57:59,667
Who are you?

734
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:01,737
Here.

735
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:03,167
Magistrate!

736
00:58:03,537 --> 00:58:04,573
Magistrate!

737
00:58:04,597 --> 00:58:06,807
Oh! My Lord!

738
00:58:08,177 --> 00:58:11,323
I have not heard from you,

739
00:58:11,347 --> 00:58:13,177
so I assumed you went back to Hanyang.

740
00:58:13,777 --> 00:58:17,117
I came because I heard members
of my entourage were imprisoned here.

741
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,663
Where is everyone?

742
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,233
Where are the prisoners?

743
00:58:28,257 --> 00:58:31,103
It was the little sheriff.

744
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:32,367
The little sheriff?

745
00:58:33,827 --> 00:58:36,997
Young Lord ordered them to be taken
to the hunting ground.

746
00:58:37,337 --> 00:58:38,337
What?

747
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:45,507
This place is...

748
00:58:46,707 --> 00:58:47,707
What's the matter?

749
00:58:51,217 --> 00:58:52,217
You've come.

750
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:54,493
Why do you look so surprised?

751
00:58:54,517 --> 00:58:55,817
This isn't your first time here.

752
00:58:56,687 --> 00:58:58,457
Why did you bring us here?

753
00:58:59,887 --> 00:59:01,127
Don't you already know?

754
00:59:01,697 --> 00:59:03,227
So I can go hunting.

755
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,097
What is he talking about?

756
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,537
We are his prey.

757
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:12,367
What?

758
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:21,047
Killing us will not make
your despicable crimes disappear.

759
00:59:22,817 --> 00:59:24,377
You are brazen.

760
00:59:25,987 --> 00:59:30,857
Would you rather die after being tortured?

761
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:35,757
I have a special torture for girls.

762
00:59:40,097 --> 00:59:42,243
Put that hand on her

763
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:45,207
and you will never be able to use it again
as long as you shall live.

764
00:59:47,807 --> 00:59:50,007
You are quite brave
for a man facing death.

765
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:54,847
Which of you will go first?

766
00:59:55,577 --> 00:59:56,917
I will go first.

767
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:02,463
No, Lord Seong.

768
01:00:02,487 --> 01:00:03,963
I will go first.

769
01:00:03,987 --> 01:00:06,627
Sure. It is better to get it over with,

770
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:09,157
so you go first.

771
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,057
What?

772
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:14,897
Dain.

773
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:18,367
Yes?

774
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:20,343
Run in a zigzag pattern.

775
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,977
You'll be able to buy time.

776
01:00:23,877 --> 01:00:26,453
Even so, death would be inevitable.

777
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:28,077
Everyone dies someday.

778
01:00:30,647 --> 01:00:31,987
And that day is today?

779
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:37,433
I said I didn't want to join
the royal agent's entourage,

780
01:00:37,457 --> 01:00:39,327
so why did he send me here?

781
01:00:39,687 --> 01:00:42,097
Dain, do not forget what I said.

782
01:00:46,597 --> 01:00:48,013
What are you waiting for?

783
01:00:48,037 --> 01:00:49,037
Bring her.

784
01:00:56,337 --> 01:00:58,047
Go ahead, run.

785
01:01:02,517 --> 01:01:03,517
Hurry!

786
01:01:14,727 --> 01:01:17,827
Do you really think you can stay alive
running so slowly?

787
01:01:32,347 --> 01:01:33,477
How interesting.

788
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,508
[Royal Secret Agent]

789
01:02:19,593 --> 01:02:20,680
Where is Lord Seong?

790
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,210
I sent him to Hwaeomsan.

791
01:02:22,234 --> 01:02:23,750
You only brought two.

792
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:25,020
Only two?

793
01:02:25,044 --> 01:02:28,150
They are fit and strong,
enough to replace a hundred...

794
01:02:28,174 --> 01:02:30,750
You aren't humans here.
You guys are insects.

795
01:02:30,774 --> 01:02:31,421
Insects?

796
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:32,783
This insect has a question.

797
01:02:33,244 --> 01:02:34,630
There must be a way to escape from here.

798
01:02:34,654 --> 01:02:35,491
What? How?

799
01:02:35,515 --> 01:02:37,060
You must go and rescue the royal agent.

800
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:38,300
I cannot go without an order.

801
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:39,930
If His Majesty tells you to die, will you?

802
01:02:39,954 --> 01:02:41,530
If that is what His Majesty wishes...

803
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:43,400
Chunsam, draw your sword.

804
01:02:43,424 --> 01:02:45,270
Maybe I will bite the hand that feeds me.

805
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:46,564
I'll be that dog today.

806
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:48,588
