1
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:05,713
Bring her.

2
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:07,397
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,393
Go ahead, run.

4
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:20,777
Hurry!

5
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:29,859
Dain, run in a zigzag pattern.

6
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:31,153
You'll be able to buy time.

7
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,693
Do you really think you can stay alive
running so slowly?

8
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:50,273
How interesting.

9
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:04,383
Sir!

10
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:54,373
Are you all right?

11
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:55,849
I thought I was going to die.

12
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:57,573
Would I let you die?

13
00:01:57,843 --> 00:01:58,843
You're unbearable.

14
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:27,673
Stop right there!

15
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:28,849
We should go.

16
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:29,503
Yes.

17
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:31,773
Here comes the royal secret agent!

18
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:43,723
What is going on?

19
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:48,453
Do not worry! I am here!

20
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:52,239
That moron.

21
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:54,193
He is no help at all.

22
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,642
What happened here?

23
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:04,420
Father.

24
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:06,343
I have no choice.

25
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:10,559
Men! Apprehend them!

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,020
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

27
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:13,483
What are you doing?

28
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,683
My horse requisition tablet!
What are you doing?

29
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:21,392
If you resist, the royal agent dies.

30
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:23,963
Bring them.

31
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,743
These two are useful so lock them up.

32
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,373
As for this girl, kill her.

33
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:44,513
Wait!

34
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:49,283
What now?

35
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,753
A child of your blood is alive.

36
00:03:56,823 --> 00:04:00,539
What? What are you saying?

37
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:01,609
My blood?

38
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,663
Sawol gave birth to Kang Jonggil's son
before she died.

39
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,643
Is that true?

40
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:14,043
I asked if that is true!

41
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:18,953
She knows where the boy is,

42
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:22,453
so promise you will spare her life,
and you can have the boy.

43
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,769
If you are lying,

44
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:33,133
I will tear your limbs apart and kill you.

45
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,709
Bring them all!

46
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,863
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:47,373
Was that why you could not kill
the girl named Sawol?

48
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,319
I am ashamed.

49
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:54,583
A tiny seed can grow into a massive tree
to stand in your path of success!

50
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:59,053
I will take that girl
and get rid of the child.

51
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:01,423
- Father!
- Do as I say.

52
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:05,533
Do you really think of him
as your blood?

53
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:07,869
No.

54
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,409
You are pathetic.

55
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:14,203
You take the other two
and bring them to Hwaeomsan.

56
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,472
Yes, Father.

57
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,529
I'm sorry, sir.

58
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:30,313
How dare you impersonate
a royal agent again?

59
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:32,599
I was only trying to save you.

60
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,493
I almost escaped, but...

61
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:36,763
I am here again, thanks to you.

62
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,109
I had no idea
they killed the royal secret agent.

63
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:46,273
Who could've thought they murdered
a royal agent and buried its body?

64
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:50,803
But Lord Seong, are you really
going to hand the baby over to them?

65
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,519
The moment I give them the baby,

66
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:56,313
they will kill him as well as all of us.

67
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,259
The baby will live.

68
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:01,159
Actually, we will all live.

69
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:03,129
What do you mean?

70
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:06,029
Look around.
The prison cells are completely empty.

71
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:07,353
Don't you find that odd?

72
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,399
Prisoners were all sent to the labor camp.

73
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:14,539
They even framed
innocent people to send more.

74
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:18,749
Yes, that widow, she said
her husband was sent to do hard labor.

75
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:21,179
Could that be the same place
where Sawol's younger brother was sent?

76
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:23,579
They said we were useful.

77
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:25,513
They will send us to the labor camp.

78
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:29,019
But sir, what about Lady Dain?

79
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:30,619
What will happen to her?

80
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:33,153
They are looking for the baby,
so they won't kill her for now.

81
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:35,953
Dain, do as I tell you.

82
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:41,853
Lord Seong!

83
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:46,593
Stay alive and return to Hanyang.

84
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:52,003
You must stay alive too, Lord Seong.

85
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,579
If we meet again, I will...

86
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:55,643
Be quiet!

87
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,543
Lord Seong! Lord Seong!

88
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:01,613
You come with me.

89
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:22,379
Governor Kang Inchung imposed
heavy taxes on his people

90
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:24,133
and bribed people of power.

91
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:27,049
Is this true?

92
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:32,973
Your Majesty, you need to know the reason
why Governor Kang did such a thing.

93
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:34,719
The reason?

94
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,913
Does wickedness require a reason?

95
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:40,059
I am immensely saddened to report to you

96
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:47,223
that the man Governor Kang bribed
was the royal agent you sent recently.

97
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:49,693
What?

98
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:52,033
Chief State Councilor Kim!

99
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:55,979
Are you using unconfirmed rumors
to create chaos in the government?

100
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:58,709
There are previous cases

101
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,903
of royal secret agents demanding bribes
as an excuse for inspections.

102
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:05,919
The reason why local government officials'
corruption is becoming more serious

103
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,249
is because the royal secret agents
who inspect them

104
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:10,588
are generating corruption
in the local governments.

105
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:14,659
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor Kim
is leaping to a ridiculous conclusion.

106
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:18,623
So what is it that you want to say?

107
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:23,439
If this royal agent's corruption
is confirmed,

108
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:27,363
replace him with the man we recommend.

109
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,949
Are you saying
the man you recommend is reliable?

110
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:35,103
Chief Royal Secretary Jang!
Are you trying to insult us?

111
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:43,613
Enough!

112
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,723
Summon those involved
in the incident and investigate.

113
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:53,229
Those who offered the bribe
and those who accepted it

114
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,639
will be removed from office,

115
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,969
and everyone who were involved

116
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:00,593
will be demanded to take responsibility.

117
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,843
You look terrible.

118
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,189
Who could have known

119
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,973
that the royal agent accepted bribes?

120
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,283
We are yet to confirm it,
so we will talk about that another time.

121
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:21,983
You should learn to read people better.

122
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:25,923
His Majesty is very concerned.

123
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:28,863
Are you concerned, Lord Kim?

124
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

125
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:35,663
You're using rumors about the royal agent
to cover up the governor's crimes.

126
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:39,303
Is this a false rumor too?

127
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:44,073
I hear you have been making inquiries
about the Prince Hwiyeong incident.

128
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:50,383
What good would come from
being associated with a traitor like him?

129
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,043
You should watch out for yourself.

130
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,353
Come.

131
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:15,903
We are here.

132
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:20,043
Where is the baby?

133
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:21,543
He is in there.

134
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:27,289
Give me a moment,
and I will bring the baby out.

135
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:31,823
No. I need to see him with my own eyes.

136
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:33,753
Lower me down.

137
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,543
Where is the baby?

138
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:01,853
W-Well...

139
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,129
Attack him!

140
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,253
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

141
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,563
Where is Lord Seong?

142
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:52,509
What happened?

143
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,509
It's a long story.

144
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,843
If you wish to live, talk.

145
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:00,613
I asked where Lord Seong is.

146
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:04,359
I sent him to Hwaeomsan.

147
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:05,513
Hwaeomsan?

148
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:07,983
Why?

149
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:10,753
Tell me!

150
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:15,093
I send all prisoners there.

151
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:16,893
What is the reason?

152
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:21,509
They need laborers.

153
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,233
I just send them because they need men.

154
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,603
I have nothing to do with them.

155
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:38,683
There is something I must give you
on behalf of Sawol.

156
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:52,233
Aren't you coming?

157
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:56,903
I am.

158
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,263
It's these two.

159
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:26,033
Just two?

160
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,133
What do you mean?

161
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,479
I told you over and over again
we need more men,

162
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,873
but you only brought two.

163
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,603
Only two?

164
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:39,849
Look at them.

165
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:42,983
They are fit and strong,
enough to replace a hundred...

166
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,993
Do you want him to end up in bed
before he goes to work?

167
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,779
Let them in!

168
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:04,803
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,259
He is a spirited one.

170
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:21,553
Breaking him won't be easy.

171
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:35,763
Move!

172
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:38,203
Move.

173
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,903
Move along! Move!

174
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,753
Sir, are you hurt?

175
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:54,813
What are you doing?

176
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:56,330
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,259
Get up.

178
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,283
Now!

179
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:02,963
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:08,863
Sir, where are we?

181
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:11,633
Everyone looks lifeless,

182
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,203
as if they are about to die.

183
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,513
Everything was the royal agent's idea?

184
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:34,069
Yes, he told me to tell Kang Inchung
that I would give him the baby

185
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,539
and bring them to you instead.

186
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:37,923
He said then I could live.

187
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:42,933
So was he taken away
after he sent you to me?

188
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:45,803
Yes.

189
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:48,673
Hmm...

190
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:51,503
We will return to Hanyang.

191
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,819
We must go to Hwaeomsan.

192
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:55,789
We must save Lord Seong first.

193
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,689
We must report this to His Majesty first.

194
00:15:57,713 --> 00:16:00,389
What if something bad happens
to Lord Seong?

195
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:03,853
He is not as weak as you think.

196
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:07,823
It will become dark soon
so let us find lodging.

197
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,943
Listen to what I say carefully.

198
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,389
No one here cares about what you did

199
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:31,013
in the outside world.

200
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:35,529
In here, you are not humans

201
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:38,769
but bulls, pigs,

202
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:42,123
chickens, and insects.

203
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:43,499
Insects?

204
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:44,523
Understand?

205
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:48,138
Just remember three things.

206
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:51,439
First, do as you are told.

207
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:52,409
Two...

208
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,203
This insect has a question.

209
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:57,549
Where are we?

210
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,373
Why did you bring us here?

211
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:07,813
What should we do?

212
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,153
Chunsam.

213
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,953
Second, talk too much
and you will be beaten.

214
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:23,763
Third, try to escape and you will die.

215
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:28,273
You are here to pay for the crimes
you have committed.

216
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:32,749
Keep your mouth shut
and do what we tell you to do.

217
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:34,049
Understand?

218
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:35,073
Yes!

219
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:38,413
It's gold! It's gold!

220
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:40,313
Everyone, stop working!

221
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,703
I heard about this
when I was working in the palace.

222
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:02,173
The rich local noblemen mine gold
and keep it for themselves

223
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:05,313
without reporting it to the government.

224
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:07,943
It is called jamchae.

225
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:10,743
Jamchae?

226
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:17,053
The bribe you received from the sheriff
must be from here.

227
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,523
This was all about gold.

228
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:26,233
Special Advisor Park was murdered,
trying to report this.

229
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:28,603
This place...

230
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:34,573
Is hell that was created by the greed
of corrupt men.

231
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:44,519
Are you writing a letter
to Chief Royal Secretary?

232
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:45,613
Yes.

233
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:48,583
Tell me what the Royal Agent
has been doing.

234
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:59,409
At first, I thought the royal agent

235
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:03,163
was a very unusual and peculiar man.

236
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:04,963
Happy?

237
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:10,743
But as time passed by,
he grew even stranger.

238
00:19:11,403 --> 00:19:12,190
Stupid.

239
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:14,413
He treats his servant like a friend

240
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:19,253
and tries to help the weak despite danger.

241
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,259
Why did I bring that imbecile?

242
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:22,499
He admits faults.

243
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:24,159
Separating public and private businesses

244
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:25,899
is a virtue every royal agent
must possess.

245
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,603
A man who takes responsibility
for himself.

246
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:31,263
I have never met a nobleman like him.

247
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,803
You must like him very much.

248
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:15,303
Come. Hurry!

249
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:20,543
Hurry!

250
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:34,769
Sir, what do we do now?

251
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:37,823
Now that I know everything, I must leave.

252
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:39,563
How?

253
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,209
There must be a way to escape from here.

254
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,863
Don't try anything stupid.

255
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:48,049
When one tries to escape,
everyone starves for three days.

256
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:51,719
There were those who tried to escape,

257
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:54,373
but they all failed.

258
00:20:57,283 --> 00:21:01,253
They all returned as paraplegics
and eventually died.

259
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:04,829
It is impossible
to escape from here by yourself.

260
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:07,293
You are correct.
No one can escape by himself.

261
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:10,123
That is why I need everyone's help.

262
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:13,839
Give up making plans to escape,

263
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,003
and get some sleep.

264
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,903
Do you want to work here
until the day you die?

265
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,649
I will go.

266
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:28,213
I will escape from here
and return with men.

267
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,483
Oh, as if you are some royal secret agent.

268
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:35,713
Hey!

269
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,083
Do you know who this man is?

270
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:40,469
Who is he?

271
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:41,793
He's...

272
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:43,993
He's a...

273
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,903
A very good man.

274
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:56,203
As if he's Buddha.

275
00:21:56,843 --> 00:21:58,203
That's enough.

276
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:10,123
Sir! Something terrible happened.

277
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,483
What is it?

278
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,063
Father, are you all right?

279
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:26,349
An assassin was waiting for me

280
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:28,373
at the place that girl took me.

281
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:29,943
An assassin?

282
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:32,689
Where did they go?

283
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:35,689
They must have gone to Hwaeomsan.

284
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:40,883
Go and bring all the newborns in town.

285
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:42,929
Newborns?

286
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:45,023
Yes! Your son!

287
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:55,009
Do not rest until you arrive.

288
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,033
Yes, sir.

289
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:26,233
Give me some more.

290
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:39,073
Oh, look at this.

291
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:42,459
This is barely enough
to keep me breathing.

292
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:43,983
They call this a meal?

293
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:47,753
At least it's good. Try it.

294
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,223
Where are you going?

295
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:00,139
We are out of time.

296
00:24:00,163 --> 00:24:02,533
You must go and rescue Lord Seong
before it's too late.

297
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,309
I sent words
so the order will arrive soon.

298
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,779
That will take too long.

299
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:08,079
We are out of time.

300
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:09,903
I cannot go without an order.

301
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:14,673
Then you stay here.
I will go alone.

302
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:19,613
How can a woman like you
go there by yourself?

303
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:21,929
Then come with me.

304
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,583
I must wait for His Majesty's order.

305
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:26,793
Of course.

306
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:34,463
If His Majesty orders you to die,
will you?

307
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,463
If that is what His Majesty wishes...

308
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:40,749
Oh, forget it!

309
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:41,809
Just go.

310
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,003
I am going there by myself.

311
00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:51,213
The royal agent must have had a hard time.

312
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:00,353
Move!

313
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:05,923
Hurry up!

314
00:25:14,203 --> 00:25:15,273
Are you all right?

315
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:17,449
Go and take a break.

316
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,713
Who gave you permission?

317
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:25,389
It's you again.

318
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,959
He could die.

319
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,683
I am the master here.

320
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,183
Get up.

321
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:33,523
Careful.

322
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:39,233
If I can't use you, there is no reason
for you to stay alive.

323
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:51,919
If you are the master, act like one.

324
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:54,143
How much longer
will you harass the workers?

325
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:00,883
I should cut off your tongue first.

326
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:04,953
Watch and see what happens

327
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,593
when you bite the hand that feeds you!

328
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:11,293
Someone told me that I'm like a scoundrel.

329
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,673
Maybe I will bite the hand that feeds me.

330
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:18,303
I'll be that dog today.

331
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,173
You.

332
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:23,379
No!

333
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:25,649
Sir, sir.

334
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:27,919
Won't you please forgive him?

335
00:26:27,943 --> 00:26:28,820
What?

336
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:30,519
He may appear perfectly normal,

337
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:31,989
but he deserves your pity.

338
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:34,559
He fell from a jujube tree
when he was young and hurt his head,

339
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,399
so he doesn't know what he's saying.

340
00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:38,693
As his master,
please show him mercy and...

341
00:26:56,843 --> 00:26:57,843
Stop!

342
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:14,153
You're back, M'lord.

343
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:23,463
What is going on?

344
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,909
It's nothing.

345
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,949
A few workers caused a disturbance,

346
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:29,243
and I was sorting it out.

347
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:47,929
Your eyes are still alive,

348
00:27:47,953 --> 00:27:50,123
so you must be a recent addition.

349
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,293
Why did you cause a disturbance?

350
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,963
The workload for the weak is too severe.

351
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:01,973
If you committed a crime,
you must pay for it.

352
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:06,073
Some have been brought here wrongly.

353
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:09,613
Is that so?

354
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:13,553
Fine.

355
00:28:16,783 --> 00:28:19,299
If there is anyone here
who was brought wrongly,

356
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,753
come out right now.

357
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,693
I will send you home.

358
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:26,363
I was...

359
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,253
Did you see that?

360
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:48,583
There is none.

361
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:55,799
Thanks to your ill-advised bravery,

362
00:28:55,823 --> 00:28:58,363
everyone will starve.

363
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:04,509
If you cause another disturbance,

364
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:08,573
you will lose your head.

365
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:18,713
What are you waiting for?
Get to work!

366
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:25,599
Sir, could you please
try not to stand out?

367
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:28,069
What good could come
from standing up to them?

368
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,939
I am a royal agent,

369
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:31,599
so how could I watch people suffer?

370
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:34,639
I am someone who is suffering too!

371
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:36,933
That was close.

372
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:40,749
Why didn't anyone come out?

373
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:45,519
If anyone did,
they would've lost their lives.

374
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:48,743
You will soon learn.

375
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:51,159
Who is that man?

376
00:29:51,183 --> 00:29:55,329
I don't know.
Some say he is the owner of this place,

377
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:59,893
and some say he was sent here
by someone high up.

378
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,469
No one knows for sure.

379
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:08,533
But he is someone of power.

380
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
M'lord.

381
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,230
How ridiculous must they think of you
to act out like that?

382
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:49,776
I am sorry.

383
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:56,013
Bring me the goods.

384
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:58,477
Yes, M'lord.

385
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:08,057
The quantity is especially small.

386
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:14,227
There was an epidemic,
killing a lot of men.

387
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,827
If you are short of men,
increase the workload!

388
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:19,727
Pardon me?

389
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,613
Yes, I will do that.

390
00:31:23,637 --> 00:31:26,043
I will take this today,

391
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,777
but next time,
make sure you twice the amount ready.

392
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:31,247
Yes, M'lord.

393
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:46,387
May I ask you something?

394
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:50,033
Is this the road to Hwaeomsan?

395
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:51,273
Yes, it is.

396
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:54,613
I heard there are many men working there.

397
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:56,537
Do you know what they are doing?

398
00:31:57,067 --> 00:31:58,067
I don't.

399
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,907
Why do you want to go there?

400
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:10,493
Someone I know has been taken there.

401
00:32:10,517 --> 00:32:12,723
You better not go there.

402
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,663
I have seen many men go in,

403
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:16,587
but I am yet to see anyone come out.

404
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:29,997
Hurry up!

405
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:37,007
Oh? We are missing one.

406
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,107
Someone is missing.

407
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:40,907
What?

408
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:46,363
Search everywhere!

409
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:47,387
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:51,933
The old man Kim is missing.

411
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:54,197
Could he have?

412
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:20,817
Listen carefully.

413
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:26,203
If one of you escapes,

414
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:28,397
one from the rest will be killed,

415
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:32,597
and if two of you escape,
two will be killed.

416
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:41,477
Please spare me!

417
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:47,177
Watch carefully.

418
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:52,617
No, no.

419
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:58,957
M'lord!

420
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:00,927
M'lord!

421
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:10,096
What? He died?

422
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:19,777
Over here.

423
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,056
Toss him outside.

424
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,326
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:47,937
Let's go.

426
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:51,647
Out of my way!

427
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:52,847
Out of my way!

428
00:34:58,247 --> 00:34:59,247
Step aside!

429
00:34:59,817 --> 00:35:01,517
I didn't expect this...

430
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,397
I would like to ask you one question.

431
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:09,597
What is it?

432
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:13,897
Do you still want to escape from here?

433
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:17,497
What if I do?

434
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:21,237
I have an older sister.

435
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:25,477
She was pregnant,
and she must have given birth by now.

436
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:29,123
She said she would name the baby
Yunsu if it's a boy

437
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:31,587
and Yunhui if it's a girl.

438
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:36,487
I want to meet the baby in person.

439
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,067
Is you older sister Sawol?

440
00:35:48,997 --> 00:35:51,367
Yes. Do you know my sister?

441
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:56,377
Sawol passed away.

442
00:35:58,677 --> 00:35:59,677
What?

443
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:05,887
What do you mean?

444
00:36:07,657 --> 00:36:11,657
She was killed by the sheriff's son.

445
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:29,537
Sawol gave birth before she died.

446
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:34,247
Did the baby survive?

447
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:36,717
Where is it?

448
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:39,423
I left the baby with someone I can trust,

449
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,887
so you don't need to worry.

450
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:47,187
You must leave this place alive
for the sake of that baby.

451
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:11,377
Sir.

452
00:38:15,017 --> 00:38:16,017
Sir.

453
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:20,917
He is dead.

454
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:53,547
What is that place?

455
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:57,857
It is heavily guarded,
so they must be hiding something.

456
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:02,233
What could they be hiding
so deep in the mountain?

457
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,667
Whatever it is, it must be something
dangerous enough to cost people's lives.

458
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,843
We must figure out a way
to get in there.

459
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:12,343
There is a proper process for everything.

460
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:13,743
His Majesty must hear...

461
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:14,767
Dain,

462
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:18,107
how do you plan on getting inside
without any decent plan?

463
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:22,047
I am going to take a look around first.

464
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:57,217
They change shifts
at six a.m. and six p.m.

465
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:01,187
Those are the only times
we can hide from them.

466
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:04,863
But the term is too short

467
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:07,857
for you to be able to reach the gate.

468
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:14,313
Has anyone tried to escape before?

469
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:16,243
There were a few.

470
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:18,583
So? What happened?

471
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:19,607
Well...

472
00:40:54,837 --> 00:40:57,007
Don't come! Don't come!

473
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:02,557
Ouch! That's hurts.

474
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,557
Sir, we wouldn't make it
because of the guards.

475
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:08,933
What are you up to?

476
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:09,957
Oh, my heart.

477
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:12,733
I am finished.

478
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:13,663
I'm all done.

479
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:14,573
Hurry up and move.

480
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,597
Yes, sir.

481
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:20,967
Hurry up and get up!

482
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:24,067
If you have finished eating, get up.

483
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:29,637
I will use them.

484
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:46,327
What is that?

485
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:49,257
It is a numbing drug.

486
00:41:58,567 --> 00:41:59,567
Lord Choi,

487
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,577
you must speak like a slave.

488
00:42:04,577 --> 00:42:05,983
Like a slave?

489
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:07,007
Yes.

490
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:09,423
"What is that?"

491
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:11,487
Have you ever heard of a slave
speak like that?

492
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:17,317
Must we do this?

493
00:42:18,027 --> 00:42:19,027
Lord Choi,

494
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:22,527
this look suits you much better.

495
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:38,883
Why are you taking my baby?

496
00:42:38,907 --> 00:42:40,423
It is just an infant!

497
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:41,447
Out of my way!

498
00:42:42,377 --> 00:42:43,194
Sir, no!

499
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:46,117
My baby! My baby!

500
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,327
We are going to Hwaeomsan.

501
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:32,097
Stop! Stop!

502
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:36,097
What is this?

503
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,707
This must be the place.

504
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:39,844
Who are you?

505
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,253
Reveal who you are.

506
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:43,983
Reveal who I am?

507
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:46,083
Can't you tell?

508
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:48,217
I am from the tavern in town.

509
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,163
I heard you need supplies here,

510
00:43:52,187 --> 00:43:53,847
so I came to do business.

511
00:43:54,317 --> 00:43:55,587
Supplies?

512
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,387
Dolsoe, show them.

513
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:03,127
Dolsoe.

514
00:44:06,597 --> 00:44:07,737
Yes, ma'am.

515
00:44:17,177 --> 00:44:19,507
Oh, I didn't just bring these
for you to only look at.

516
00:44:21,217 --> 00:44:21,924
Here.

517
00:44:21,948 --> 00:44:23,147
But...

518
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,933
We shouldn't drink on the job.

519
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,063
Oh, don't be silly.

520
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:31,987
Just try it.

521
00:44:32,557 --> 00:44:35,727
It will give you energy,
so it's basically medicine.

522
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:39,273
And you are not monks,

523
00:44:39,297 --> 00:44:42,037
so why live like one
in such a beautiful place?

524
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:48,607
Nice.

525
00:44:58,217 --> 00:44:59,217
Come with me.

526
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:34,687
You may go inside.

527
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:35,917
What?

528
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:37,787
You will be paid.

529
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:40,157
Oh, thank you.

530
00:45:47,197 --> 00:45:48,637
No slave is allowed inside.

531
00:46:06,447 --> 00:46:09,317
Oh, how handsome you all are!

532
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:10,594
I should have come sooner.

533
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:12,687
Have you no fear?

534
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,127
Why did you come here?

535
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:22,543
I heard this place is full of men,

536
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:24,383
but since you are deep in the mountain,

537
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,237
you are always in need of wine and meat.

538
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,067
That is correct.

539
00:46:31,107 --> 00:46:34,547
But haven't you heard this?

540
00:46:35,717 --> 00:46:37,147
Like what?

541
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:53,497
People my come in,

542
00:46:56,197 --> 00:46:58,167
but they never leave.

543
00:47:12,217 --> 00:47:13,217
Dain!

544
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:22,857
For a slave, you sure are brave.

545
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:30,673
If you don't want to see this girl die,

546
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:32,337
you better not put up a fight.

547
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:34,937
Drop the sword!

548
00:47:43,247 --> 00:47:44,247
Oh, please.

549
00:47:46,787 --> 00:47:48,387
Try harder.

550
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:52,703
Dain.

551
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:53,564
Yes?

552
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:55,633
Was this a part of your plan?

553
00:47:55,657 --> 00:47:58,467
The thing about plans

554
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:00,597
is that they often go south.

555
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,956
Why did you drop your sword?

556
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,720
The letter must have reached
Hanyang by now.

557
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,920
Your Majesty...

558
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,590
Chief Royal Secretary Jang,

559
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,560
where are you going in such a hurry?

560
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,076
I was on my way to see His Majesty.

561
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,346
I heard a messenger arrived
at the Royal Secretariat.

562
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,600
Is that why?

563
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,786
You must have your hands full
with the State Council business,

564
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,056
but now you want to look
into the Royal Secretariat?

565
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,156
Why? Is it a secret?

566
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,250
Of course not.

567
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,550
But I should report to His Majesty first,
don't you agree?

568
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,060
Something must have happened
to the royal agent.

569
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,560
Is this true?

570
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,776
Royal Secret Agent Park Cheolgyu
was murdered,

571
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,680
and the royal agent who was investigating
has been taken to a labor camp?

572
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,040
Murdering a royal agent is an act
of defiance against the throne.

573
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,826
Hurry and send a seonjeonkwan

574
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:14,120
to apprehend the traitor Kang Inchung
and his son Kang Jonggil!

575
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,836
How dare you speak
to your master that way?

576
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,996
I learned it from you!

577
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,566
I am your master! What did you say?

578
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,760
You!

579
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,700
Stop it right now!

580
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,406
You fools asking for a beating or what?

581
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:35,116
My life is miserable
because I have a bad master!

582
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,976
I treated you with respect and...

583
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,646
How dare they!

584
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:39,547
Unlock the door.

585
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:42,156
You still think you are a nobleman?

586
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,286
What?

587
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,426
Show some respect!

588
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,556
I could die any moment,
so why should I?

589
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,780
How dare you!

590
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,020
Good job.

591
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,000
You must return before dawn.

592
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,770
Our lives depend on you.

593
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,230
I promise to return.

594
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,146
Chunsam, come.

595
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,200
Yes, Igyeom, let's go.

596
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,840
I apologize.

597
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,440
Let us go, sir.

598
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:31,360
There really is a girl here.

599
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,190
Who are you?

600
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,600
Yes, if you don't put up a fight,
it's no fun.

601
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,340
How dare you!

602
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,010
You bastard! Stop it!

603
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,350
Dain, Dain!

604
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,326
Dain, pull yourself together.

605
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,350
Lord Choi!

606
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,190
Dain! Dain!

607
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,750
Dain, what happened?

608
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,920
I don't know.

609
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,020
That was really close.

610
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,170
The numbing drug has worked.

611
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,986
We must find Lord Seong. We must hurry.

612
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,010
Yes.

613
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,790
Just how much did they drink?

614
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,430
Sir, we are here.

615
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,460
If we get through that gate,
we can get out.

616
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,506
Let's go.

617
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,530
Yes.

618
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,170
Kang Jonggil?

619
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,150
Where are the guards?

620
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,550
What a mess.

621
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,436
A courtesan named Honglang
is hiding here somewhere.

622
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,206
Search everywhere and find her.

623
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,230
Honglang?

624
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,600
Is he talking about Dain?

625
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,276
You come with me.

626
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,300
Yes, sir.

627
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,810
What is this?

628
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,430
Intruders!

629
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,440
Hey, you!

630
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,180
Have you seen a girl here?

631
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
- No.
- Yes.

632
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,750
What?

633
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:48,650
- No.
- Yes.

634
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,450
Yes, I saw one.

635
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,036
Where? Where did you see her?

636
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,100
- Over there.
- Over there.

637
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,430
Where?

638
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,700
Is she really here?

639
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,070
Sir.

640
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:14,856
Tell me!

641
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,586
Sir!

642
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,610
What?

643
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,760
It's you again.

644
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,030
What are you waiting for?

645
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,870
Whoever brings me his head
will be awarded with gold.

646
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,810
Sir.

647
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,150
Chunsam, draw your sword.

648
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,580
What?

649
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
Sure.

650
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,970
What are you waiting for?

651
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,600
Attack them!

652
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,010
Lord Seong?

653
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,680
Lord Igyeom!

654
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,380
Who's there?

655
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,390
Do you know a man named Seong Igyeom?

656
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,360
We are here to find him.

657
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,006
Do not be alarmed.

658
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,606
We are his entourage.

659
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,306
Entourage?

660
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:50,176
Did the man named
Seong Igyeom send you?

661
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Yes.

662
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,910
But where is he?

663
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,050
He left a little earlier,
saying he will bring men.

664
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,880
So, who is he anyway?

665
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:28,380
Sir!

666
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,580
Isn't this when you say,

667
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,660
"Here come the royal secret agent," no?

668
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,960
I would love to hear it.

669
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,230
Shout it out loud.

670
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,616
Here comes the royal secret agent!

671
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,786
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

672
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,690
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

673
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,930
Yes, I am a royal secret agent.

674
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,840
Look at me.

675
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,740
Will a royal agent kill a man?

676
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,910
Are you sure you are a man?

677
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,850
What's going on?

678
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,580
Out of my way!

679
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,060
You!

680
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,470
You filthy insects...

681
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,170
Get them!

682
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:00,776
Fight!

683
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Go!

684
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:26,336
Are you okay?

685
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,360
Yes.

686
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:41,186
Run!

687
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,786
Dain!

688
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:42,810
No!

689
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,580
Dain!

690
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:45,610
Sir!

691
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
Sir!

692
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,490
Dain!

693
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:21,850
Come!

694
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:35,830
Darn it.

695
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,200
Give up.

696
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,970
You cannot escape.

697
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,740
Let her go.

698
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,210
Fine. I will let her go.

699
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,080
Dain!

700
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,750
Here.

701
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,760
Do not let go.

702
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,300
Lord Seong, it's hopeless.

703
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,210
Let go of me.

704
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,630
Lord Seong!

705
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,270
No!

706
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:17,560
[Royal Secret Agent]

707
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:18,766
Why are you crying?

708
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,926
I once asked Dain about you.

709
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,466
She said you treat
your subordinates as friends

710
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,166
and protect the weak.

711
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,096
Dain is good at reading people.

712
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,667
She must be.

713
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:29,606
She saw something I never did.

714
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,006
He has the trust of the king,

715
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,506
so he will become our enemy in the future.

716
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:35,676
Do you know the easiest way
of defeating your enemy?

717
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,776
Work for me.

718
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,946
Miok, are you out there?

719
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,116
Marriage?

720
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:39,917
That's great.

721
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:41,586
You got promoted,
and now you're getting married.

722
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,690
I offer my congratulations.

723
01:02:42,714 --> 01:02:44,714
