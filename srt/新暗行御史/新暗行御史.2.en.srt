1
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:07,763
I am Hong Dain...

2
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:13,569
The scoundrel?

3
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:15,263
What? Scoundrel?

4
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:18,633
Wait, you're...

5
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:20,703
Honglang?

6
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,513
You're the royal secret agent?

7
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,367
You... You!

8
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:32,237
There she is. Get her!

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,277
Who are they?

10
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:38,577
Run!

11
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,217
[Episode 2]

12
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:49,493
Sir, why are we running?

13
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,617
I don't know!

14
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:58,327
This way, this way!

15
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:24,117
Who are they?

16
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:25,327
Well...

17
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:29,257
By the way, are you really
the royal secret agent?

18
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,497
Here, look. Satisfied?

19
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:41,437
I was expecting someone grand
but I guess not.

20
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:43,237
What?

21
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:47,753
Has the Chief Royal Secretary really send
a courtesan to accompany me?

22
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:50,977
A courtesan? I'm a female police.

23
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:53,087
A female police?

24
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,517
Not a hostess?

25
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,663
A hostess?

26
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,387
Are you trying to cross the line?

27
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,773
Then explain to me

28
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:03,897
why you are being chased in daylight.

29
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:08,597
They must have figured out what I am.

30
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:10,797
What did you do?

31
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:14,837
My job was to keep an eye
on the Chief State Councilor.

32
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:18,877
You could be executed for that!

33
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:25,017
We lost her.

34
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:29,767
Let us return to the courtesan house.

35
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:33,233
I must apprehend the Head Courtesan.

36
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:34,257
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:02:34,427 --> 00:02:36,357
Let me properly introduce myself to you.

38
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:39,567
I am Hong Dain, here to join
your entourage.

39
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:44,867
It was the Chief Royal Secretary's order.

40
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:59,893
You will need a woman to carry out
your secret mission,

41
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,487
so I am sending a female police.

42
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,356
Have her infiltrate the courtesan house
and find the girl the agent wanted to see.

43
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,173
She's in possession of key evidence.

44
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:09,327
So...

45
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,067
He sent you?

46
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,197
That is correct.

47
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,953
Completing the mission aside,

48
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:26,147
I am unsure of a woman being able
to survive the journey to our destination.

49
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:29,293
Let me tell you in advance.

50
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:31,923
If you fall behind
or hinder the progress of my journey,

51
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,093
I will leave you behind.

52
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:37,063
And on top of that, from now on,
I will be giving orders.

53
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,157
Do you understand?

54
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:43,497
Yes, sir. I will not forget.

55
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:06,317
After all we have done,
she is still not talking.

56
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,917
I don't think she knows anything.

57
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:10,317
Wake her.

58
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,727
Please don't kill me.

59
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:22,473
Please let me go, my lord.

60
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:25,037
Let me ask you one last time.

61
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,007
Who put you up to this?

62
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:29,407
What do you mean?

63
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:32,947
Please let me go.

64
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,817
Please let me go, my lord.

65
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:41,234
Father.

66
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:44,527
Make sure this does not leak
and get rid of any evidence.

67
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:46,227
Yes, Father.

68
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,977
What's that?
What is that over there?

69
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:02,997
Sir!

70
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:05,737
This is so nice and cool.
Come and join me.

71
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:18,686
You are acting like a fool.

72
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,686
A gentleman must always mind his manners.

73
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:28,257
Let us go before the sun goes down.

74
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:32,267
We should look for a place
to spend the night around here.

75
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,067
Sir, here's a deserted house.

76
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,567
It looks haunted.

77
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,553
Take the master bedroom.

78
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,183
I will take the small one.

79
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,847
I said I will give the orders!

80
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,263
You take the small room.
We will take the master bedroom.

81
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,417
That's what she just said.

82
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:59,227
Anyway, goodnight.

83
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,357
Goodnight, Lady Dain.

84
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:18,607
Ma'am... Ma'am...

85
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,217
Unbelievable.

86
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:39,827
Oh!

87
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:43,597
What do I do?

88
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,137
What is he doing?

89
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:05,787
Oh!

90
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:20,197
Oh, how refreshing!

91
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,337
Oh, whatever. I should leave.

92
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:51,667
Wait, you... You!

93
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:54,767
Sir.

94
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:11,787
I will leave first
so please close your eyes.

95
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,217
S-Sure.

96
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:19,987
Close them tightly.

97
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,097
If you open them, I will kill you.

98
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:47,547
Are you all right?

99
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,397
You couldn't have been born
a female police.

100
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:02,837
How did you become one?

101
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:05,767
It was not my choice.

102
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:08,714
Then?

103
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:13,047
The Chief Royal Secretary
made me into a female police.

104
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:15,377
How do you know him in the first place?

105
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:17,847
He took me in.

106
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,317
And saved my life.

107
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,857
Is there a story behind that?

108
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,197
Father!

109
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:33,103
I will return soon.

110
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,737
Give me a few days.

111
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,467
Mother...

112
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:56,887
It has been a long time,
so I don't remember very well.

113
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:00,927
Our clothes are dry so let us go back now.

114
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:04,997
He must have sent you
because he trusts you,

115
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:07,127
but I don't know anything about you.

116
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:11,097
Is even Hong Dain your real name?

117
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,407
Is that important?

118
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:20,977
I need to know who you are
to be able to trust you.

119
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:25,647
Just because you know someone
doesn't mean you can trust them.

120
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,663
By the looks of how hesitant you are,

121
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,257
I guess you have something to hide.

122
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,273
That night when you were
at the courtesan house,

123
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,197
you didn't look that honest either.

124
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,337
It is wrong to judge a man
by his appearance.

125
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,933
You don't know
what kind of a man I am on the inside,

126
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:47,977
so I forgive you.

127
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:05,387
I want to avenge the death of my parents
for they were innocent.

128
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:34,023
The late king's nephew Lee Han,
Prince Hwiyeong,

129
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:41,427
took his own life while being transported
to Hanyang under the royal order

130
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:46,497
for the charge of conspiring
to commit treason.

131
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:02,217
Only a single line of record
for a major incident

132
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:07,147
such as Prince Hwiyeong's death...

133
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:35,777
I heard someone was killed by the beast
after going to get firewood.

134
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:38,293
I am miserable because it comes down

135
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:41,893
to the village every night to eat
and destroy all my crops.

136
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,293
We barely have enough to pay taxes
to the government office,

137
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,663
and now we must deal with a wild boar.

138
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:51,703
Isn't that wild boar being just like
the Big Sheriff and the Little Sheriff?

139
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:54,637
Oh, stop it. What if someone hears you?

140
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:57,767
Let's go.

141
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:07,047
A wild boar that kills people...

142
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:10,593
Let us visit the government office.

143
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:11,617
Yes, sir.

144
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:19,233
This is the place

145
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:21,373
the Special Advisor wrote about
in his journal.

146
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:24,203
I don't see anything special though.

147
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,673
We will find out once we investigate.

148
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,027
Make way!

149
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:46,693
Pardon me, who is that man?

150
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:49,717
Don't you know the Little Sheriff?

151
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,663
A sheriff is a sheriff,
so what's a little sheriff?

152
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,357
How frustrating.

153
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:57,027
He is the son of the Sheriff.

154
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:01,367
In this town, the Little Sheriff is king.
Do you understand?

155
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:16,593
Sir, what should we do?

156
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:17,817
First...

157
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,217
Let us eat.

158
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,857
Yes, sir.

159
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,643
Sir, what should we do first?

160
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,473
Let's arrest all the corrupt officials.

161
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:36,497
Silly man.

162
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,437
Making such a fuss will lead to mistakes,
don't you know?

163
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,383
Chunsam, meet with the villagers
and find out how they feel.

164
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:45,822
There must be problems.

165
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:46,883
Yes, sir.

166
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:47,907
Honglang...

167
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:53,163
I mean, Dain, go to the courtesan house
and find the girl named Sawol

168
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:55,517
and find out where the Royal Agent is.

169
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,393
Yes, sir.

170
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,557
Then what will you be doing?

171
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:01,897
I am...

172
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:07,027
Thinking of making a friend.

173
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:15,907
Enjoy your stay.

174
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:22,747
Oh.

175
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,087
Oh, nice.

176
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:31,017
I will be able to sleep
comfortably tonight.

177
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:33,287
Oh, how nice.

178
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,043
Why are you guys standing around
so awkwardly?

179
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,797
Are you uncomfortable?

180
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:42,297
No.

181
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,907
How dare you lie down like that?
Where are your manners?

182
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:50,453
Oh! I can sleep out in the dog house,

183
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:52,607
so you two can sleep in comfort here.

184
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:55,023
- Chunsam!
- Chunsam!

185
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,947
What is it? What?

186
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,533
We have a full day tomorrow,

187
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:05,157
so rest here in comfort.

188
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,287
What he said.

189
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:22,807
Sunae!

190
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:30,977
Sunae...

191
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,503
What is it?

192
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,327
What is going on?

193
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:46,903
Oh, he is dreaming.

194
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,873
He does that sometimes
so don't worry about it.

195
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:52,283
He was calling for someone.

196
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:53,967
Sun, Sunae?

197
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:56,977
It's Sunae. A long time ago...

198
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:00,653
It's better if you don't know.

199
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:03,177
And pretend not to know anything.

200
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:11,203
He is calling for a woman
even in his dream.

201
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,857
I am in disbelief.

202
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,367
Oh, we are losing daylight.

203
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:31,677
You don't know anything about women.

204
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:38,263
It takes women a long time to do anything.

205
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,647
So men must be patient.

206
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:50,697
How much longer...

207
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:30,597
Is that really Lady Dain?

208
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,077
She's like a fairy.

209
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:38,577
Don't you agree, sir?

210
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:44,487
Don't be silly!
Not everyone in a dress is a fairy!

211
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:48,087
We cannot waste anymore time
so hurry up.

212
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,663
Dain, follow me.

213
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:51,687
Yes, sir.

214
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:56,297
I can't stand him.

215
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,967
What do you think?
She's a true fairy, no?

216
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,643
She can dance beautifully,

217
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:07,537
and she plays the gayageum
better than Hwang Jini.

218
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,837
Everyone can do that.

219
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:20,517
Twirl around.

220
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:26,627
Say "ah."

221
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:28,527
Ah.

222
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:36,467
My goodness.

223
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:42,537
Not bad.

224
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:46,047
So, how much do you want?

225
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:57,287
Two thousand coins.

226
00:21:58,787 --> 00:21:59,887
Two thousand?

227
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:01,833
Two hundred, two hundred.

228
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,973
Is that a joke?

229
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:06,278
You could buy this courtesan house
for two thousand coins.

230
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,043
Are you mad?

231
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:15,053
I didn't say two thousand.
I said two hundred. Hundred.

232
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:16,207
You said two thousand.

233
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:23,077
Here, two hundred coins.

234
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,817
I am being generous.

235
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,957
You are not as expensive as I thought.

236
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:36,227
Take her.

237
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:39,103
Come with me.

238
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:40,127
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,167
Oh no.

240
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:50,377
Sorry.

241
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,617
How rude.

242
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:04,787
You look over there. You, there.

243
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:06,104
Sir.

244
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:07,263
Keep looking.

245
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:11,167
Please show mercy
for the sake of my children.

246
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,443
My mercy has limits.

247
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:16,273
Do you know how much tax you owe?

248
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:20,737
Sir, my husband's 49th day
memorial rite has just finished.

249
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:26,223
So how can you charge military tax
to a dead man?

250
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:29,547
Your husband is not the only one
on the military roster.

251
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:31,547
What?

252
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:41,063
My little boys must serve in the military?

253
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:41,804
What?

254
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:44,443
They have nothing,
not even a bowl of rice.

255
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:45,467
What?

256
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:47,527
Damn it.

257
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:51,013
Fine. I will give you one more day.

258
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:52,913
Unless you pay,

259
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:55,237
I will sell your children!

260
00:23:57,007 --> 00:23:59,383
No, sir, not my children,

261
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:00,783
please, sir, have mercy.

262
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:01,993
Stop it!

263
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:03,653
- Mom!
- Mom!

264
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:04,887
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:08,657
Mom.

266
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:11,457
That bastard.

267
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:15,257
Mom.

268
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:26,737
She is new. Her name is...

269
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:28,507
What was it?

270
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:31,847
I am Honglang.

271
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,003
All good?

272
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,717
Now play nice.

273
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:44,117
Honglang?
Your name is so tasteless.

274
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:48,427
Hey, come here.

275
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:54,367
Geez, it's the same everywhere.

276
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:02,907
Why? Are you the boss here?

277
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:05,277
How dare you!

278
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,317
How did you survive with a face like that?

279
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,387
You should clean the toilet for now.

280
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:25,567
Then I should start with your hole.

281
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:27,837
What did you eat today?

282
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:31,037
What? You little...

283
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,757
I'm going hunting.
Do you have anything nice?

284
00:25:54,497 --> 00:25:56,157
What are you planning on hunting?

285
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,367
I am planning on hunting a wild boar.

286
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,777
You don't look like a hunter.

287
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,977
Do not judge a man by his appearance.

288
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:29,227
This is steel tip arrow I made myself.

289
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:30,973
Steel tip arrow?

290
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:34,613
I make these only for special orders,

291
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:37,907
but you could kill a wild boar
with one strike with this.

292
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:54,017
Lift them up.

293
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,417
Hey, lift them up higher.

294
00:26:57,757 --> 00:26:58,957
Lift them up high.

295
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:01,087
Seriously.

296
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:06,467
Hey, you.

297
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,637
What?

298
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:12,037
Is there a girl named Sawol here?

299
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:16,253
Sawol? Why do you want her?

300
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:18,107
Just answer me.

301
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:20,977
Where is Sawol?

302
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:26,723
Sawol cannot work right now.

303
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:27,747
Why not?

304
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:32,957
After she got pregnant,
she has been mentally unstable.

305
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:34,627
Pregnant?

306
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:43,574
Who are you?

307
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:46,837
Are you Sawol?

308
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:09,557
Didn't you meet a royal secret agent?

309
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:12,467
Get out!

310
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:25,907
Sir.

311
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:27,607
Oh, sir.

312
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:31,287
Sir, where are you going?

313
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:32,717
You will see.

314
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:35,893
What are you going to use the bow for?

315
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,833
And what is this hoe for?

316
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,487
Nothing beats a gift
when trying to make a friend.

317
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,297
Wait.

318
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:53,013
Dig a hole over there
big enough for a man to lie down.

319
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,037
What?

320
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:57,113
What are you planning on burying there?

321
00:28:57,137 --> 00:29:00,077
And why are we here?

322
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,647
I came to bury you.

323
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,617
What?

324
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:30,218
I heard Kim Manhui and his minions
were chasing after you.

325
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:31,884
Yes.

326
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,447
Did they discover your identity?

327
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:36,443
They saw our faces,

328
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,547
but they didn't seem
to know much about us.

329
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:42,117
That concerns me.

330
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:44,963
I will let the Chief Royal Secretary know,

331
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:46,563
so you keep a close eye
on the Royal Agent

332
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,197
and report everything.

333
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:50,357
He is unpredictable.

334
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:52,873
I agree.

335
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:55,913
I think I've met every type
of nobleman out there,

336
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:57,473
but he is unlike any other.

337
00:29:57,497 --> 00:30:00,107
Why? Did something happen?

338
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:06,323
He looks sane one moment
but mad the next,

339
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,817
and he looks mad one moment
but sane the next.

340
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:11,787
I cannot read him.

341
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:13,687
I see.

342
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,713
As the poem goes, the bright moon
is filling the empty mountains.

343
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:46,673
You seem very relaxed.

344
00:30:46,697 --> 00:30:48,613
This is no time to sit around.

345
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:50,383
You should go and see for yourself.

346
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:54,053
You have no idea how much suffering
these people are experiencing

347
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:57,153
because the officials are taxing
everyone, even children and the dead.

348
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:58,847
You really have no idea.

349
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,263
Forget it.

350
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,209
Where are you going?

351
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:05,173
I'm going to pee.

352
00:31:06,103 --> 00:31:07,203
I'm going.

353
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,149
It is sensitive to smell and sound

354
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:11,673
so make sure you go far away.

355
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:14,313
Sure, sure, Royal Agent, sir.

356
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:41,173
Geez, who goes hunting at night?

357
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:27,059
Help! Help!

358
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,429
Help Chunsam!

359
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:30,253
It's a wild boar!

360
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:31,853
No!

361
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:34,023
Help!

362
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:48,073
Sir, the boar, the boar!
The wild boar!

363
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:52,573
Sir! Help Chunsam! Help!

364
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,693
Get out of my way.

365
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:10,893
Get out of my way!

366
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:29,083
Whoa, I thought I was dead.

367
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:31,713
This one is enormous.

368
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:33,813
What are you going to do with this?

369
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:36,553
I told you. It's a gift.

370
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:38,453
What?

371
00:33:53,473 --> 00:33:57,673
So this is the one that was causing
a havoc in my town?

372
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:03,219
So, who caught this?

373
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:06,053
Sir, it is he.

374
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:10,553
I am Seong Igyeom.

375
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:16,493
Oh, so you caught
this monster by yourself?

376
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:23,439
By the looks of it,
you are not from this town, are you?

377
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,929
I was passing through

378
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:27,009
when I heard of
the mountain boar harming people,

379
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,342
and I wanted to be of help.

380
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:33,019
That is truly praiseworthy.

381
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:34,543
I caught it, I did.

382
00:34:36,513 --> 00:34:38,913
And what were you doing all this time?

383
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:44,183
You went through much trouble
so relax and enjoy yourself today.

384
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:48,293
I am honored, thank you.

385
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,439
Keep this hidden.

386
00:34:55,463 --> 00:34:56,479
The horse requisition tablet?

387
00:34:56,503 --> 00:34:58,649
Why are you giving this to me?

388
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:01,419
I don't want my identity to be discovered.

389
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:04,243
The Royal Agent was investigating
the father and son duo.

390
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:06,849
They must be hiding something.

391
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:08,313
I am going to find out what that is.

392
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:11,043
Yes, sir.

393
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,123
Do you have a plan?

394
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:19,653
You must enter the tiger's lair
to catch a tiger.

395
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:23,163
A true royal agent
does not fear for his life.

396
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,293
I am touched.

397
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:32,173
Please enjoy the feast.

398
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:33,703
Thank you.

399
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:43,843
Sir!

400
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,163
You must be new.
Come and sit next to me.

401
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:04,533
You serve him.

402
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:15,013
I am Honglang.

403
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:17,783
Let me pour you a drink.

404
00:36:18,513 --> 00:36:19,513
Thank you.

405
00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:22,883
What are you doing here?

406
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:24,153
- I...
- Here.

407
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:26,753
Let us drink.

408
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:30,823
Of course.

409
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,303
Bring more wine!

410
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:44,813
Yes, sir.

411
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:46,713
Stay.

412
00:36:50,143 --> 00:36:53,113
Let me pour you a drink.

413
00:36:57,453 --> 00:36:59,853
Oh, I must be drunk.
My hands are slippery.

414
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:01,893
I do apologize.

415
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:07,833
It is fine.

416
00:37:09,863 --> 00:37:11,533
Bring me water to clean my clothes.

417
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:15,203
We will bring new food.

418
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,303
Come.

419
00:37:18,313 --> 00:37:21,273
But I should help clean...

420
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:24,313
I apologize.

421
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,129
What are you doing?

422
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:32,893
Wasn't it obvious?
I was teaching the pervert a lesson.

423
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:35,499
Are you here to enjoy yourself?

424
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:37,539
Oh, do not misunderstand.

425
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:38,833
I am here on official business.

426
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:40,263
Official business?

427
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:43,509
You couldn't stop smiling,
sitting between two courtesans.

428
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,909
Why didn't you dance
like the last time?

429
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,879
I was acting.

430
00:37:47,903 --> 00:37:48,880
Couldn't you tell?

431
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:53,473
No, your acting was so natural
that I couldn't tell it was acting.

432
00:37:54,743 --> 00:37:56,383
Do you think anyone can be a royal agent?

433
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:12,363
Enjoy.

434
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,063
Father!

435
00:38:17,203 --> 00:38:18,549
No, I'm not your father.

436
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:19,703
Who are you?

437
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:24,243
Oh, good boy.

438
00:38:25,313 --> 00:38:26,943
What is this for?

439
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:30,213
It's nothing much...

440
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:36,083
Did you do hard labor
with my late husband?

441
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:37,799
Hard labor?

442
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:40,223
No one has returned alive from there,

443
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:44,363
but you look perfectly well.

444
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:46,993
Let me see.

445
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:53,203
Did you put together something
for me to collect?

446
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,343
Not yet.

447
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:57,673
Please give me a few more days.

448
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,313
I have given you many chances!

449
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:01,243
Hey, grab the boys.

450
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:02,160
Yes, sir.

451
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:04,483
No! Please!

452
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:05,660
Who are you?

453
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:08,729
This is too much.

454
00:39:08,753 --> 00:39:09,853
This is robbery!

455
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:13,969
How dare you call
legitimate tax collecting robbery?

456
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:15,023
What? Legitimate?

457
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,409
Oh, that is a pile of dung.

458
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:19,869
Dung?

459
00:39:19,893 --> 00:39:21,193
Apprehend him!

460
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:22,633
Yes, sir.

461
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,539
Hey, hey, hey, apprehend whom? Let go.

462
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:25,563
Let go of me!

463
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,003
Goodness, no.

464
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:35,843
Horse requisition tablet?

465
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:38,263
A horse requisition tablet!

466
00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:40,430
That's a horse requisition tablet!

467
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:42,853
No, no, this isn't
a horse requisition tablet.

468
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:44,283
I am sorry.

469
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:08,783
Here comes the royal secret agent!

470
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,153
Oh!

471
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:22,923
Please spare us!

472
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:30,909
Instead of trying to help
this poor family,

473
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,679
what do you think you're doing?

474
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:35,479
We are just following orders.

475
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:38,089
What? Following orders?

476
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:41,813
You treacherous little men!

477
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:45,189
I will give you one last chance,

478
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:48,253
so do not show your faces here!

479
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:49,630
Do you understand?

480
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:50,759
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

481
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:54,693
If I hear rumors of a royal secret agent
appearing in this town,

482
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:57,399
I will find you

483
00:40:57,423 --> 00:40:59,133
and tear your limbs apart.

484
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:00,693
Have I made myself clear?

485
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:01,979
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

486
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:03,479
We will never forget!

487
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,703
Then get out of here!

488
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:06,173
Yes, sir, yes.

489
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:07,479
Go!

490
00:41:07,503 --> 00:41:08,080
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

491
00:41:08,104 --> 00:41:09,519
Leave!

492
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:11,043
Get out of here!

493
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:28,223
Hello, hello.

494
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,463
So...

495
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:34,263
I will go and pee.

496
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:48,119
You are very reckless.

497
00:41:48,143 --> 00:41:50,543
You did this
to become friends with that man?

498
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,613
Did you find Sawol?

499
00:41:54,953 --> 00:41:57,699
Well, I did find her,

500
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,269
but there is a problem.

501
00:41:59,293 --> 00:42:00,493
What do you mean?

502
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:05,133
She is pregnant, and she looked
as if she is out of her mind.

503
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:09,179
Did she remember
meeting the Royal Agent?

504
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:12,333
Bringing that up made her
raise her guard against me.

505
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:13,773
Maybe...

506
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,629
You seemed to had too much to drink,

507
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:27,213
so why don't we call it a day?

508
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:33,523
Who are you?

509
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:39,863
You seem very drunk. Let us go.

510
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:46,633
You caught a wild boar
while passing through?

511
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:50,343
Did you honest think I would believe that?

512
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:56,613
I saw a mark, and I could not let it go.

513
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:04,899
You are very full of yourself.

514
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:06,353
I like you.

515
00:43:06,823 --> 00:43:07,893
Come with me.

516
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,393
I want to take you somewhere.

517
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:13,693
Where is that?

518
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:19,533
I will show you something interesting.

519
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:27,273
Sure.

520
00:43:30,213 --> 00:43:32,059
Don't go.

521
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,213
I'm getting a bad feeling.

522
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:37,683
Are you concerned about me?

523
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:41,699
This isn't out of concern.

524
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:43,699
I fear you might make a mess of things.

525
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:46,133
Nothing can be done without taking risks.

526
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:48,533
That goes for both you and me.

527
00:44:03,543 --> 00:44:05,353
Sir!

528
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,723
E-Enter.

529
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:17,093
We are in big trouble, sir.

530
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:20,833
A royal agent, a royal secret agent
is here.

531
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,803
What? A royal secret agent?

532
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:25,633
Are you certain?

533
00:44:25,773 --> 00:44:27,079
I am.

534
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:30,719
I saw the horse requisition tablet
with my own two eyes.

535
00:44:30,743 --> 00:44:34,043
And his manner of speaking and behavior...

536
00:44:35,613 --> 00:44:37,313
He is a royal secret agent for sure.

537
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:39,953
Bring me my wagon.

538
00:44:40,413 --> 00:44:42,959
No, no, no! Get my horse ready!

539
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,683
Yes, sir.

540
00:44:51,193 --> 00:44:52,493
Are there animals to hunt here?

541
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:54,763
Just wait.

542
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:02,873
Who is he?

543
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,013
He attacked a nobleman to steal food.

544
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:11,553
Why should I let a beast of a man live?

545
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,959
So what are you going to do?

546
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:18,253
Do you know the best kind of hunting?

547
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:21,253
It is human hunting.

548
00:45:24,163 --> 00:45:25,163
Let him go.

549
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:33,103
Do you know who I am?

550
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:37,450
Punishment for kangsangjoe is death,

551
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:38,819
[Kangsangjoe: Crime of disobeying
the moral code designated by Confucianism]

552
00:45:38,843 --> 00:45:41,483
but I will show you mercy.

553
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:47,353
If you get to escape past that target,

554
00:45:48,423 --> 00:45:49,823
you are free.

555
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:53,623
Go.

556
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:00,093
Run!

557
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,213
It's your turn now.

558
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:21,153
Hurry. He will escape.

559
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:27,453
Do you want to let him go?

560
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,163
Hurry.

561
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:58,753
You are fantastic, sir.

562
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:02,493
We almost missed him.

563
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:07,833
Why? Does that peasant scare you
more than a wild boar?

564
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:13,349
Get rid of him.

565
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,373
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

566
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:26,583
Tell your captain that I am here.

567
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:35,363
The government has sent
another royal secret agent.

568
00:47:36,393 --> 00:47:38,063
What should I do?

569
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:41,679
Whoever gave the order,

570
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:43,903
they are moving faster
than I had anticipated.

571
00:47:46,103 --> 00:47:47,833
Royal secret agents.

572
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:52,473
They are pesky little things,
like mosquitoes.

573
00:47:53,113 --> 00:47:56,219
Do not mind him and make him join us.

574
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:58,483
You mean bribe him?

575
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:01,829
What if there is a problem?

576
00:48:01,853 --> 00:48:03,429
What else could we do?

577
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:05,423
Then there will be bloodshed.

578
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:10,693
What is the progress on recruiting
construction laborers?

579
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:15,663
Well, finding manpower is...

580
00:48:18,133 --> 00:48:20,803
What is your job?

581
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:25,089
If you cannot find a few laborers,

582
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:30,213
how could I trust you to join me
in accomplishing my great work?

583
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:33,059
Give me a little more time.

584
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:36,483
I will send people to you.

585
00:48:44,223 --> 00:48:45,223
Are you in there?

586
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:47,463
Who is it?

587
00:48:47,863 --> 00:48:50,079
I want to talk to you for a brief moment.

588
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:52,703
Don't do this. I don't know anything.

589
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,143
It's about your little brother Dongsu.

590
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:59,073
His name is Dongsu, isn't it?

591
00:49:01,443 --> 00:49:06,053
Dongsu? Do you know my little brother?

592
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:09,653
Yes, I read the journal
the Royal Agent kept.

593
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:11,553
Why was your little brother taken?

594
00:49:14,323 --> 00:49:15,869
It was them.

595
00:49:15,893 --> 00:49:17,363
They will kill everyone!

596
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,639
Whom do you mean?

597
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:20,909
Who are they going to kill?

598
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:24,233
Save my brother! He is innocent.

599
00:49:29,003 --> 00:49:30,773
Okay. Calm down.

600
00:49:31,273 --> 00:49:32,589
We can help you.

601
00:49:32,613 --> 00:49:34,313
The Royal Agent has sent me.

602
00:49:34,573 --> 00:49:35,573
Royal agent?

603
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:39,953
A new royal secret agent arrived in town.

604
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:43,583
He is staying at the tavern
so come with me.

605
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,333
Come.

606
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:32,733
What made you so scared?

607
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:56,663
What's wrong? What happened?

608
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:05,633
Bring me wine!

609
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:33,463
I'm sorry.

610
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:38,803
But we really need you.

611
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:00,723
Sawol,

612
00:52:02,163 --> 00:52:04,363
this is the journal
Lord Park Cheolgyu has left.

613
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:08,663
I hope you read it.

614
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:28,683
You're back.

615
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:30,053
Where is Jonggil?

616
00:52:31,553 --> 00:52:33,223
At the courtesan house.

617
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:36,593
What? Bring him this instant!

618
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:41,463
You had too much to drink.

619
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:44,133
Is something on your mind?

620
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:48,073
There is no need for your concern.

621
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:50,143
Pour me a drink.

622
00:52:58,213 --> 00:53:02,359
But where is the man who left with you?

623
00:53:02,383 --> 00:53:04,023
Why did you come back alone?

624
00:53:05,693 --> 00:53:09,923
For a lowly courtesan,
you ask too many questions.

625
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:19,309
Sir, there is a problem.

626
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:20,879
You must return to the government office.

627
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:22,019
What is it?

628
00:53:22,043 --> 00:53:26,773
Well, I cannot tell you here.

629
00:53:27,713 --> 00:53:28,743
Leave.

630
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:49,703
It's a royal secret agent.

631
00:53:50,863 --> 00:53:51,973
A royal secret agent?

632
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:54,103
Well, I mean...

633
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:57,473
There is a royal secret agent in town.

634
00:53:58,173 --> 00:53:59,789
How do you know?

635
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:00,949
I met him.

636
00:54:00,973 --> 00:54:03,289
That is nonsense.

637
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:04,883
He is dead.

638
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:09,059
He is dead?

639
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:12,453
Yes, he is already dead.

640
00:54:15,093 --> 00:54:16,693
But I met him this afternoon.

641
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:18,323
And he died already?

642
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:20,093
What?

643
00:54:30,343 --> 00:54:31,343
Father.

644
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,273
Enter.

645
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:44,753
There is a royal agent in town.

646
00:54:45,693 --> 00:54:49,299
Could the courtesan whose life you spared

647
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:50,963
be responsible for this?

648
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:54,733
You should have killed her.

649
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,203
Lord Seong! Chunsam!

650
00:55:32,573 --> 00:55:33,573
Lord Seong!

651
00:55:36,143 --> 00:55:37,143
Lord Seong...

652
00:55:45,013 --> 00:55:46,783
Lady Dain, is something wrong?

653
00:55:47,713 --> 00:55:50,629
Chunsam, Lord Seong is...

654
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:51,693
Yes?

655
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,799
Lord Seong is...

656
00:55:53,823 --> 00:55:54,823
Yes?

657
00:56:02,003 --> 00:56:03,003
Lord Seong!

658
00:56:05,803 --> 00:56:06,803
What is it?

659
00:56:07,303 --> 00:56:08,473
Are you all right?

660
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:10,703
I thought you were dead.

661
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:14,043
Me? Why would I die?

662
00:56:14,613 --> 00:56:16,959
Kang Jonggil said
the royal secret agent was dead.

663
00:56:16,983 --> 00:56:18,083
What?

664
00:56:19,653 --> 00:56:21,013
So I thought you died.

665
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:24,793
The royal secret agent is dead?

666
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:27,469
So if he didn't mean you,

667
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:29,563
he must have meant the Special Advisor.

668
00:56:30,423 --> 00:56:33,363
It is too early to say.
We need evidence.

669
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:37,503
Sir, you should report this
to the palace tomorrow morning.

670
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:46,589
Since you are safe,

671
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:48,243
I will return to the courtesan house.

672
00:56:56,753 --> 00:56:57,859
Are you going to let her go alone?

673
00:56:57,883 --> 00:56:59,999
Do you expect me to go with her?

674
00:57:00,023 --> 00:57:01,539
Of course.

675
00:57:01,563 --> 00:57:04,863
You really don't know anything
about women, do you?

676
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:07,309
She is a proud woman,
but her eyes welled up

677
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,809
because of you,
and you still don't see it?

678
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,433
And now you're sending her back alone?

679
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:15,949
How frustrating. Suit yourself.

680
00:57:15,973 --> 00:57:16,949
You can be so dry.

681
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:17,973
Hey.

682
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,213
Dain!

683
00:57:28,953 --> 00:57:29,953
Dain.

684
00:57:35,323 --> 00:57:36,723
What is it?

685
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:39,463
It is dark so I will walk you there.

686
00:57:39,763 --> 00:57:40,763
Pardon me?

687
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:44,773
Is this a part of your official business?

688
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:51,073
Of course it is. Official business.

689
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:56,483
Come.

690
00:58:09,663 --> 00:58:12,339
By the way, Dain,

691
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,203
were you crying
because you thought I was dead?

692
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:19,903
What? Cried? Who cried?

693
00:58:20,433 --> 00:58:21,743
You did.

694
00:58:22,473 --> 00:58:23,473
What?

695
00:58:24,503 --> 00:58:26,949
I did not! I didn't.

696
00:58:26,973 --> 00:58:29,943
And why is that so important?

697
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:31,813
How infuriating.

698
00:58:37,423 --> 00:58:38,653
It made me happy,

699
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:45,663
knowing there is a person

700
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:47,993
who would cry for me when I'm dead.

701
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:11,553
Sawol.

702
00:59:12,293 --> 00:59:13,353
Sawol?

703
00:59:17,723 --> 00:59:21,533
Sawol, what are you doing here?

704
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:30,903
Don't worry.
This is the royal secret agent.

705
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:34,843
Don't be afraid.

706
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:47,889
What happened?

707
01:00:47,913 --> 01:00:49,553
What happened here?

708
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:54,823
You saw something, didn't you?

709
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:02,033
Tell us what you saw.

710
01:01:19,653 --> 01:01:20,713
That night...

711
01:01:26,823 --> 01:01:27,823
Sawol!

712
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:29,623
Sawol!

713
01:01:30,393 --> 01:01:31,393
Sawol.

714
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:32,533
Sawol.

715
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,733
Who's there?

716
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,603
Stay with me, Sawol.

717
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:43,073
My baby. Please save my baby.

718
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:52,113
Sawol.

719
01:01:52,513 --> 01:01:54,283
Sawol, stay with me, Sawol!

720
01:02:24,553 --> 01:02:27,381
[Royal Secret Agent]

721
01:02:27,466 --> 01:02:28,969
What is it that you saw?

722
01:02:28,993 --> 01:02:30,599
Why did you take us there?

723
01:02:30,623 --> 01:02:32,639
I warned you never to show your face again

724
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:33,769
in this place!

725
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:36,739
The Sheriff asked me to bring you
with utmost care.

726
01:02:36,763 --> 01:02:37,979
You crazy idiot!

727
01:02:38,003 --> 01:02:39,309
If Lord Igyeom finds out, you're finished.

728
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,679
The only witness is dead.

729
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:42,119
They are destroying any and all evidence.

730
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:43,719
He is an expert archer.

731
01:02:43,743 --> 01:02:45,389
Do you have an idea who it is?

732
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:48,389
When you get him drunk and ask,
he might tell you something.

733
01:02:48,413 --> 01:02:49,419
I will deal with him.

734
01:02:49,443 --> 01:02:50,189
It's too dangerous.

735
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:51,020
I'm Honglang.

736
01:02:51,044 --> 01:02:54,153
Winning over a man's heart
is a piece of cake.
