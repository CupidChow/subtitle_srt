So big.

73
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:49,730
The meaning of Vivarkada is
a group of friends formed in Viva.

74
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,465
Of course, friends.

75
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,734
Is friendship and community.

76
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:55,969
More than just a group of friends.

77
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:56,637
Family!

78
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,038
My Viva family.

79
00:07:58,038 --> 00:07:58,842
Achievement.

80
00:07:58,867 --> 00:07:59,868
Good Energy.

81
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:00,973
Unity.

82
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:10,017
Vivarkada as a whole, is the
celebration of all the artists

83
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:13,745
who are featured in the
Hit Series of VivaOne.

84
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:16,823
It wasn't like when we started The Rain,

85
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:19,993
Uhmm, we didn’t really
expect it to turn into Vivarkada.

86
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:22,229
I feel like it just happened naturally.

87
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,231
And at first, it was Univerkada.

88
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,832
The pressure back then was really tough,

89
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:28,735
and now with so many series coming out,

90
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:30,971
so many artists are being helped.

91
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,173
And now, here we are at the Big Dome.

92
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:37,986
Actually, this concert
is a really big deal.

93
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:40,514
Because of this Vivarkada,
we got to know each other.

94
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:44,217
I make a lot of friends, and
that’s what makes me happy.

95
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:47,654
The connection between
everyone is natural.

96
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:52,716
[overlapping chatter]

97
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:56,196
So nice to make friends
even with different ages.

98
00:08:56,196 --> 00:09:00,233
You can really feel their
good vibes, their energy.

99
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,002
Very passionate about what they do.

100
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:06,239
The bond is really solid because they guide
us since they have so much experience.

101
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:09,476
Now they’re teaching us since
it’s our first time here at Araneta.

102
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:12,540
We’re all happy to
share their talent.

103
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,099
The supporters are the best!

104
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:17,784
With that, and all the people, the
Vivarkada family, it’s such a joy!

105
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,978
Especially performing with GAT.

106
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:31,544
Vivarkada is the best friendship ever
because we treat everyone like family.

107
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,935
Uhm, a lot of us have built
a really strong relationship.

108
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:38,905
Where we really help each other create art
together and continue to grow.

109
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:42,009
It’s amazing to see everyone together,

110
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,679
celebrating and having
fun at Araneta for Vivarkada!

111
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,247
Even if our shows are different.

112
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:50,550
Even though the series we’ve done
together are different,

113
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,528
we come together,

114
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:56,048
and that’s how Vivarkada was
formed you know, together as one.

115
00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:02,329
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

116
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:05,632
Super happy, because it’s not just
Mutya I got to work with.

117
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:09,703
We got the chance to get to
know each other and bond.

118
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:12,305
And surprisingly, we all clicked.

119
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,140
So, super happy!

120
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,276
I was able to, you know,
create a lot of new friendships.

121
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:18,403
It’s more about supporting each other.

122
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,016
And that’s what I
cherish the most in Viva.

123
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:25,186
And it’s so nice to meet them

124
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:29,975
and work with them on a
project I’ve truly dreamed of.

125
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,389
One!

126
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:34,199
Okay, guys, go!

127
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,457
One, two!

128
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:39,941
Very, very grateful, and it’s an
honor to perform in front of everyone.

129
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,369
Wow, it’s such an
honor to be part of this.

130
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,531
Hopefully, this continues.

131
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,593
Fulfilling.

132
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,188
And full of gratitude.

133
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:52,680
Because the concert is
like a way of giving back

134
00:10:52,705 --> 00:10:54,423
to the fans.

135
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:59,553
Of course, I’m proud. We, Univerkada,
expanded, grew, and became Vivarkada.

136
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:02,055
It’s also a pride thing,
because I’m proud of it.

137
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:05,859
I’m very proud of Vivarkada and
the people who stand next to me.

138
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:10,597
And it’s fun because we’re all
grinding and helping each other.

139
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:13,533
Do your best, okay?
Do your best, bro!

140
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:19,006
I’m happy when we see them, they
don’t make us feel like they’ve matured.

141
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:22,109
They join in our fun
and joking around.

142
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:25,779
For us, we got to win because we were
able to create such a strong bond.

143
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,114
And everyone was so kind.

144
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:30,283
You can feel the atmosphere of Vivarkada.

145
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:34,021
It’s really teamwork, which is why
Vivarkada is the best friendship.

146
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:36,741
No matter where you take us, as
long as we’re together, we can do it.

147
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,861
I’m grateful to be part
of something like this.

148
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:44,865
I hope they enjoy it, and I’m just really
grateful and blessed.

149
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:47,667
We gave everything we’ve got!

150
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:53,206
Our progress is so fast, and the success
of the whole VivaOne!

151
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:57,878
Know that we are here at this
point today it’s like wow!

152
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:01,637
All the hard work we put in is
coming together just for you guys.

153
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,858
Hello, Vivarkada!

154
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:04,751
Let’s go!

155
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:05,977

Wow, the Big Dome is packed!

158
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,871
Big Dome!

159
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:27,099
Give it up to Vivarkada!

160
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:30,970
The Vivarkada!

161
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,060
This is the moment
we’ve all been waiting for.

162
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,328
The gathering of
your favorite artists.

163
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:42,956
From different Viva series.

164
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:44,524
Wow!

165
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:46,874
There are so, so many of
you here in the Big Dome!

166
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:48,970
Yes, you’re right about that, Dylan.

167
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:53,431

Let's get this party started!

232
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,668
It began with a single drop.

233
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:56,703
What's your name again?

234
00:17:56,703 --> 00:17:58,405
You can call me Love.

235
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,773

I won't stop you from leaving.

Did I make your heart
turn with my walk?

total reads on Wattpad.

246
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:27,467

you doing to end up like that?

247

That's not nice.

253
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,438
Is there no good luck there?

Yes, alternate.
Left foot, right foot.

704
01:04:00,684 --> 01:04:04,755
This show is actually made
for the fans of Viva One.

705
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,716
Those who watch Viva One shows.

706
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:12,425
All the shows in Viva One
crisscrossed in one concert.

707
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,052
And that's very exciting to see.

708
01:04:14,077 --> 01:04:17,526
The first two days, it was
me and the Univerkada.

709
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:19,034
We just practiced our prod.

710
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,687
And then this is my first
time practicing with the boys.

711
01:04:21,712 --> 01:04:26,684
Practicing an all-boys prod, and I can say
that, first time I'm handling with props.

712
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:27,972
So it's gonna be a challenge.

713
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,965
But I know that we can do it.

714
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,407
And now we'll be doing
a prod with umbrellas.

715
01:04:32,432 --> 01:04:33,514
So it’s kinda new to me.

716
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:34,984
I’ve never done a prod with umbrella.

717
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:36,811
We really looking
forward to finish the prod.

718
01:04:36,836 --> 01:04:39,012
Because the song is really
good Maharani by Alamat.

719
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:41,772
It's not difficult but this
dance is very stylish.

720
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:43,990
So we just want the timing to be good.

721
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:45,070
And throw!

722
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:48,487
There are a lot of prods that we rehearse.

723
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:50,522
Opening, closing, our solos.

724
01:04:50,547 --> 01:04:53,483
Everyday rehearsals, it
should be double effort.

725
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:56,211
Because there are a lot of prods.
I'll do eight prods.

726
01:04:56,236 --> 01:04:58,704
So I should really focus.

727
01:04:58,949 --> 01:05:01,407
For the past few days,
we've been doing rehearsals.

728
01:05:01,432 --> 01:05:04,034
It's just crazy that our bonding.

729
01:05:04,094 --> 01:05:09,399
Started in the morning, finished at night
And then we'll show to the audience.

730
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:14,396
What will be the result of the dance.
Some of us never performed.

731
01:05:14,465 --> 01:05:16,771
And we're doing this for you guys.

732
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:21,071
Since day one of our rehearsals,
I never felt left out.

733
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:25,643
I always felt like I'm included
in whatever group we are in.

734
01:05:25,643 --> 01:05:29,680
Vivarkada...
It's not just us.

735
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,548
It's like we're all with you.

736
01:05:31,548 --> 01:05:34,303
It's really fun because
it's like we're united.

737
01:05:34,616 --> 01:05:36,295
It feels great, right?

738
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,422
It's like a multiverse of VIVA ONE.

739
01:05:38,422 --> 01:05:40,366
It's like we're all together.

740
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:41,692
Well, it's not really hard.

741
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:43,727
Because we all know each other.

742
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:45,629
It's not hard for us to adjust.

743
01:05:45,629 --> 01:05:48,399
Because we're used to rehearse.

744
01:05:48,399 --> 01:05:50,705
We're all used to it every day.

745
01:05:52,456 --> 01:05:58,996
Coach Kevin is not a difficult person
to work with, especially in practice.

746
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,831
Let's say he's there as a coach,

747
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:04,965
but his vibes are
still different for us.

748
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:08,476
He’s not intimidating to work with.

749
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:12,994
I mean, he can be strict too
when we’re chasing time.

750
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:14,254
He’s really so easy to work with.

751
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:16,727
He's not a difficult person to work with.

752
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:21,862
When he teaches, he makes the dance
look easier for you to understand.

753
01:06:21,887 --> 01:06:26,419
It's fun because of course we got
to perform. We got to dance again.

754
01:06:26,444 --> 01:06:31,250
It's tiring, yes. And you know. We
really put a lot of effort and preparation.

755
01:06:31,275 --> 01:06:33,644
Because it's just a
few days of rehearsal.

756
01:06:33,669 --> 01:06:39,085
It's crazy I feel like I've felt so
many things during the concert.

757
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:44,772
We're so many, just to make
the people who support us happy.

758
01:06:44,932 --> 01:06:46,474
I'm happy to see everybody.

759
01:06:46,499 --> 01:06:50,145
And excited to perform with them.
I mean, everybody's having fun.

760
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:54,347
To perform everything they rehearsed.
I'm really excited for people to see

761
01:06:54,393 --> 01:06:55,942
everything we've prepared.

762
01:06:55,987 --> 01:06:58,979
That's what's important, we're
having fun with the process.

763
01:06:59,004 --> 01:07:02,304
I have time to spend
with my other co-artists.

764
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:05,243
We have time to catch
up at the same time.

765
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:11,902
Even if we're not in the same prod
We'll make sure that, we get along.

766
01:07:13,393 --> 01:07:17,796
We're all just excited to give you guys
something that you can all enjoy.

767
01:07:17,821 --> 01:07:19,549
And we're doing it all for everyone.

768
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:23,612
From the start of rehearsals.
It's the first time that,

769
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:26,982
I got to be with the whole VIVA family.
All the VIVA artists.

770
01:07:27,007 --> 01:07:30,477
All I have to say is I really, really
experienced the bond of BARKADA.

771
01:07:30,502 --> 01:07:32,048
During the whole rehearsal.

772
01:07:46,806 --> 01:07:49,976
Drake Palma, you're my boyfriend now!

773
01:07:51,407 --> 01:07:52,866
We’re breaking up.

774
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:57,535
I love you, Drake Palma!

775
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:03,416
Why are you here?

776
01:08:03,441 --> 01:08:05,150
Of course, I'm here
because you're here.

777
01:08:05,175 --> 01:08:07,483
I like you, Bee!

778
01:08:07,508 --> 01:08:09,310
Looks like this is where we end, Sheen.

779
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,685
You'll come back.

780
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,437
Interesting!

781
01:08:13,948 --> 01:08:15,016
Bad luck!

782
01:08:15,964 --> 01:08:17,365
Maybe next time.

783
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,254
Hey, what are you looking at?

784
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,279
Kiss me.

785
01:08:31,246 --> 01:08:32,790
Am I dreaming?

786
01:08:33,248 --> 01:08:34,248
Hey!

787
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:45,794

Hello Araneta!

860
01:12:45,477 --> 01:12:48,480
What's up Vivarkada?

861
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:50,776
Wow!

862
01:12:50,801 --> 01:12:51,931
Before anything else.

863
01:12:51,956 --> 01:12:55,818
Thank you Sugar and Spice
for joining our prod.

864
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:58,012
We are Team SDP.

865
01:12:58,077 --> 01:13:03,215
Thank you so much for the warm welcome to
Seducing Drake Palma!

866
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:04,670
Yeah!

867
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:14,801
Seducing Drake Palma is authored by
Ariesa Domingo also known as Beeyotch!

868
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:16,223
Hello!

869
01:13:16,248 --> 01:13:17,482
She's here now.

870
01:13:17,507 --> 01:13:18,922
So let's say hello!

871
01:13:18,947 --> 01:13:22,143
Miss Ariesa in the crowd!

872
01:13:22,168 --> 01:13:29,069
The director of Seducing Drake Palma.
Let's give it up for Direk Crisanto Aquino!

873
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:30,204
Hello, Direk!

Direk, thank you so much!

875
01:13:31,555 --> 01:13:33,180
Hello, Direk!

876
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:34,907
Okay, I have a question.

877
01:13:35,587 --> 01:13:38,690
Who is Team Drake and Alys?

878
01:13:40,485 --> 01:13:42,187
I can’t hear you!

879
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:48,667
And who is Team Alys and Drake?

880
01:13:53,218 --> 01:13:56,521
Guys, you don't have to choose.

881
01:13:57,388 --> 01:14:00,158
Because we will give you both.

882
01:14:02,214 --> 01:14:10,397

Angela Muji, and our Drake Palma!

That's how it is!

928
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:25,308
We need to be super G for
our beloved supporters, right?

929
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:30,008
But you know, I also know
someone who’s super G.

930
01:17:30,033 --> 01:17:34,055
When it comes to being comes to
being flexible just to keep up with Gen Z.

931
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,665
And I'm talking about Kik Mobile.

932
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:42,462
We, Gen Z, want to be in control of
everything, even our data plans, texts,

933
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:45,302
calls, and even choosing our mobile number.

934
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:51,249
That's why there's KiQ Mobile, the
first very customizable telco made for us.

935
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:55,674
Pick what you need, top up anytime,
and get smart network priority.

936
01:17:55,699 --> 01:17:58,649
Just download the KiQ app,
set up your eSIM instantly,

937
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,784
no QR code needed, and you're good.

938
01:18:00,953 --> 01:18:04,302
And one more thing, your eSIM
is free when you get a data plan.

939
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:07,665
It's just a limited time,
so get the KiQ app now.

940
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,429
KiQ, our way, our rules.

941
01:18:10,454 --> 01:18:11,689
Thank you, KiQ Mobile.

942
01:18:11,714 --> 01:18:13,315
And thank you, Dylan!

943
01:18:13,479 --> 01:18:18,566
Again, many, many thanks to Yumi,
Frost, Rafa, Ethan, and Sara.

944
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,193
Thank you very much!

945
01:18:20,766 --> 01:18:24,069
And at this point, we would like
to acknowledge the presence.

946
01:18:24,094 --> 01:18:27,931
It's an honor that you're
here with us tonight.

947
01:18:28,035 --> 01:18:31,407

Signal, and of course, TV5.

Do you see that, Rabin?

It’s really happening, let's go!

Let's go!

1013
01:23:37,802 --> 01:23:39,637
I love you guys, thank you

Our very own Drake Palma, Rabin Angeles.

1015
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:51,417
Thank you so much, Rabin Angeles.

1016
01:23:51,442 --> 01:23:54,512
Wow, we can really feel that!

1017
01:23:54,537 --> 01:23:58,274
But Big Dome, do you want more?

1018
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:05,810
Of course! If you want more,
we’ve prepared a lot more for all of you.

1019
01:24:05,835 --> 01:24:09,639
This is just the start. There’s still so
much that can happen on this stage.

1020
01:24:09,664 --> 01:24:12,070
You’ve seen Rabin right now,

Wow, Rabin really looks different.

1025
01:24:21,544 --> 01:24:25,548
I like his suit, his costume for today,

1026
01:24:25,573 --> 01:24:28,013
but it would look even better
with someone by his side, right?

1027
01:24:31,048 --> 01:24:32,983
Who? Who?

1028
01:24:34,499 --> 01:24:35,567

01:39:34,217 --> 01:39:37,821
But before I introduce them,
may I request

1208
01:39:38,488 --> 01:39:43,560
Araneta Coliseum to turn on
your phone flashlight.

1209
01:39:43,585 --> 01:39:44,604
Can you do it, guys, for me?

1210
01:39:44,629 --> 01:39:45,637
Come on.

1211
01:39:45,662 --> 01:39:49,700

Wow, you even have a rose there.

This is for you!

1265
01:45:44,938 --> 01:45:47,298
- Thank you, Cj.
- No need to ask where or who it came from.

1266
01:45:49,859 --> 01:45:51,094
- From you!
- I didn’t even say anything.

1267
01:45:51,094 --> 01:45:53,029
It’s from you,
you’re the one who gave it to me

1268
01:45:53,029 --> 01:45:54,898
Of course,
we appreciate what you did.

1269
01:45:54,898 --> 01:45:56,166
But that’s heavy, huh.

1270
01:45:56,166 --> 01:45:58,668
- Yeah, that’s true.
- As heavy as my love for you,

1271
01:45:59,035 --> 01:46:01,871
of the people, here in Araneta.

1272
01:46:01,871 --> 01:46:02,871
- But...
- Yes!

1273
01:46:03,073 --> 01:46:05,775
That was a very wonderful performance.
I mean, I’m so proud of you!

1274
01:46:05,775 --> 01:46:08,244
You deserved this entire Coliseum,
Ashtine.

1275
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:09,446
Thank you!

1276
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:11,247
From Viva Cafe, to here.

1277
01:46:11,272 --> 01:46:13,408
- Yes.
- Wow, you are so talented.

1278
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:16,786
But you know, you’re blessed too,
Ashtine because,

1279
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:18,697
I heard, Ash…

1280
01:46:18,722 --> 01:46:21,191
I only heard some news
that I came across.

1281
01:46:21,491 --> 01:46:26,696
They say you’re the
newest ambassador of White Rose.

1282
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:31,895
Look at them,
they are super happy.

1283
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,003
Is that true?

1284
01:46:33,036 --> 01:46:36,840
- Yes, it’s true.
- Congratulations!

1285
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:37,841
Yes!

1286
01:46:37,841 --> 01:46:39,342
Amen, amen...

1287
01:46:39,342 --> 01:46:41,711
You deserve it, Ashtine.
That’s who you are, but…

1288
01:46:41,845 --> 01:46:45,115
What can you say now that you’re finally…

1289
01:46:45,115 --> 01:46:46,292
You want me to hold it for you?

1290
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:47,484
It’s okay, I’ve got this.

1291
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,185
You got that.
There’s nothing you can’t handle anyway.

1292
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:50,290
You two, really managed it.

1293
01:46:52,822 --> 01:46:55,592
What can you say, Ash?
That you are part

1294
01:46:55,617 --> 01:46:58,086
of a new family.
Of course, White Rose.

1295
01:46:58,111 --> 01:47:01,247
Of course, I’m super happy
for this another blessing.

1296
01:47:01,272 --> 01:47:02,640
Aside from that..

1297
01:47:02,907 --> 01:47:06,011
It’s so happy because
they welcomed me so warmly.

1298
01:47:06,036 --> 01:47:09,639
Like, I really felt welcomed,
and that’s what’s important.

1299
01:47:09,786 --> 01:47:10,786
Right?

1300
01:47:10,915 --> 01:47:12,684
Because, that’s the thing with you, Ash.

1301
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:15,779
Your energy,
no matter which room you enter.

1302
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:18,173
- Really?
- You illuminated instantly.

1303
01:47:18,248 --> 01:47:19,248
That’s your magic.

1304
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:20,417
- Thank you.
- Honestly.

1305
01:47:20,450 --> 01:47:21,584
- But...
- I’m not kidding.

1306
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:26,264
But, I just want to take this
opportunity to, to invite everyone

1307
01:47:26,289 --> 01:47:30,860

1308
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:31,895
Would that be alright?

1309
01:47:31,995 --> 01:47:33,096
Oh! I think I love that.

1310
01:47:33,096 --> 01:47:33,897

1360
01:49:43,538 --> 01:49:44,649
I'm a scholar.

1361
01:49:44,683 --> 01:49:46,657
I have never cheated in my life.

1362
01:49:46,682 --> 01:49:47,761
And I don't need to.

1363
01:49:47,786 --> 01:49:49,088
Are you really a good girl?

1364
01:49:49,113 --> 01:49:50,753
Or are you really deep inside a bad girl?

1365
01:49:50,803 --> 01:49:54,918
You believed in me
even when others didn't.

1366
01:49:55,094 --> 01:50:00,507
If the school is cheating us,
we fight back.

1367
01:50:00,532 --> 01:50:04,812
This is really one of the best
Pinoy series that we can watch.

1368
01:50:04,837 --> 01:50:09,441

Good evening, Araneta!

1416
01:54:49,274 --> 01:54:54,868
There it is, Tash, it's been a month since
our viewers watched Bad Genius, the series.

1417
01:54:54,893 --> 01:54:57,596
Of course, this is
directed by Derick Cabrido.

1418
01:54:57,596 --> 01:55:01,433
So, how excited are you
in the upcoming episodes?

1419
01:55:01,458 --> 01:55:04,928
Are there any surprises
that we should look forward to?

1420
01:55:05,003 --> 01:55:07,005
Yes, many, many surprises.

1421
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:10,133
And I'm super, super excited
for all of you guys to see it.

1422
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:16,374
So, please look forward to Bad Genius,

01:55:34,911 --> 01:55:35,911
One million.

1430
01:55:35,936 --> 01:55:37,705
So, P250K each, right?

1431
01:55:37,876 --> 01:55:38,897

Get him!

1531
02:01:55,049 --> 02:01:56,049
Hey, Keifer!

1532
02:01:59,046 --> 02:02:03,651
Fans rushed to book tickets for
Ang Mutya ng Section E Stars.

1533
02:02:03,811 --> 02:02:06,747
The crowd gets restless
while waiting for the stars.

1534
02:02:06,772 --> 02:02:11,995
It was just launched this January, but it
already has so many international fans.

1535
02:02:22,150 --> 02:02:23,718

Woah..

1580
02:05:47,754 --> 02:05:50,378
Good evening, Araneta Coliseum!

1581
02:05:53,373 --> 02:05:56,843
It’s so great to
reunite with all of you.

1582
02:05:56,868 --> 02:06:01,682
It was only two months ago
that we were together at NFT!

1583
02:06:01,707 --> 02:06:03,442
Yes, it’s great!

1584
02:06:03,467 --> 02:06:04,769
Your support is amazing.

1585
02:06:04,794 --> 02:06:08,898
We just want to say
we truly feel your support

1586
02:06:08,942 --> 02:06:11,411
even though the series
has been over for months.

1587
02:06:11,411 --> 02:06:13,880
You’re still here,
from the beginning until now.

1588
02:06:13,905 --> 02:06:15,924
Thank you so much.

1589
02:06:15,949 --> 02:06:20,374
And of course,
thank you so much to Team AMNSE.

1590
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:22,888
Give them a round of applause.

1591
02:06:22,913 --> 02:06:29,037
Yes, Miss Lara Flores a.k.a.
Eat More To Be Happy is watching tonight.

1592
02:06:29,062 --> 02:06:30,297
Hello, Lara.

1593
02:06:30,322 --> 02:06:31,423
Where are you?

1594
02:06:31,601 --> 02:06:32,598
Lara!

1595
02:06:32,623 --> 02:06:33,623
Lara?

1596
02:06:34,895 --> 02:06:37,712
She is the author of
Ang Mutya ng Section E.

1597
02:06:37,737 --> 02:06:42,776
And of course, big thanks also
to our director, Direk Ted Boborol.

1598
02:06:45,171 --> 02:06:48,741
And because of your
overwhelming support,

1599
02:06:57,791 --> 02:07:01,628
we have a surprise for you guys.

1600
02:07:07,834 --> 02:07:08,834
First up,

1601
02:07:09,762 --> 02:07:16,769
you will be able to watch
Book Two of Ang Mutya ng Section E!

1602
02:07:24,053 --> 02:07:25,053
But,

1603
02:07:25,388 --> 02:07:26,388
hold on.

1604
02:07:26,813 --> 02:07:33,320
But the question is,
who is going to join us for Book Two?

1605
02:07:36,256 --> 02:07:40,694
Vivarkada, let's watch this!

1606
02:07:58,979 --> 02:07:59,979
They say,

1607
02:08:00,514 --> 02:08:01,815
you’re worthless,

1608
02:08:02,482 --> 02:08:03,550
no one accepts.

1609
02:08:05,686 --> 02:08:09,556
Maybe that's why it was so hard
for you to accept me in the beginning.

1610
02:08:14,361 --> 02:08:16,830
But you accepted me wholeheartedly.

1611
02:08:22,803 --> 02:08:24,471
Because I’m one of you.

1612
02:08:28,408 --> 02:08:30,110
Do you want to put your picture here?

1613
02:08:31,018 --> 02:08:33,138
- Me?
- You're Section E.

1614
02:08:33,914 --> 02:08:34,948
I'm Section E.

1615
02:08:43,824 --> 02:08:48,486
It was so easy for me to hurt JJ,
to make her fall in love with me,

1616
02:08:48,528 --> 02:08:49,846
just to hurt her.

1617
02:08:54,501 --> 02:08:55,802
Why didn't you tell me?

1618
02:08:55,827 --> 02:08:58,163
Why did I only find out here?

1619
02:09:21,128 --> 02:09:22,963
Do not disrespect me.

1620
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:25,098
You might forget who I am.

1621
02:09:30,256 --> 02:09:31,391
Mom is here.

1622
02:09:31,851 --> 02:09:33,619
She won't hurt you anymore.

1623
02:09:33,953 --> 02:09:36,089
Revenge is not the answer.

1624
02:09:38,844 --> 02:09:42,281
Sir, why didn't you let
me finish that woman?

1625
02:09:48,607 --> 02:09:49,808
Revenge is for the weak.

1626
02:09:50,329 --> 02:09:53,332
And I'm not a weakling like
Keifer to do what he did.

1627
02:09:59,345 --> 02:10:01,505
I'm not trying to force you
to like me as your father.

1628
02:10:01,668 --> 02:10:04,531
But please, learn the word respect.

1629
02:10:10,430 --> 02:10:14,934
What I want is Keifer, Yuri,
and their gang.

1630
02:10:16,022 --> 02:10:17,724
You're going to die.

1631
02:10:19,305 --> 02:10:20,305
Shut up!

1632
02:10:25,557 --> 02:10:27,364
It's hard for me to find my family.

1633
02:10:28,054 --> 02:10:29,110
I'm one of a kind.

1634
02:10:41,615 --> 02:10:42,616
One day,

1635
02:10:43,883 --> 02:10:46,619
you'll realize why I did all of this.

1636
02:10:50,356 --> 02:10:52,091
I'll hurt her too.

1637
02:10:52,686 --> 02:10:53,686
Really.

1638
02:10:54,205 --> 02:10:58,083

my father scarred us.

02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:17,555
Are you getting paid for this?

1701
02:20:18,563 --> 02:20:21,566
And does this count as an
extra-curricular activity?

1702
02:20:23,984 --> 02:20:26,653
I'm really into plants, especially flowers.

1703
02:20:31,558 --> 02:20:32,558
Here,

1704
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:35,028
a flower, for you.

1705
02:20:57,951 --> 02:21:00,020
You don't need to give me flowers.

1706
02:21:00,621 --> 02:21:01,889
To be honest,

1707
02:21:01,889 --> 02:21:02,956
It's kind of gross.

1708
02:21:02,956 --> 02:21:04,112
Gross?

1709
02:21:04,691 --> 02:21:06,026
What's gross about that?

1710
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:09,254
We agreed we'd just keep
things chill, so why?

1711
02:21:09,563 --> 02:21:10,631

the official soundtrack of our
first ever movie with Andres.

02:25:33,981 --> 02:25:40,534
“MINAMAHAL” written and directed by
the one and only Jason Paul Laxamana.

1745
02:25:41,188 --> 02:25:47,189
From series to big screen, guys! Thank
you so much for your love and support,

1746
02:25:47,214 --> 02:25:49,684
this is all because of you!

1747
02:25:49,769 --> 02:25:51,971
Yes, and wait.

1748
02:25:52,438 --> 02:25:55,274
I just have one last message,
it’s just quick.

1749
02:25:55,374 --> 02:25:56,374
What is it?

1750
02:25:56,850 --> 02:25:58,736
There you go again!

1751
02:26:04,717 --> 02:26:05,717
Firstly,

1752
02:26:05,951 --> 02:26:09,054
I would like to thank you
each and everyone that is here today.

1753
02:26:09,522 --> 02:26:13,826
Guys, really, you really,
you touch our hearts really.

1754
02:26:13,826 --> 02:26:17,596
Everyone here in the Viva family,
we are so grateful

1755
02:26:17,596 --> 02:26:19,198
for each and every one of you.

1756
02:26:19,198 --> 02:26:23,502
You know, we know that you guys,
some of you traveled a long distance to get

1757
02:26:23,502 --> 02:26:24,502
here today.

1758
02:26:25,137 --> 02:26:27,306
We know and we really appreciate that.

1759
02:26:27,306 --> 02:26:31,827
And for all the fan projects that you
guys do for us, thank you so much.

1760
02:26:32,845 --> 02:26:36,282
Your unwavering support is really
truly cherished by us.

1761
02:26:36,882 --> 02:26:38,117
And secondly,

1762
02:26:38,884 --> 02:26:43,189
to our Viva family, Boss Vic
and the Del Rosario family,

1763
02:26:43,214 --> 02:26:49,228
Boss Vincent, Boss Val, Boss Veronique,
and Tita June, thank you so much.

1764
02:26:49,261 --> 02:26:53,899
Because if it wasn't for you guys,
we would not be here on this stage today.

1765
02:26:53,924 --> 02:26:54,942
Right, Ash?

1766
02:26:54,967 --> 02:26:56,142
Yes, that's right.

1767
02:26:56,167 --> 02:27:00,873
And we really appreciate that no matter
who's here on stage,

1768
02:27:00,898 --> 02:27:02,811
you guys are really cheering.

1769
02:27:02,836 --> 02:27:04,970
So thank you so much.

1770
02:27:05,832 --> 02:27:06,832
And,

1771
02:27:09,001 --> 02:27:10,906
And lastly...

1772
02:27:21,994 --> 02:27:23,760
Ashtine Olviga,

1773
02:27:27,859 --> 02:27:30,634
I'm really, really, really proud of you.

1774
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:32,028
You see this?

1775
02:27:33,829 --> 02:27:34,882
You're amazing, you know.

1776
02:27:34,907 --> 02:27:39,479
Ash, I truly want to say that I
truly appreciate you, you know.

1777
02:27:39,504 --> 02:27:41,837
And starting my journey,

1778
02:27:42,169 --> 02:27:45,881
you know, I wouldn't have wished
to do this with anyone else.

1779
02:27:49,889 --> 02:27:54,760
You are not only a blessing to my life,
but a blessing to many others here today.

1780
02:27:59,999 --> 02:28:02,768
So with that being said, thank you.

1781
02:28:04,703 --> 02:28:07,973
- Were you surprised?
- Yes, I'm speechless.

1782
02:28:07,973 --> 02:28:11,043
I don't know what to say.
But I'm really proud of you too.

1783
02:28:11,043 --> 02:28:15,114
And I'm also really happy
that you're here with me today.

1784
02:28:31,330 --> 02:28:33,299
Wow, that’s intense!

1785
02:28:35,701 --> 02:28:36,769
You're here!

1786
02:28:36,835 --> 02:28:39,635
I think my twin is feeling giddy.

1787
02:28:40,859 --> 02:28:42,694
Atasha Muhlach, everybody!

1788
02:28:42,741 --> 02:28:43,741
Guys!

1789
02:28:48,013 --> 02:28:50,849
Wow, this is so thrilling.

1790
02:28:51,283 --> 02:28:52,793
Let me see, let me see.

1791
02:28:52,818 --> 02:28:54,162
Let me see,
how does that giddiness look?

1792
02:28:54,186 --> 02:28:55,587
Wow, it's so giddy.

1793
02:28:55,587 --> 02:28:56,655
But here it is, guys.

1794
02:28:56,922 --> 02:29:03,295
Please give it up for
Ashtine Olviga and Andres Muhlach!

1795
02:29:04,674 --> 02:29:08,242
Wow, guys! Congratulations
on your new movie, guys!

1796
02:29:08,267 --> 02:29:13,194
I'm sure everybody's super
giddy and excited, right?

1797
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:20,312
Yes, but as they say, all things
come to an end, even our bonding.

1798
02:29:20,827 --> 02:29:23,231
Aww, but of course,

1799
02:29:23,256 --> 02:29:27,504
before we end this night, we
would like to thank again the whole

1800

Yes, to our bosses, thank you so much.

1806
02:29:44,269 --> 02:29:47,239
We wouldn't be here
if not because of you.

02:29:47,264 --> 02:29:52,937
To Boss Vic, Boss Vincent,
Boss Veronique, Boss Val, and Boss Verb.

1808

We love you, we love you.

Avenues of the Diamond was just released,

1832
02:31:53,910 --> 02:32:00,547
we didn’t expect it, but it went viral
because of you, Vivarkada fans.

1833
02:32:00,572 --> 02:32:02,354
Thank you so much!

1834

And if you think we're done,
can we do that?

1867
02:34:16,393 --> 02:34:17,537
Of course!

1868
02:34:17,562 --> 02:34:20,904
More to come this 2026.

1869
02:34:21,297 --> 02:34:24,450
The best-selling novel by Yana Loves You.

1870
02:34:24,639 --> 02:34:27,667
My Husband is a Mafia Boss.

1871
02:34:28,131 --> 02:34:32,804
And the killer in the horror story
by Knight in Black.

1872
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:35,952
Hell University.

1873
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:37,742
Greater things are coming.

1874
02:34:37,767 --> 02:34:40,152
Bigger stories will unfold.

1875
02:34:40,177 --> 02:34:44,080
That's why, the fun continues.

1876
02:34:44,105 --> 02:34:49,367
No matter where in the world,
you're with Vivarkada.

1877
02:34:49,392 --> 02:34:52,260
Only here at Viva One.

1878
02:35:06,547 --> 02:35:08,084
Fan service!

1879
02:35:08,281 --> 02:35:09,516
Fan service!

1880
02:35:09,650 --> 02:35:11,151
Super excited!

1881
02:35:11,198 --> 02:35:12,862
So excited!

1882
02:35:12,886 --> 02:35:15,770
Super excited!

1883
02:35:18,327 --> 02:35:20,427
Let's go, Vivarkada!

1884
02:35:20,452 --> 02:35:21,452
SDP!

1885
02:35:21,477 --> 02:35:24,287
We’re excited to see Viva One!

1886
02:35:24,312 --> 02:35:26,840
Vivarkada!

1887
02:35:27,394 --> 02:35:31,101
We’re here to support
Atasha Mulach!

1888
02:35:31,126 --> 02:35:33,959
I just want to say thank you
so much to all of you.

1889
02:35:33,984 --> 02:35:36,009
We do this only for you guys.

1890
02:35:36,009 --> 02:35:39,646
And we're so, so happy to make you guys
smile or to even just make your days.

1891
02:35:39,671 --> 02:35:43,894
She's giving the same energy
that her fans are giving for her.

1892
02:35:43,919 --> 02:35:46,899
Let's go, Heaven!

1893
02:35:46,924 --> 02:35:50,766
Of course, we won't succeed
without them.

1894
02:35:50,961 --> 02:35:54,264
This concert is for them.

1895
02:35:54,289 --> 02:35:56,701
This is our way of saying thank you.

1896
02:35:56,726 --> 02:35:58,365
We appreciate you.

1897
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:03,170
And we'll do our best to make you happy
and to make your night, right?

1898
02:36:03,195 --> 02:36:04,571
We love you, Heaven!

1899
02:36:04,596 --> 02:36:06,757
We're so proud of you!

1900
02:36:08,242 --> 02:36:09,907
Let's go, Rabin!

1901
02:36:10,504 --> 02:36:14,141
If you don't support us,
we can't achieve what we have now.

1902
02:36:14,166 --> 02:36:17,359
If you don't support us,
we won’t have the strength to do this.

1903
02:36:17,384 --> 02:36:18,552
In front of many people.

1904
02:36:18,577 --> 02:36:20,988
So thank you so much to all of you.

1905
02:36:21,013 --> 02:36:22,625
Let's go, brother Rabin!

1906
02:36:22,650 --> 02:36:24,419
I went to see Rabin!

1907
02:36:24,564 --> 02:36:25,164
From

1908
02:36:25,189 --> 02:36:26,305
Quirino!

1909
02:36:26,387 --> 02:36:31,332
Even if I work hard, if you're not here,
I wouldn't be here either.

1910
02:36:32,499 --> 02:36:34,042
Let's go, Dylan!

1911
02:36:34,067 --> 02:36:37,871
I'm very thankful to everyone who
supported, to everyone who believes in my

1912
02:36:37,871 --> 02:36:40,520
character, in my role, in my work
in Seducing Drake Palma.

1913
02:36:40,545 --> 02:36:45,135
And I'm just excited to be sharing
more episodes with you guys.

1914
02:36:46,013 --> 02:36:50,850
They're one of my biggest motivators
when it comes to this industry

1915
02:36:50,875 --> 02:36:52,189
and doing this art.

1916
02:36:52,378 --> 02:36:54,914
Thank you guys for all of
the love and the support.

1917
02:36:57,408 --> 02:36:58,609
We’re even from Surigao.

1918
02:36:58,634 --> 02:37:01,770
That's what we're aiming for,
to see HyGab.

1919
02:37:01,795 --> 02:37:03,288
- We're from Davao.
- Yes.

1920
02:37:03,313 --> 02:37:05,851
Representing AshDres Mindanao.

1921
02:37:05,876 --> 02:37:07,578
I'm from Taiwan.

1922
02:37:07,603 --> 02:37:09,689
Then I'm on vacation in Zamboanga.

1923
02:37:09,714 --> 02:37:11,691
My flight was a while ago.

1924
02:37:11,716 --> 02:37:13,292
Then I came straight here.

1925
02:37:13,317 --> 02:37:15,128
Of course, we wouldn't be here
without the fans.

1926
02:37:15,152 --> 02:37:16,754
They're the ones who support us.

1927
02:37:16,754 --> 02:37:18,486
And I'm just really, really grateful.

1928
02:37:18,511 --> 02:37:23,647
There wouldn't be other adaptations
if it wasn't for the fans' support.

1929
02:37:24,168 --> 02:37:27,204
We are here to support KrisshRome!

1930
02:37:28,032 --> 02:37:30,568
We love you Jerome!

1931
02:37:32,503 --> 02:37:37,041
They're the ones who put
in the effort to showcase our scenes.

1932
02:37:37,066 --> 02:37:39,969
They're there to support all of our events.

1933
02:37:43,801 --> 02:37:44,835
Let's go, Aubrey!

1934
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:46,262
I'm so proud of you!

1935
02:37:46,287 --> 02:37:49,823
An artist wouldn't make it
without the support of the fans.

1936
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:56,226
They're such a big help in reaching
my dreams wherever I am right now.

1937
02:37:56,420 --> 02:37:57,889
Thank you so much.

1938
02:38:00,998 --> 02:38:02,166
We are MarVen!

1939
02:38:02,191 --> 02:38:02,905
MarVen!

1940
02:38:02,930 --> 02:38:04,467
MarVen!

1941
02:38:04,595 --> 02:38:09,290
I can only promise to all the fans who've
been supporting me since day one that

1942
02:38:09,315 --> 02:38:11,057
I will get better every day.

1943
02:38:11,275 --> 02:38:15,056
So, for all the upcoming projects,
I will always do my best.

1944
02:38:15,081 --> 02:38:17,890
I'm really looking forward to AshDres,

1945
02:38:17,915 --> 02:38:19,517
But all of the cast are so great.

1946
02:38:19,542 --> 02:38:22,530
I'm excited to see them even though
we're on the outside team.

1947
02:38:22,555 --> 02:38:23,556
It's my first time.

1948
02:38:23,581 --> 02:38:27,813
And I'm looking forward to AshDres,
of course, and to everyone who put in the

1949
02:38:27,838 --> 02:38:29,940
effort for this Vivarkada concert.

1950
02:38:31,004 --> 02:38:33,669
AshDres, I'm so proud of you!

1951
02:38:33,731 --> 02:38:36,367
Why is it fun to be an AshDres fan?

1952
02:38:36,392 --> 02:38:37,727
Because it relieves stress.

1953
02:38:37,752 --> 02:38:39,820
We know that they'll appreciate it.

1954
02:38:39,845 --> 02:38:41,847
So, we're really excited.

1955
02:38:41,872 --> 02:38:44,675
Let's go, AshDres!

1956
02:38:45,710 --> 02:38:48,488
They've been supporting us
from day one until now.

1957
02:38:48,513 --> 02:38:49,513
We wouldn't be here
if not for them.

1958
02:38:49,548 --> 02:38:50,415
So, thank you.

1959
02:38:50,448 --> 02:38:54,251
It's fun to be a part of Vivarkada
because of AshDres!

1960
02:38:55,894 --> 02:38:57,220
Let's go, AshDres!

1961
02:38:57,245 --> 02:38:58,860
AshDre!

1962
02:38:58,898 --> 02:39:04,937
I know a lot of you even traveled from
far places and even set up a lot of fan

1963
02:39:04,962 --> 02:39:07,555
projects for all of us,
all of us Viva artists.

1964
02:39:07,612 --> 02:39:12,150
Just know that we always try to do
our best for each and every one of you that

1965
02:39:12,175 --> 02:39:14,165
is watching and supporting us.

1966
02:39:14,439 --> 02:39:16,883
Vivarkada!

1967
02:39:16,908 --> 02:39:19,738
Once you watch their shows,
you feel like you're one of them.

1968
02:39:19,763 --> 02:39:22,255
Vivarkada!

1969
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:23,348
