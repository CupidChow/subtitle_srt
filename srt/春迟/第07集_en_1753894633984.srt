1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
Lan longest

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The End

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you going to be a driver for Miss Zhao today?

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You weren't like this two days ago.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You turned around so fast.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's just these few days. I found that we weren't suitable.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why not? I think we're quite suitable.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you want to know how your father died?

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How did my father die?

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was my adoptive father who let A Chi shoot.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because A Chi's father was killed by your father.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Impossible.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you don't believe me, you can ask A Chi yourself.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, Zhou Chi and I...

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You can only choose me.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I told you.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I won't choose either of you.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm getting out of the car.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You two are the same.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You two are the same.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you doing, Mr. Gu?

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Stop!

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Stop!

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you crazy, Mr. Gu?

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where are you going? Stop!

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Where are you going? Stop!

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mr. Gu, did you hear me? Stop!

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mr. Gu, don't drive any further!

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We're almost at the top of the mountain.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mr. Gu, calm down.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Drive down.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There's a cliff down there.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You don't want to die?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Of course I want to die. But I want you more now.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mr. Gu, stop! Stop!

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Stop!

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mr. Gu, you're crazy!

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm telling you.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't take back the marriage contract.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I won't fall in love with you.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you love Zhou Chi?

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes, I love him.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's much cuter than you.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why did you send me candy when you don't love me?

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why did you go to the hotel with me?

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've been using you and taking revenge on you.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Can't you see that?

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Zhao Chong Men,

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
no woman can humiliate me.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You and I are the same kind.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In order to achieve our goal, we can do everything we can.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Only I'm the best match for you.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes, we are the same kind.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're crazy. I'm crazy too.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But please don't be too self-conceited.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What about Zhou Chi?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's the one who shot your father.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can choose him or not.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's none of your business.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can't be with you.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then I'll let you die.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll let you go.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. Gu.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Gu Shizhen.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It was my father who shot Chi.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because his father was killed by your father.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Is it really like what Gu Shizhen said?

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Was Zhou Chi's father killed by my father?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Then why did he save me in the hotel?

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Manman, why are you sitting on the floor?

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Get up. It's cold on the floor.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Mom, did your father kill someone named Zhou Kun?

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That was a few years ago.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
One day, your father went out to do his work.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Sir, please wipe your shoes.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have something to do today. I won't wipe them.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Sir, wipe them.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Manman, get up.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I have something to do today. I won't wipe them.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Take the money and wipe them next time.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you, sir.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How much did you earn today? Give it to me.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Dad!

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is for mom.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Your mom won't die. Your dad and I are going to die.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Dad, give me a pack of eye drops.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Dad, give me a pack of eye drops.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Dad, give me a pack of eye drops.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Give it to me.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Give me the eye drops.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm telling you, this thing can kill people and make them die.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Give it to me.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Listen to me.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm Zhao Qingzhai. I can use important methods to help you find a way to borrow it.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Find time to come to the Qingzhai Pharmacy to find me.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I beg you to give me back the eye drops.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Give them back to me. I beg you.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He didn't go to your father.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Two days later, he died of a stroke.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
His wife died of illness because she didn't have money to buy medicine.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was easy for someone like Zhou Kun to die.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Poor his wife.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She didn't have a good day with him.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, Zhou Chi, did you kill my father because of this?

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now Zhou Yi Sen is injured.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's hard to get close to him for now.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Although I haven't completely solved the crisis,

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm still alive.

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Does it mean that the situation has changed?

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Miss, do you need a watch?

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Master, do you think time can be reversed?

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If time can be reversed, then everything will start over.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Miss, if time can be reversed,

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
would you like to try again?

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, because there are too many misfortunes.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But if it happens, I can only accept it.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And change all the misfortunes.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What if changing these misfortunes is a huge cost?

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Miss, this watch is not ready.

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Take it back and make a memorial.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes, Miss.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Miss, do you want to wipe your shoes?

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No, thanks.

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Just one?

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How about this? I'll pay you.

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I won't wipe my shoes.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you, Miss.

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,040
Recently, a group of people are trying to suppress the

129
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,000
Wei organization.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We need to transfer the list as soon as possible.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yisen Public Hall has a code book of the list.

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You are the most likely person to get close to it.

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Zhou Chi, I also want to have nothing to do with you.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But I have to continue to use you.

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Dad is gone.

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I have to complete the unfinished task for him.

137
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Maybe this task can help me get rid of all the troubles.

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Kill Zhou Yisen.

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Zhao Chunman, are you really just trying to use him?

140
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I won't choose either of you.

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Because I don't love anyone.

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Why is no one betting with you?

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What about me?

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Zhao Chunman, can you stop bothering me?

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Are you going to bet or not?

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What are you betting on?

148
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Shake your head and guess the numbers.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If I win, you have to promise me one condition.

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If I lose, I will not appear in front of you from now on.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will not appear in front of you from now on.

152
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I guess three sixes.

153
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I guess three sixes.

154
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Zhao Chunman, you know I won't let you lose.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,960
The hole in the

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Watch out!

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Who is it? Who is it? Catch him!

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You have always kept your promise.

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The wind is silent.

160
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He runs towards the sky.

161
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The wind is silent, but the smoke is not strong.

162
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He turns around and leaves.

163
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The doctor has already come.

164
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The wound on the shoulder is not a serious injury.

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He walks for half a lifetime, half a lifetime, but he is not used to it.

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He is with his old friend, but he is still touching his own face.

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Someone asked if he was...

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Who shot him?

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It should be the person who came to the casino to make trouble.

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why didn't you send him back?

171
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He didn't want to make aunt worry.

172
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He was afraid of being shot.

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He was afraid of being shot.

174
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He was afraid of being shot.

175
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He was afraid of being shot.

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He was afraid of being shot.

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He was afraid of being shot.

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He was afraid of being shot.

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He was afraid of being shot.

180
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He was afraid of being shot.

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He was afraid of being shot.
