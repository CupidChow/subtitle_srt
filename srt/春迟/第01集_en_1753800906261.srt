1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Zone 3

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,180
What about that one,

3
00:00:36,680 --> 00:01:02,980
where are we gonna do the

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I hate men who are not strong enough.

5
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,320
Sister-in-law,

6
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
I'm not strong enough.

7
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,320
You can try it yourself.

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Help me?

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Take off?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:55,620
I raised the

12
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
two men's blood and blood.

13
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,620
I don't like it down there.

14
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,620
In the last life,

15
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
they made me a broken man.

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,620
The chief manager.

17
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,620
Once again,

18
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,620
I'm not strong enough.

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Once again,

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,240
I just want to change everything.

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,240
And they are my last enemies.

22
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Gu Shizhen,

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
when are you going to marry Zhao Chunman?

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,240
You are so anxious to see your sister's joke.

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Her father just died.

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Just a joke.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Since you want it so much,

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
I can satisfy you.

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,240
I was going to avenge my father today.

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
But I met my best friend's fiancee

31
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
and we were fighting every night.

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I don't understand.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Who is it?

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Who are you?

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
What do you want?

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Zhou Chi.

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Gu Shizhen is my big brother.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Then you should call me sister-in-law.

39
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm not here to meddle with Gu Shizhen's business.

40
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Get out of the way.

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
If you want to pursue your father's death,

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I advise you to stop.

43
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Zhou Chi.

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
I didn't see you today.

45
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Don't meddle with my business.

46
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Remember to open the safe before shooting.

47
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
I'll be there.

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
What a kind heart.

49
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
The enemy of the killer is right in front of you.

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
No matter what the goal is,

51
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Zhou Chi,

52
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
I will let you live.

53
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
The lock is broken.

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Hurry.

55
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Hurry.

56
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Follow me.

57
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
You guys go over there.

58
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
OK.

59
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Over there.

60
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
OK.

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Go.

62
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Go.

63
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Who is in there?

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
It's me.

65
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Brother Chi.

66
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,860
The enemy is ready to shoot.

67
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
We are chasing the killer.

68
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,860
I see.

69
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
You go first. I'll be right there.

70
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
What are you waiting for?

71
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Follow me.

72
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Go.

73
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Brother Chi.

74
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
What's going on?

75
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Did you see the killer?

76
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
I just went to the wedding hall

77
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
and found my wife knocked out by him.

78
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
Yes.

79
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
I saw a woman jumping out of the window

80
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
when I was changing the wedding room.

81
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
Take her to a safe place first.

82
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
OK.

83
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
Brother Chi.

84
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
It's him.

85
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
He is the killer.

86
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Chi.

87
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
It's so funny.

88
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
He is the one who killed the victim.

89
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
I thought he would be my chance

90
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
to defend myself.

91
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
It turns out

92
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
he is my last chance to escape.

93
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
I just want to know

94
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Zhou Ying's death.

95
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
I don't know.

96
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
I just want to know

97
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
why Zhou Yisen killed my father.

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
If you are here to blame your father,

99
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
I advise you to stop.

100
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Father.

101
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Your father's death is very complicated.

102
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Your mother just said one more word.

103
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
I...

104
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Master,

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
please send a invitation to Zhou Yisen.

106
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Father.

107
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Where am I?

108
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Am I dead?

109
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
This is

110
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
my room.

111
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
30th of April.

112
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
The day my father was killed.

113
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
I was killed

114
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
by Zhou Chi in the west garden.

115
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Miss, you are awake.

116
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Master ordered a cake

117
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
at the west garden this morning.

118
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
He is celebrating your birthday tonight.

119
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
My father is still alive.

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Where is my father?

121
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
He is talking to his wife.

122
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
The medical team sent a invitation

123
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
to take Master to the doctor's room.

124
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Miss,

125
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
you haven't washed your face.

126
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Zhou Chi?

127
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Why is it him?

128
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
He was the one who tried to kill me in the last room.

129
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
But why did he shoot me

130
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
on the corridor?

131
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
I am also dead.

132
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
I am a fool.

133
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
The last room was the place where the dead were buried.

134
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
How did Zhou Chi turn into this time?

135
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
I don't know.

136
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I don't know.

137
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I don't know.

138
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I don't know.

139
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,180
icz

140
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,680
zery

141
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Zery

142
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
zery

143
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
zery

144
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,320
Go.

145
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Wait in the study with me.

146
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,120
Sit down.

147
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,400
I'll raise you.

148
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,480
My father is not well.

149
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
I'll go to the meeting for him.

150
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm sorry, Miss Zhao.

151
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,680
My father asked Boss Zhao to go there.

152
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,640
Miss Zhao?

153
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,800
I'm sorry, sister-in-law.

154
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,720
Call me Zhao Chunman.

155
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,280
Zhou Chi.

156
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,920
You know my name?

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,840
Let's go, little brother.

158
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll go with you.

159
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,800
No.

160
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Let's go.

161
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Wait.

162
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,760
Let me go with you.

163
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,840
Or you won't go back.

164
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,480
Manman.

165
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,920
Don't be ridiculous.

166
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
The last time in the last life.

167
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,600
The first time in this life.

168
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,880
Zhou Chi.

169
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,280
I still have to shoot you.

170
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,080
particularly

171
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,480
not

172
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,880
my mother and sister.

173
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,800
Please.

174
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,400
I beg your pardon, sister-in-law.

175
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,640
Miss Zhao.

176
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,160
Are you going

177
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
to get changed?

178
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:29,560
You?

179
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I want to keep an eye on you,

180
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
to prevent you from taking my father away.

181
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
No, thanks.

182
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
The wind blows gently,

183
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Who can see the end of the sky?

184
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Love and hate are both in pain.

185
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
The silent happiness

186
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,840
is telling you that we are real.

187
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,840
The smile is swallowed up.

188
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
The home at night,

189
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
the tears are flowing.

190
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
This time,

191
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
I must save my father's life.

192
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Look, the people in the mirror are not all the same.

193
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
The old heart can still

194
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,840
make you fall.

195
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
The wind blows gently,

196
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Who can see the end of the sky?

197
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Uncle

198
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Why did you bring her here?

199
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
I wanted to come myself.

200
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Uncle, please.

201
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Father,

202
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Father, I'll go up with you.

203
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Wait in the car.

204
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I promised to bring you here,

205
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
but I didn't promise to take you in.

206
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm sorry.

207
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Watch her.

208
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Sister-in-law, you can't get out of the car.

209
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
In the last life,

211
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
my father was born on the way home

212
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
after leaving the medical gang.

213
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
This time I'm with him.

214
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
The ending should change.

215
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
What happened?

216
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
What happened?

217
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840

246
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
What happened to him?

247
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
What happened?

248
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
