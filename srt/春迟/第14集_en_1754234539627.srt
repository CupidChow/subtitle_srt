1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,040
You.

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,040
I can't let fate decide.

4
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,040
As long as you don't go to the Western Courtyard of Yuchun,

5
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,040
everything may change.

6
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,040
I can protect you.

7
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
I will be back soon.

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Move these chairs here.

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Okay.

10
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Brother Chi.

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Is my father here?

12
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Not yet.

13
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Zhou Chi.

14
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
You wronged me

15
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
just to come and help the Yibang.

16
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
In the last life,

17
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Luo Yu and Gu Shichen

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,040
appeared in the dressing room.

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
No one came to hand in the list this time.

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
The dressing room.

21
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
The list is here.

22
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Why are you here?

23
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,040
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Nothing.

25
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Gu Shichen, let go of me.

26
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Let go of me.

27
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
What's the mission today?

28
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
What do you mean?

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Is the list in the Yuchun Theater?

30
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
I know you are part of the Qiangwei Organization.

31
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I also know

32
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
what your mission is.

33
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
But I killed Luo Yu

34
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
and he killed me.

35
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I don't know what you are doing.

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
But I killed Luo Yu

37
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
and I can't bear to hurt you.

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Why?

39
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Because I love you.

40
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Why can't you be with me?

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
If it was before,

42
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I would have been holding you back

43
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
and threaten you to be my woman.

44
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
But now,

45
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
I will treat you to be my woman.

46
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
You said I can't love.

47
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
I can learn.

48
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Isn't that enough?

49
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
You can't learn.

50
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
You can teach me.

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
As long as you teach me, I can do it.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Gu Shichen,

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
loving someone is a skill.

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
You don't have it.

55
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
You have it?

56
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Then you can love me.

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
You won't love anyone.

58
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
I used to like a woman.

59
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
I just wanted her body.

60
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
But I don't want your body.

61
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
I want your heart.

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
You want to kill Zhou Yisen, don't you?

63
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
I can do it.

64
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,040
But Zhou Chi can't.

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
He is too soft. He can't do it.

66
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
You can kill me if you kill Zhou Yisen.

67
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Let me go.

68
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Brother,

69
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
your father is here.

70
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Why is he still here?

71
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Yes, yes, yes.

72
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Not bad.

73
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
Watch the show with me.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
I don't want to see Zhou Yisen.

75
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Yifeng,

76
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
everything is ready.

77
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Come on.

78
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Chunman,

79
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
go back with me.

80
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
I can't come if you can.

81
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
You said you didn't do it for Yifeng.

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
You didn't even care about me.

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Why should I listen to you?

84
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
I'll explain to you when I get back.

85
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Chi, come here.

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Don't come here.

87
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,040
I just want to go to the wedding.

88
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Do you want to come with me?

89
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I want to go to the wedding.

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
What?

91
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Do you want to come with me?

92
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Oh, no.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
It seems to be back to the original place.

94
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Chi, come here.

95
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Coming.

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Come on.

97
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
What a good show.

98
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Someone shot Zhou Yisen again.

99
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Go to the second floor.

100
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Hurry.

101
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Hurry.

102
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Hurry.

103
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
This way.

104
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Hurry.

105
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Go.

106
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Go in every direction.

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
This way.

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
This way.

109
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Come with me.

110
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Hurry.

111
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
If you go further,

112
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
you will meet Yifeng.

113
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Last time,

114
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
he came up from this staircase.

115
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Zhou Chi, why did he stop?

116
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
The story is about to begin.

117
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
As long as we leave here safely,

118
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
it should be over.

119
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
If we leave here,

120
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
it will be all over.

121
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Leave here.

122
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Don't look back.

123
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
The situation of He Shan's family is back.

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Chi.

125
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Chi.

126
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Why do you have to come?

127
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Why?

128
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Because

129
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
I can't

130
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
see you die again.

131
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Die again?

132
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Die again.

133
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Die again.

134
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
This time,

135
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
it should be over.

136
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Zhou Chi.

137
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Zhou Chi.

138
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Zhou Chi.

139
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Zhou Chi.

140
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Zhou Chi.

141
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Zhou Chi.

142
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Zhou Chi.

143
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Zhou Chi.

144
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
I'm in the hospital.

145
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm not dead.

146
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Does it mean that the ending has changed?

147
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Don't move.

148
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
I'll give you a shot later.

149
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
You're awake.

150
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I didn't expect you to

151
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
ask me to die.

152
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
If I wanted you to die,

153
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
you wouldn't have the chance to kiss me.

154
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I should thank you for saying that.

155
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Chi.

156
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
I didn't expect you and my brother

157
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
to get into this situation

158
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
because of a woman.

159
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
The one who killed Zhou Yuxuan is not her.

160
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
I know.

161
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
So I killed A'wen.

162
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I promised to kill Zhou Yisen for her.

163
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Of course I would protect her.

164
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Gu Shizhen.

165
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
You're willing to die for her?

166
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm willing to die for her.

167
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm willing to die for her.

168
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm willing to die for her.

169
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm willing to die for her.

170
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm willing to die for her.

171
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Gu Shizhen.

172
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
You're always so hypocritical.

173
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
What are you doing?

174
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Let me go.

175
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Let me go.

176
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Let me go.

177
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Let me go.

178
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Let me go.

179
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Gu Shizhen, let go of me.

180
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I didn't hear her.

181
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Chi, how are you?

182
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Are you hurt badly?

183
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Chi, how are you?

184
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Are you hurt badly?

185
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Chi, how are you?

186
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Are you hurt badly?

187
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Aren't you embarrassed with me?

188
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Let me see the wounds.

189
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Manman, you should leave here first.

190
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I'll take care of Chi for you.

191
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Su Ran, why are you pulling the curtain?

192
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Let me see your wounds.

193
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I have something to tell the release squad.

194
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Your most important thing is to get healthy.

195
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Do you hear me?

196
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Your most important thing is to get healthy.

197
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Are you jealous?

199
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
They've known each other since they were kids.

200
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Zhou Chi has spent more time with her than you.

201
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
His feelings are more profound than yours.

202
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
The depth of the feelings is not measured by time.

203
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Zhou Chen Man!

204
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I saved your life too.

205
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
You treat me like this?

206
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Or I'll give you back your life.

207
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Gu Shizhen,

208
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
loving someone will not be done with these dirty tricks.

209
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Man Man, Chi has fallen asleep.

210
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Thank you for taking care of Chi for me.

211
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,920
I've already taken his things to your house.

212
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Why is Su Ruan's life so strange?

213
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
He really took everything.

214
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,920
But this doesn't seem like Zhou Chi's style of work.

215
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Eat.

217
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Why are you standing there?

218
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Zhou Chi, why did you have to come here?

219
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Because...

220
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,920
I can't see you die again.

221
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
See me die again?

222
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Is Zhou Chi like me?

223
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Does he have memories too?

224
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,920
The time is racing by

225
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,920
There is a flower on the roadside

226
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,920
It's the color of yesterday

227
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Who made a promise to whom?

228
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Who escaped from whom?

229
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,920
The whirlpool of time is confused

230
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:03,920
It's like you and me

231
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I'm in every moment

232
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Looking for your dream

233
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,920
But I can only chase

234
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,920
The wind of the next life
