00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,380
Congratulations

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,520
To the 8 broadly friendly brothers of Qingmu

5
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,640
To the good friends of Baihua

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can't believe you're not coming.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How can I?

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You asked for me.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Of course I should come.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We've said that we would witness each other's glorious moments.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Congratulations, Big Brother.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's stay for dinner.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll take care of it.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have to go.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't leave you alone.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't leave you alone.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't leave you alone.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
Stay for dinner.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,400
No.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,600
I'll go home.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,440
What?

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,840
You're in a rush to see Zhao Chun Man?

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,240
There's someone you must want to see.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Qiu Lingge?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Map of Plain Yugosờ

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
ivas.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,800
I want napalm.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,720
Do you want it?

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,600
No, thanks.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Come here.

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,280
Get my shoe.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,680
Th demonstration, please.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,520
lassen!

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,080
Ok?

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,080
Hurry up!

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,760
Let's go!

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,640
Go-go-go!

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm not a thief.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,160
Yes,

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,600
you're not.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
You think you're branches of an ordinary couple?

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm sorry. I didn't know...

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
It's easy to understand.

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
You have to be careful.

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
You shouldn't be too reckless.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Thank you.

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
You go to the hotel and clean your shoes.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
There are many rules there.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Take this money and buy a new pair of shoes.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Give me back my hat!

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Miss, he is a child.

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
He doesn't understand. No one teaches him.

53
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Don't argue with him.

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Give me back the money.

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Brother Qiu Lian!

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
This is my true identity.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I trust you.

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Take me home.

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I'll see them from afar.

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
I'll take you home.

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Brother Qiu Lian, we're almost there.

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Hold on.

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Brother Qiu Lian.

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Brother Qiu Lian.

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Don't touch it, Man Man.

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Mom.

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Give me more clothes.

70
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Too much.

71
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
My clothes smell like this.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Mom.

73
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Man Man.

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Where did you get this perfume?

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
It smells so good.

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
It's too big.

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
You two like to play with new things.

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Doctor!

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Doctor!

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Hurry up.

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Send her over there.

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
This is not Brother Qiu Lian.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
This is Mr. Yu.

84
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
The man who is the boss.

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Brother Qiu Lian has disappeared for so long.

86
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
How did he become like this?

87
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Congratulations.

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
You're in the hospital.

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I still have a long way to go.

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Zhao Qiu Lian, why can't I see the boss?

91
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
You've been talking about me.

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
You're doubting me.

93
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
You know I'm impatient.

94
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
So you let Zhou Chen come to meet me today.

95
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
If Zhao Chun Wan knew your current identity,

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I'm afraid she would be more shocked than Ah Chi.

97
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
She would hate you even more.

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
I didn't see the goods that the boss gave me last time.

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
I took the goods.

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Zhou Yi Sen is dead.

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Not only the goods,

102
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I can even give you the list.

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
But you have to take the goods.

104
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Look.

105
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Go wash your hands.

106
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Then we can eat.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Why is it you?

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Where is Zhao Chi?

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Why can't it be me?

110
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
You two made up pretty quickly.

111
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
When did we ever get together?

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
After my mom left,

113
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
I haven't eaten a woman's cooking for a long time.

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
You can do whatever you want.

115
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
After you finish eating, please leave.

116
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Sit down.

117
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Eat with me.

118
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
I don't eat with dogs.

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
What did you say?

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
I said, you are a dog.

121
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Do you still want to see Chi?

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Chi, I'm sorry.

123
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Chi, I'm sorry.

124
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Let go of me. I can walk on my own.

125
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Yi Yan, Zhou Zhi ran away.

126
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Brother Shi Zhen, I'll take the goods.

128
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
You're welcome, Mr. Yu Zi.

129
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Wait.

130
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Mr. Yu Zi's eyes are dirty.

131
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Wipe it.

132
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Thank you.

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Mr. Sen, the goods are ready.

134
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Who is it?

135
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Stop. You're not allowed to come in.

136
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Why are you here?

137
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
I couldn't wait for you to introduce yourself.

138
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
So I came here.

139
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Gu Shi Zhen,

140
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm here to see you.

141
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Gu, please sit down.

142
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm here to invite you to watch the opera.

143
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Yuchun Theater?

144
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I know.

145
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
The famous play Su Ruan.

146
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
What play?

147
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
The play that can get the list of the members of the Qiangwei organization.

148
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Mom.

149
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Mom, can you open the door?

150
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Mom, can you let me burn incense for dad?

151
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I don't have a traitor.

152
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Mom and dad don't have a traitor son.

153
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Mom.

154
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
You be your Mr. Yu Zi.

155
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Mom.

157
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Nan Cheng is in danger.

158
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
You and mom must be careful.

159
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Who is it?

160
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm Su Ruan.

161
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm here to watch the play.

162
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
If you want to hear the play, come to me.

163
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Okay. Miss, see you next time.

164
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
See you next time.

165
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Great!

166
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Great!

167
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
It's almost done.

168
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Ask...

169
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
What is love?

170
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
What is love?

171
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
What is love?

172
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
It's better not to meet.

173
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Why?

174
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm afraid that I'll make you dizzy.

175
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
What are you doing here?

176
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
We thought you were dead.

177
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Ruan, you're in danger now.

178
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Leave here.

179
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
I won't leave.

180
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
I'm a piece of armor.

181
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Nothing is more important than your life.

182
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Is this the reason why you and Gu Shizhen are in the same boat?

183
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I've died once.

184
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
I know it's more important to live first.

185
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
When you were little,

186
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
A Chi and I became you.

187
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Now I'm back.

188
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
So you don't have to continue.

189
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
This road is too dangerous.

190
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Maybe it was because of you before.

191
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
But now,

192
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
This is our own way.

193
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Ruan.

194
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Ruan.

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Ruan.

196
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
This is the last time we meet.

198
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
I'll see you again.

199
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
You should go.

200
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
I believe I won't be a human.

201
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Even if the fire in the heart

202
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
needs to be ignited by fuel,

203
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
we will never meet again.

204
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,240
When I walked through this moment,

205
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
the sun was shining.

206
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
When a flower on the roadside

207
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,240
was the color of yesterday.

208
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Who made a promise to whom?

209
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Who escaped from whom?

210
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,240
The whirlpool of time and space is confused.

211
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,240
It's like a puzzle.

212
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:43,240
I look for your eyes in every moment.

213
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:58,240
But I can only feel the wind of the future.
