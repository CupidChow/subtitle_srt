1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,040
Leng Zishou

2
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,840
Zhang Shuman

3
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,680
What do you want to say?

4
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,680
I didn't kill Uncle.

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,680
I didn't want to kill him

6
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,680
about Uncle's death.

7
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,680
It's Gu Shizhen.

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Gu Shizhen

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Do you remember the day we had our brother's death anniversary?

10
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Ten years ago, in this church,

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
we were the first to be married.

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Ah Chi, here!

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Isn't this the church?

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Why did you come here?

15
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Chinese worshipers go to temple of worship.

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Why did you come here?

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm afraid that the Chinese gods are too busy.

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
The foreign gods are more idle.

19
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
Can you count without the god's help?

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Just do what you want.

21
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
How can you really worship a god?

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
I, Gu Shizhen, I, Zhou Chi,

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
from today on, I will be your brother.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
From today on, I will be your brother.

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I will be your brother.

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
He will be your brother.

27
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
From now on,

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
I will eat and he will eat.

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
From now on,

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
we will share good fortune and suffer together.

31
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
We will never change.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
I will be your brother.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I will be your brother.

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I knew it.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
It's snowing heavily.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
The fish are frozen.

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I can't eat them.

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I feel like I'm going to freeze to death here.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Sorry, brother.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm a little bit scared.

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
It's okay.

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
As long as we are alive,

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
we will be able to change it one day.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Are you cold?

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I promise you.

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
One day,

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
we will have our own place.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
It's up to us.

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
I will listen to you.

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
I will listen to you.

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
It's my fault

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
that I hid the fireworks from you.

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
But Ah Zhi,

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
do you really want to give up

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
our 15 years of love

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
because of a woman?

57
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
As long as you give Zhao Chun Man back to me,

58
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
we will still be good brothers.

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Gu Shi Zhen,

60
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
do you still think that we are here

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
because of Zhao Chun Man?

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
If not, what else could it be?

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
How did we meet?

64
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
You arranged for Fu Lu and Shou Xi to hit me.

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
You came to save me.

66
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,680
We are a gang of people.

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
That time, my hand almost got destroyed.

68
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
In your eyes,

69
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
any human or object

70
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
can be obtained through means.

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Yes,

72
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
I did it on purpose.

73
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
But Ah Zhi,

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
am I not good to you?

75
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
What good things did I not bring you?

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
I didn't give you good things.

77
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
As a big brother, don't I love you enough?

78
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
You think this is love.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Why isn't this love?

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
You all say that I don't know love.

81
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
What is love?

82
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
I gave you all the most precious things I thought were precious.

83
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Why is it still not love?

84
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
You shouldn't lie and lie to me.

85
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
I did it for us.

86
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Don't lie to yourself.

87
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
You did it for yourself.

88
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
You knew about the small warehouse.

89
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
But you didn't tell me about our brother's feelings.

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
But now you want to break up with me.

91
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Is it still because of Zhao Chun?

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
You remember,

93
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
because of a woman,

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
you and my brother didn't do it.

95
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
I said,

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
this has nothing to do with her.

97
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Your things are outside.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
You can't do anything.

99
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
You can't do anything.

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
You can't do anything.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
You can't do anything.

102
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Your things are outside.

103
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Take your things.

104
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Get out.

105
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Get out!

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
I promised you.

107
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
I will take you out.

108
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
I did it.

109
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
But you didn't listen to me.

110
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
The smuggling of the goods.

111
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
I urge you to stop.

112
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I heard that Fulu was killed.

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Yes.

114
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
It should be the people of the Da Dao Sect.

115
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Why did the people of Da Dao Sect kill him?

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
They didn't want to kill Fulu.

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
They wanted to kill me.

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
The price they gave me last time was too low.

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I have been feeling regret.

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
I have been feeling regret.

121
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
What about you?

122
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Fulu told me that you have a small warehouse.

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Did you not feel regret for him?

124
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
How is that possible?

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Besides, I don't have a small warehouse.

126
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Why would I feel regret?

127
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Last time, I was wrong about you.

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
But,

129
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
even if you killed Fulu,

130
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
I supported you.

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
No matter if you have a small warehouse,

132
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
I will protect you.

133
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
No matter if you have a small warehouse,

134
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
it is a fact that Fulu betrayed you.

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
If he betrays you,

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
he deserves to die.

137
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Right?

138
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Yes.

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
In your heart,

140
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
who is more important?

141
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
The Yi Gang.

142
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Which one is more important?

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
The Yi Gang and Nan Cheng.

144
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
The Yi Father is more important.

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Boss is here in Nan Cheng.

146
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
We need to speed up the list of the strong.

147
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
This is the time

148
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
for us to make up our minds.

149
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Why are you here?

150
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,680
What are these?

151
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
All my belongings.

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I was kicked out of the public hall by Gu Chi Chen.

153
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Because of you.

154
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Isn't this what you want?

155
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Why are you blaming me now?

156
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
I have nowhere to go.

157
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
You have nowhere to go?

158
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
You can go to the hotel or the casino.

159
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
If you can't, you can go to Yuchun Theater.

160
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Why do you have to come here?

161
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
What kind of expression is that?

162
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Zhao Chun Man.

163
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
I saved your life.

164
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
How can you treat me like this?

165
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
It's not appropriate.

166
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
People will gossip.

167
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
When did you become afraid of being gossiped by others?

168
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Do you still want to be taken away by Gu Chi Chen?

169
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Just treat me as a tenant.

170
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll pay you.

171
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
I'll pay you.

172
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Then we're even.

173
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Mom.

174
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Aunt.

175
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Our family doesn't welcome people from the same class.

176
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I can go in without water.

177
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
I can go outside without water.

178
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Mom.

179
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
He saved me.

180
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Let him live in the bathroom.

181
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Mom.

182
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
It's okay. The bathroom is pretty good.

183
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
It's dirty.

184
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Go take a shower first.

185
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Are you guys all so dirty?

186
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Get him a clean clothes.

187
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
I'll put the pillow here.

188
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Okay.

189
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
March 2.

190
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Rain.

191
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
When it rains, your shoes will get wet.

192
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Fortunately, I made the road clear before you came.

193
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Today, did you see me?

194
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
I wonder if you remember me.

195
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
That kid is Jiu Chi.

196
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Chen Xi.

197
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Give it to me.

198
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
Give it back to me.

199
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Give him the hairpin.

200
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Don't meddle in our business.

201
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,680
You're blocking our way.

202
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
I fought with him today.

203
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Because of you.

204
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
I will never allow anyone to bully you.

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I can't beat them.

206
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Even the hairpin I got from them.

207
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
I broke it.

208
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
We grow up slowly.

209
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I still can't save enough money.

210
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
To give him the same hairpin.

211
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
If you're here to save your father's life.

212
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
I'll ask you to stop.

213
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
So the God of War.

214
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
He really wants to save me?

215
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
April 30.

216
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Rain.

217
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
I never thought you would come.

218
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
I promised to take you with me.

219
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
But I didn't promise to take you in.

220
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
It's so dangerous up there.

221
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
It's so dangerous up there.

222
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
I can't let you go up there.

223
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
He's been protecting me all this life.

224
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
This shot.

225
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
I won't kill you.

226
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
I hope you can get through this.

227
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
I wanted to save my uncle.

228
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I wanted to save my uncle.

229
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
But I couldn't stop him.

230
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
I was incompetent.

232
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Whose clothes are these?

233
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
My brother's.

234
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
What's wrong with you?

235
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Idiot.

236
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
What did you say?

237
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
I said.

238
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
You're an idiot.

239
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
I didn't expect you to peek at other people's diary.

240
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Yes.

241
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm an idiot.

242
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
I'm an idiot.

243
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
I'm an idiot.

244
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I'm an idiot.

245
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
I'm an idiot.

246
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680

I'm an idiot.

250
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm an idiot.

251
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm an idiot.

252
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
I'm an idiot.

253
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I'm an idiot.

254
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
I'm an idiot.

255
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm an idiot.

256
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
I'm an idiot.

257
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
I'm an idiot.

258
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,680
I'm an idiot.

259
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I'm an idiot.

260
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
I'm an idiot.

261
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm an idiot.

262
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm an idiot.

263
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
I'm an idiot.

264
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
I'm an idiot.

265
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
I'm an idiot.

266
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
I'm an idiot.

267
