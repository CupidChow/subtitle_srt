1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,440
I do.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll give you the clothes.

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Brother Zhen, you're back, but you didn't tell me.

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was looking for you.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Brother Zhen, I'm waiting for you.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm so cold.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're so bold.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How dare you steal my clothes?

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll kill you.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're in trouble.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Lin Feng, I don't know what you're talking about.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You don't know?

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Is that Zhou Chi?

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He has the guts, but he definitely doesn't have the ambition.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come and pick it up.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I heard you're going to sell grass to Zhao Chun.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll make you a good son.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Lin Feng, I really don't know anything.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They'll be back from your warehouse in a while.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You'll know everything.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Master, Brother Zhen.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Master, there's nothing in the warehouse.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Follow the plan and take the goods away.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Brother Zhen.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We've been here for so long.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When will we be able to get out?

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Enough.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Stop.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you doing?

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're not allowed to work tonight. Go back.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Go.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Go.

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Go back.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wait.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wait.

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Go and bury him.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Go.

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go.

40
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I didn't know what happened.

41
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I said I was in my handbag.

42
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I didn't have time to return it to him, so I exchanged it with Luo Yu.

43
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now is not the time to tell them my identity.

44
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's wrong?

45
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Zhao Chun Man misunderstood you and Luo Yu.

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's more troublesome. He misunderstood that I killed Luo Yu.

47
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You two shouldn't have contacted each other.

48
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In order to hide your identities.

49
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The next day

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Little friend, your mask is really pretty.

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can I buy it for you?

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I picked it up. I don't want money.

53
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll give you the money.

54
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Here.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll give you.

56
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you.

57
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Can we buy candy?

58
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is it pretty?

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's pretty.

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's go buy candy.

61
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You like Red Head?

62
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't like the hero who kills the enemy. Do I like you guys?

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Besides, it's none of your business.

64
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My name is Zhao Chun Man.

65
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why are you in my house?

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Get out.

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are not welcome here.

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So you like Red Head K.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Pick it up.

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What a coincidence.

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I also picked up something.

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's yours, right?

73
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What is this?

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know.

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was in a hurry when I changed clothes with Luo Yu.

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What clothes?

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's Luo Yu's, right?

78
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Luo Yu's is also here.

79
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You killed Luo Yu.

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You killed Luo Yu.

81
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So what if I killed him?

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You are so despicable.

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't touch me.

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I wanted to keep your secret.

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But I killed someone.

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Fu Luo, how long have you been following me?

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Brother Zhen, I've been following you for a year.

88
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How do you feel about following me?

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can only support Grandma and myself by following Brother Zhen.

90
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I lost my words.

91
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's the luckiest thing in my life to follow Brother Zhen.

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you have too many words, people will lie.

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What did Zhou Yi Sen do to you?

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How dare you tell him the news?

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
My grandma threatened me.

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I didn't tell her much.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But sometimes I was too forced.

98
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was too tight.

99
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I told her a little bit.

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
A little bit?

101
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't you know that I can't let you betray me?

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Zhou Yi Sen can threaten you with your grandma.

103
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I won't.

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Have you forgotten?

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Your grandma likes me very much.

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Have you told Zhou Yi Sen about Qiangwei Embroidery?

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No.

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Good.

109
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you, Brother Zhen.

110
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Shouldn't you thank me?

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Your mom is not well.

112
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you don't want her to suffer from now on,

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you have to listen to me.

114
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Mom.

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mom.

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Mom.

117
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Mom.

118
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Mom.

119
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Mom.

120
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Go.

121
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Mom.

122
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Did I hear it wrong?

123
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why is she here?

124
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mom.

125
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Mom.

126
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Mom.

127
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This is...

128
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's red peach jelly.

129
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You look ugly with it.

130
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll let you go if you say you love me.

131
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You understand?

132
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Zhou Chunlan.

133
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You should be mine.

134
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You should be mine.

135
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Zhou Chunlan.

136
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The End
