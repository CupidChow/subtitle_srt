1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
discs

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,560
One month later

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Who's there?

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
It's me

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Why are you here at this time of night?

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
I'm here to find something

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,560
What? Do I have to report this to you?

8
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Come to my room later to find me.

9
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,560
I didn't ask. You don't need to explain.

10
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
But there's no next time.

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm going out.

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Zhou Chi, you know I'm using you

13
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
and you're still trying to get rid of me.

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,560
It's because you killed my father and he's guilty.

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
That's why you're helping me.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Send Zhao Chun Man away quickly.

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
If my godfather finds out, it's over.

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Godfather?

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
You're still afraid of your godfather?

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Does godfather know you're stealing his goods?

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
How do you know about this?

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
It doesn't matter. How do I know?

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
What you need to worry about now is...

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Since I can know,

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,560
godfather will know too.

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,560
No matter what, you're my big brother.

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,560
I definitely don't want anything to happen to you.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I'll send Zhao Chun Man away.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Go home and rest.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Be careful of the wound.

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
I'll be there for you again.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
It's okay.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Take your time.

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
You saved me once too.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
I won't see you off again.

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Let's go.

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Let's go in.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Man Man, is that you?

39
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Mom, it's me.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Who is that?

41
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
A friend.

42
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Then why don't you ask her to come in?

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Mom, ask her to come in.

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
She's so warm-hearted.

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
But if she knows

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
that you shot my dad,

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
she won't do it.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
I didn't mean to kill her.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
It's...

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
What is it?

51
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Tell me.

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
It wasn't you who killed my dad.

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
You can kill me anytime to avenge your uncle.

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
So it really was you, Zhao Chi.

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Why don't you ask her to come in?

60
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
You rarely bring your friends home.

61
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Who is she?

62
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Is she pursuing you?

63
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Mom, don't talk nonsense.

64
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,560
The most important thing in a girl's life is to find the right person.

65
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
I just hope

66
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,560
that you find a warm and kind person

67
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
to live with.

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Don't mess with those people anymore.

69
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Don't worry, Mom.

70
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Once Dad's case is settled,

71
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,560
we'll be completely clear.

72
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Okay.

73
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Go to bed early.

74
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
It's not you.

75
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
It's not you.

76
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
The number corresponding to the list of the code

77
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
is also with your father.

78
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
What?

79
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
After the outbreak,

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
buy a bouquet of flowers at the cafe

81
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
and take it to the Nan Cheng Ceremony.

82
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Flowers!

83
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
The rose of the organization will hand it over to you.

84
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Kid, give me a bouquet of flowers.

85
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Okay.

86
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Here you go.

87
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Flowers!

88
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Flowers!

89
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Flowers!

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I also got the news that

91
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
tonight, the Qiangwei Organization

92
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,560
will hand over the list at the wooden roll party.

93
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
I'll be going now.

94
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Arrange for Ah Zhen and Ah Chi

95
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,560
to enter the party as the guest of the fund.

96
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
Search carefully.

97
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Make sure to find the list.

98
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Also let you search all the guests,

99
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
especially Luo Yu

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
and Zhao Chun Man.

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Thank you to all the people who are here.

102
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
The party will now begin.

103
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I wish you all a wonderful night.

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Let's dance.

105
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Mr. Gu, please dance.

106
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Come on.

107
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Come on.

108
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Come on.

109
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Go find the list.

110
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Chi, can I ask you to dance?

111
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Look at me.

112
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I'm your dance partner now.

113
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm your dance partner now.

114
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
The flowers are gone.

115
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Are you looking for someone?

116
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,560
You haven't been in your senses all night.

117
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Thank you.

118
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
You don't have to worry about me.

119
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
What are you doing, Luo Yu?

120
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Luo Yu?

121
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
What are you doing here?

122
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Go away.

123
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Don't be here.

124
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Mr. Gu said you were a rose with thorns.

125
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Rose thorns can hurt others

126
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
and hurt yourself.

127
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Mr. Gu said I was his fiancee.

128
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
What do you think I am?

129
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
A third wheel that steals from its sister?

130
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
A third wheel that doesn't get beaten.

131
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Oh my god.

132
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Isn't he beating a bunch of paper?

133
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Is he?

134
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
He's definitely beating me.

135
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
He's definitely beating me.

136
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
He's definitely beating me.

137
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
This is going to be a big deal.

138
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Zhao Chun Man, you broke me.

139
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Are you okay?

140
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Gu Shi Zhan, everyone knows to wait for you for their woman.

141
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Who says you're my woman?

142
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
You're shameless.

143
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Come with me.

144
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
A sister who steals from her man.

145
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
A brother who fights for his woman.

146
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
That's interesting.

147
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
It hurts. Bear with it.

148
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Have you paid the money?

150
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Yes.

151
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Leave as soon as you're done.

152
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
It's not safe here tonight.

153
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
I'm going out.

154
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
You should go.

155
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
What are you doing here?

156
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm here to see you.

157
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I'm here to see you.

158
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
I'm here to see you.

159
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
I'm here to see you.

160
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Are you okay?

161
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
It's my fault. I was too harsh.

162
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Don't pretend to be a star.

163
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
You...

164
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
You're a rose.

165
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Man Man, I'm sorry.

166
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
I'm sorry. I must have made you sad for a long time.

167
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Are you talking about Gu Shi Zhan?

168
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
You know I care about him.

169
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
I know.

170
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
You care about me betraying you.

171
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
I approach him because the organization needs me.

172
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I don't want you to be involved.

173
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,560
I didn't expect you to be involved.

174
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
You and my father.

175
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
You two have been hiding from me.

176
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
This is the organization's rule.

177
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,560
No one is allowed to reveal their identity to anyone other than the person.

178
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,560
My father and I agreed to hand over the list at Yuchun Theater.

179
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I didn't expect the Zhao family to be caught by the gang.

180
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
I've already detailed the list.

181
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Be sure to keep it well.

182
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Don't worry, Man Man.

183
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Man Man, you have to leave here quickly.

184
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,560
It's not good for the gang to show up here.

185
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
I know.

186
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
You have to leave quickly too.

187
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Be sure to be safe.

188
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Okay.

189
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
It seems that Luo Yu seduced Gu Shi Zhan in Yuchun Theater last night.

190
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
It was also to hand over the list.

191
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Why are you in a hurry?

192
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Where is Zhao Chun Man?

193
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm looking for him.

194
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
I haven't finished my business with him.

195
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Don't look for him.

196
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Talk to me first.

197
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
What are you doing?

198
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Gu Shi Zhan took Luo Yu away.

199
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Will Luo Yu be in trouble?

200
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
I can't change my father's ending.

201
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I can't let Luo Yu be in trouble again.

202
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
I can't let Luo Yu be in trouble again.

203
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
I can't let Luo Yu be in trouble again.

204
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Shi Zhan, what are you doing?

205
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
You just told me to leave him alone.

206
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
What do you want to do now?

207
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Tell me.

208
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
What did you do? Zhou Yi Sen told me to keep an eye on you.

209
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
How do I know why he's staring at me?

210
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
If he really wants to stare at me,

211
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
I'll let you marry me.

212
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
I'll go under his eyes and let him stare.

213
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
What are you doing?

214
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Zhao Chun Man is still here.

215
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Let's go.

216
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Don't you just want to be seen by him?

217
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Be seen by him?

218
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
This is a familiar scene.

219
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Shang Yi was in Yuchun Theater.

220
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Brother and Luo Yu were in the room.

221
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
They went to find Brother.

222
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Isn't it settled in Li Cha Hotel?

223
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
When will this be the end of this life and death?

224
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
No.

225
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Zhao Chun Man, stop.

226
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Zhou Chi, what are you doing?

227
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
It's dangerous here. Hurry up and leave.

228
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
I know. But I have to save Luo Yu.

229
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
You want to save him, I want to save you.

230
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
If you're here to pursue your father's death,

231
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
I'll let you hit him.

232
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

233
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,560
The sun is rising

234
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,560
When a flower falls on the roadside

235
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,560
It's the color of yesterday

236
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Who made a promise to whom?

237
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Who escaped from whom?

238
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,560
The whirlpool of time is confused

239
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:01,560
It's like you and me

240
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,560
I'm in every moment

241
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Looking for your eyes

242
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:19,560
But I'm only chasing

243
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,560
The wind outside the window

244
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,560
