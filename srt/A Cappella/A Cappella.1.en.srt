00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:43,168
A Cappella

2
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,937
I was twenty.

3
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:08,193
I will let no one say
it is the best time of life.

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,739
Everything threatens
a young man with ruin.

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,617
Paul Nizan

6
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,315
Anti-uniform Committee

7
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,112
Kyoko Noma and Julie Kanazawa.

8
00:02:55,258 --> 00:03:01,056
Look at this old fashioned uniform.
It's meant to be respectable!

9
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:08,479
Dowdy Peter Pan collars and socks!
No perms, ribbons or headbands!

10
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,901
We have to follow these
silly rules.

11
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,199
Let's demand that uniforms
are abolished.

12
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,241
Yes!

13
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,162
With stylish clothes we'll
reclaim our rights!

14
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,581
Let's do it!

15
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,582
Yes!

16
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,349
We hereby organize
the Anti-uniform committee.

17
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:51,397
<i>...never give in to
the authority's oppression.</i>

18
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:56,695
<i>This battle affects
every one of us.</i>

19
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,907
<i>I'm addressing
citizens, workers and students.</i>

20
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,785
<i>We need to unite.</i>

21
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,791
<i>The university administrators are
responsible</i>

22
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,587
<i>for pacifying students.</i>

23
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,131
<i>They're oppressive.</i>

24
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:23,138
<i>And we're not taking their
oppression any longer!</i>

25
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,476
<i>It is the embodiment of
Imperialism.</i>

26
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,605
<i>That's what schools are...</i>

27
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,151
We organized an anti-uniform committee.

28
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,320
Go, Revolutionary Rosa!

29
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,408
- You can print flyers at our office.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,494
- The demonstration's on 6/15.
- OK!

31
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,586
Here. Use it for the cause.

32
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,129
Thank you.

33
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,341
- Want ramen?
- No, it's for the cause!

34
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:05,138
Kyoko, do you like classical music?

35
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,974
- Sure.
- Good.

36
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,185
Yes!

37
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,867
Julie should be the Chair.

38
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,870
I'd be lousy.
You do it, Kyoko.

39
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,539
I'd be lousy too!

40
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,792
Julie here will help you out.

41
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,879
Reiko and I'll support you.
It'll be fun.

42
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,854
<i>Embers</i> Poetry Collection  100 yen.

43
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,067
You love poetry...

44
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,361
Thank you.

45
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,364
Kyoko.

46
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,996
<i>A Cappella...?</i>

47
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,498
Just follow us.

48
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:20,421
A Cappella.

49
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,431
What's this?

50
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,940
3 coffees.

51
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,650
Well?

52
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,068
Not bad!

53
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,573
Look at those marks.

54
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,993
They're from people's heads.

55
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,954
Gross!

56
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,760
Coffee please.

57
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,401
Pachelbel's Canon.

58
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,207
Don't you get bored of that?

59
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,239
You bought those poems?

60
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,366
For 100 yen?

61
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,581
150. The extra 50 yen was
a donation.

62
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,336
You're strange.

63
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,257
He's just a spoilt street poet.

64
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,928
Why am I strange?

65
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,222
May I?

66
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,729
The poet and I go to the
same college.

67
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,281
At dawn I saw a wind being born.

68
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,743
It was forlorn
and without direction.

69
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,788
It made waves
and moved a ship.

70
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,124
Tossing leaves,
it hit a wall and died.

71
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,127
And went out
in a trash bag..

72
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,420
What's this?

73
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,632
He's just jerking off.

74
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,301
Give it back.

75
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,271
We're her friends.

76
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,734
I'm Reiko and this is Julie.

77
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,320
High school girls?

78
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,617
Seniors at Sendai All-girls' High.

79
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,788
Kyoko is our <i>Revolutionary Rosa.</i>

80
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,832
Nice to meet you.

81
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,335
Revolutionary Rosa? Wow.

82
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,838
It's just a nickname.

83
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,341
So your school has
an anti-war group now.

84
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,302
Nothing so organized.

85
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,848
We just oppose school uniforms.

86
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,187
You're the Chair?

87
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,981
Kind of.

88
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,027
You make speeches?

89
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,696
From now.

90
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,325
You must have fun every day...

91
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:09,377
You talk to me like I'm a child.

92
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,550
I didn't mean to.

93
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,342
Sorry.

94
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,469
Thank you.

95
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,988
You know this piece?

96
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,953
It's Pachelbel's Canon.

97
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,666
Should I?

98
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,469
It's beautiful.

99
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:50,038
<i>...as a result 18 students
have been arrested so far.</i>

100
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,875
<i>Since barricading off Tokyo University</i>

101
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,796
<i>the student activists' struggle
is spreading </i>

102
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,716
<i>to high schools across Japan.</i>

103
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:07,055
<i>Many graduates are boycotting
commencements...</i>

104
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,978
Arrest them and shoot them!

105
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,397
Parents paid tuition for that?

106
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,571
Kyoko is late.

107
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,343
Noma Family.

108
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,274
You're late!

109
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,117
I was studying with friends.

110
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,746
Honey...

111
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,794
Hi, Kyoko. I brought
some strawberries.

112
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,300
Thanks for letting me stay
with you.

113
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,637
Aunt Aiko came to eat with us.

114
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,307
Aiko, don't be too soft on her.

115
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,726
Yes, please.

116
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,603
Kyoko.

117
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,651
No political activities
or skipping class.

118
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,987
Kyoko, I won't spoil you.

119
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,990
Your curfew is 7 o'clock.

120
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,993
You forgot to pack this.

121
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,963
Where were you really, Sis?

122
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,592
At a baroque cafe

123
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,011
talking about the Security Treaty.

124
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:15,183
<i>Abolish the Treaty!
Victory is ours!</i>

125
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,521
Sis.

126
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,650
Don't give Birdie any spinach.

127
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,113
It'll give her diarrhea.

128
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:32,200
I'll take good care of her.

129
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,288
Auntie Aiko might give her spinach.

130
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,708
I'll make sure she won't.

131
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,544
Time to sleep.

132
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,047
Good night.

133
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,716
Night.

134
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:23,418
<i>Dad's forced smile
lingers like a funeral photo.</i>

135
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,340
<i>A new life away from my parents.</i>

136
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,928
<i>Will it make any difference to me?</i>

137
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:45,398
We're people, not a herd of sheep.

138
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,069
And people have the
freedom of speech!

139
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,571
Yes!

140
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,574
Why should we give it up?

141
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:59,287
Stop eating from the belt feeder!
We'll smash it!

142
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,622
Right!

143
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,712
Come down, girls!

144
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,304
You've been suspended?

145
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,940
Shame on you!
You embarrassed your aunt!

146
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,235
<i>Shame?</i>

147
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,281
You know nothing.
Don't get all preachy.

148
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,159
Here.

149
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,496
It's me. It must be a mistake.

150
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,334
I'll watch her.

151
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,094
<i>I'm just copying.</i>

152
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:03,018
<i>I hate myself for that. I wonder
if Julie and Reiko feel the same.</i>

153
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,688
<i>It's easier if I think they do.</i>

154
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,191
<i>I feel calmer.</i>

155
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:13,612
Kyoko.

156
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,989
Julie.

157
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,044
Reiko!

158
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,461
Reiko.

159
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,340
How's it going?

160
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,813
<i>They cast long stripes of shadows.</i>

161
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,691
<i>All lined up in identical poses.</i>

162
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,985
<i>They all bow their heads but one.</i>

163
00:19:54,235 --> 00:20:00,033
<i>Only one who
looks away indignantly.</i>

164
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,580
<i>That's me, the seal who
hates seals.</i>

165
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,501
<i>But a seal is still a seal.</i>

166
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,879
<i>I'm just looking the other way.</i>

167
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:19,427
<i>I don't really care about
the Vietnam or anything.</i>

168
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:25,391
<i>I'm just trying to stand
in the storm so I won't go mad.</i>

169
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,435
Go away!

170
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,439
Go away, police!

171
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,276
Leave us alone!

172
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,537
Leave!

173
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,539
Leave!

174
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,971
Run!

175
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:48,600
<i>I was born with
emotions that bleed.</i>

176
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,437
<i>My flesh will never bleed...</i>

177
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:39,317
<i>The blue sky framed by
riot shields</i>

178
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:45,073
<i>wasn't the same sky I saw
at school with Julie and Reiko.</i>

179
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,751
You alone?

180
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,006
Meeting someone?

181
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,344
Can we join you?

182
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:30,952
- Were you at the demonstration?
- Uh, yes...

183
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,246
Did you get hurt?

184
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,749
A badge of honor.

185
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,209
Hardly.

186
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,255
As a senior you must be... 18?

187
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,633
- 17.
- Like Emma.

188
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,927
- Emma?
- She was here that day.

189
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,304
Oh, your girlfriend.

190
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,725
And you are... Kyoko.

191
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,102
That's right.

192
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:13,453
My name was hard for kids when we
moved for dad's job.

193
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,331
Ah, the life of a bohemian!

194
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,477
- Domoto...
- Wataru.

195
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,163
And Yunosuke Seki.

196
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:03,044
We've been friends forever and we
go to the same college.

197
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:07,716
His family owns Sengendo,
the sweet shop.

198
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,677
That your family's?

199
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,223
It is but he's
crashing at my place.

200
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,068
Are you OK?

201
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,403
Yeah.

202
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:31,907
You sure?

203
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,206
I'll wash it for you.

204
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,762
Wataru's girl!

205
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,230
Nice to know you.

206
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,441
The movie will start soon.

207
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:11,446
Excuse us.
You can stick around with Wataru.

208
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,099
Is this out of rivalry?

209
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,935
How come?

210
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:49,150
You're here because
Yunosuke went out with Emma.

211
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,155
I can't just ask you
for sex straight out.

212
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,994
Try me.

213
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,330
Don't pretend....

214
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,501
I know you're sweet and innocent.

215
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,680
Wataru.

216
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:26,980
Is there anything worth
hanging onto in life?

217
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:39,535
Love between two people...?

218
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,711
Without love would revolutions happen?

219
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,823
Without love revolutions
wouldn't happen..

220
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:23,198
<i>The next stop is Rinnoji Temple.</i>

221
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,035
<i>We'll stop here.</i>

222
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,301
Hi.

223
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,386
Hello.

224
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,013
Let's go.

225
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,577
It's nice and quiet.

226
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,414
Where's Yunosuke?

227
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,541
At home.

228
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,670
He didn't go out?

229
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:21,923
He and Emma are listening to records.

230
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:25,260
Right.

231
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,279
We're here.

232
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:57,584
Go in.

233
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:41,002
Relax.
We won't do tea ceremony.

234
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:06,027
Know why the entrance's small?

235
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,705
When you enter,
you leave the ordinary world.

236
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,391
We're in the <i>other world.</i>

237
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,059
It's nice here.

238
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:42,355
- Did you want beer?
- No, this is OK.

239
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:57,370
Is Setsuko coming back for summer?

240
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,666
Dunno. She hasn't called.

241
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,085
Has Kyoko met Setsuko?

242
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,505
- Who is she?
- Wataru's sister.

243
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,925
Just wait!
She's like a movie star.

244
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:16,682
- Their story's so sad...
- Don't talk about that.

245
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:19,893
- Why?
- You're not entitled to.

246
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,770
Don't be mad.

247
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:26,733
You're no expert
on people's private lives.

248
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:31,279
You mock like a tabloid writer.

249
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,544
It's OK. Don't argue about it.

250
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,423
Kyoko, want to get cigarettes?

251
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,639
Can you get some beer too?

252
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,329
Wataru's mother killed herself.

253
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,582
She did?

254
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,420
Wataru and his sister were kids
when they found her hanging.

255
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:41,266
- Do you like Mick Jagger?
- Yes.

256
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,853
He'll be cool when he's middle-aged.

257
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,857
So will Yunosuke and Wataru.
Don't you think?

258
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,364
I can't imagine.

259
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:00,536
A middle-aged Wataru...

260
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,975
- We're back.
- Hey.

261
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,068
- Your beer.
- Thanks.

262
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:40,927
Emma.

263
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:54,399
Sorry I was angry.

264
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:57,653
I know Wataru is a sore point
with you.

265
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,279
That's not it.

266
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,490
I was just irritable.

267
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:05,410
Sorry.

268
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,871
Are you drunk?

269
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:08,056
We should leave them alone.

270
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,916
Let's go...

271
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,425
Aren't you going, Wataru?

272
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:53,935
See?

273
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,273
Emma's wet now.

274
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:18,794
Are you mad?

275
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,755
Why would I be mad?

276
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:42,483
This is yours.

277
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,326
I love you, Kyoko.

278
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,914
Oh, why is that?

279
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:00,335
Do I need a reason?

280
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:15,243
<i>Paging Dr. Miyamoto.</i>

281
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:36,723
Why'd you do it?

282
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:42,270
I was bored.

283
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:44,773
That's all.

284
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,902
What a big bag!

285
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:34,405
I'm supposed to
be at cram school.

286
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,827
Where do you two do it?

287
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:44,082
Sex! Yunosuke and I
use the teahouse.

288
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,433
Kyoko.

289
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:06,479
Do you love life?

290
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:12,360
You mean... living?

291
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,531
Life itself.

292
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:24,039
I don't know what you mean
but I guess so.

293
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:31,880
Summer mornings before
anybody's up.

294
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:35,842
Snow-covered evenings.

295
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:39,888
Stormy days...

296
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:44,726
I'm so heartsick I want to cry.

297
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:53,318
I feel present.
I'm right here.

298
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,988
That's all I need to know.

299
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,994
That's beautiful.

300
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,003
Wataru, you know that night...

301
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,550
We kissed under the moon.

302
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:23,389
There were no American
footsteps on it then.

303
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,072
Kyoko!

304
00:45:58,383 --> 00:45:59,926
Kyoko!

305
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:18,737
Wataru.

306
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:23,241
Can we meet alone next time?

307
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:25,661
Sure.

308
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:14,042
<i>Wataru and Yunosuke look past
us girls into the distance.</i>

309
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,712
Are you a virgin?

310
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:25,011
Maybe...
I'll leave it to your imagination.

311
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:31,893
Hey.

312
00:47:34,896 --> 00:47:37,899
Do you still want to die?

313
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,901
All the time.

314
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:46,575
But you won't die
if you're thinking about death.

315
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:52,748
The danger is
when your mind goes blank.

316
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:01,590
Don't you dare!

317
00:48:03,466 --> 00:48:07,596
You have a pink bomb
waiting inside you.

318
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:15,521
Set it off grandly so
it knocks men off their feet.

319
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:17,564
Sound good?

320
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:23,111
Not bad.

321
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,804
- So Yunosuke's in Tokyo?
- Yes.

322
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:51,306
Emma hated being left here.

323
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:56,477
Kyoko, there's someone
I want you to meet.

324
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,993
- My sister.
- Kyoko.

325
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,495
Hi, I'm Setsuko.

326
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,164
Hi.

327
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:18,333
She's pretty.

328
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:22,838
You're the first girlfriend
I've ever met.

329
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:25,841
So I'm pretty excited to
meet you.

330
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:29,302
I'm cold.

331
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:31,429
Don't you have a coat?

332
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:34,600
I feel cold because
I have my period.

333
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:37,018
You had a painkiller?

334
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:39,354
Let's go then.

335
00:49:46,903 --> 00:49:48,279
Isn't she great?

336
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,118
Too good for you.

337
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:55,328
She is.

338
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:27,068
<i>Setsuko is beautiful.</i>

339
00:50:30,071 --> 00:50:34,075
<i>I felt like an
ugly high school girl.</i>

340
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,244
<i>I was miserable.</i>

341
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:42,584
<i>I'd have run and hid if I could.</i>

342
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:46,087
<i>I was jealous of Setsuko.</i>

343
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:50,926
<i>It brought out something in me.</i>

344
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,783
Hello.

345
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,452
- Hi.
- How are you?

346
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,122
I better go.

347
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:22,791
Already?

348
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:25,586
Sit down.

349
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:30,465
Seeing you two makes me feel lonely.

350
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:32,383
I can walk you home.

351
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:35,721
It's OK. I just feel dizzy.

352
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:39,891
Wataru, you should
come home sometimes.

353
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:42,978
I will if you are there.

354
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,183
I'd better walk her home.

355
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:30,942
<i>Why does he behave as if.</i>

356
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:34,112
<i>Setsuko is his girlfriend?</i>

357
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:40,368
<i>Is it possible that
Wataru and Setsuko</i>

358
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,955
<i>have made love?</i>

359
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,377
Wataru!

360
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,714
Piano Lessons.

361
00:52:51,337 --> 00:52:52,714
Why are you here?

362
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,551
To learn piano.

363
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,389
Happy birthday.

364
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:07,395
Thank you.

365
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,317
Kyoko, the neighbors can see us!

366
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:13,819
I don't care.

367
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,155
- Come in.
- What about your aunt?

368
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,659
She'll be at a recital until 8.

369
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,663
I'm like your lover.

370
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:48,604
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

371
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:52,691
You can sit here.

372
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:04,745
Use this as an ashtray.

373
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:08,749
See this?

374
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:14,420
I thought about it and decided
to give you my favorite record.

375
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,759
I hope you like it.

376
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:26,767
Don't you like Tchaikovsky?

377
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:29,227
I love him.

378
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:31,772
Thank you.

379
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:21,988
Wataru.

380
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:28,537
You seem distracted...

381
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:35,126
Is that how I look?

382
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:36,878
Yes.

383
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:44,886
Even when we're laughing and
talking together

384
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:49,057
you aren't with me.

385
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:52,561
You're far away.

386
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:01,903
I'm more aware of it
the longer I know you.

387
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:14,249
It's as if half of you
is in a distant universe.

388
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:22,924
Sorry.

389
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:26,344
I don't know what it is.

390
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:29,055
Just forget it.

391
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:43,004
Stop!

392
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,431
It's Setsuko, isn't it?

393
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,482
I know Setsuko's the only
one you can love.

394
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:46,985
You don't have to hide it,
it's obvious.

395
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:57,412
I don't mind at all.

396
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:05,336
Siblings with unhappy pasts
must have a strong bond.

397
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:06,880
That's silly.

398
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,384
I don't love my sister.

399
00:59:15,263 --> 00:59:19,935
Who do you love then?

400
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:38,537
I'll answer it.

401
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:48,046
Hello?

402
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,091
Is this Kyoko Noma?

403
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:55,095
Yunosuke?

404
00:59:58,306 --> 01:00:01,810
It's your birthday, right?
Happy birthday.

405
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:05,480
Thank you.

406
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:09,651
Is Wataru there?

407
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:14,615
Put him on.

408
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:20,411
Setsuko's in hospital.
She tried to kill herself.

409
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:33,634
Why did Setsuko do it...?

410
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:42,350
She had a boyfriend in Tokyo and
they broke up.

411
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:48,774
Is she OK?

412
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,527
Looks like she'll be OK.

413
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,544
Sorry, Kyoko.

414
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:11,880
We'll celebrate later.

415
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:09,270
You were out sick! Proof that
you're human!

416
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:26,037
You missed the consultation
about college.

417
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:29,249
I'm too tired.

418
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,878
Did you decide?

419
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,379
Not yet.

420
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,464
And you?

421
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:39,801
I want to go to a Tokyo art school.

422
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:41,970
No matter what.

423
01:02:44,305 --> 01:02:45,473
What's this?

424
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:51,479
Mom's pickled garlic.
For stamina.

425
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:03,992
Oh, I feel horny...

426
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:10,916
Cut it out!

427
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,459
Julie.

428
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,421
Sorry.

429
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:17,798
What for?

430
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,301
For quitting the Committee...

431
01:03:21,968 --> 01:03:24,095
No hurt feelings!

432
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:28,850
But let's sabotage
the graduation ceremony?

433
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:46,618
Application for Admission.

434
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:22,403
Stop it!

435
01:04:30,453 --> 01:04:31,496
Kyoko.

436
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:40,255
Sit down.

437
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:03,570
You don't go to cram school.

438
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:07,783
And you skip classes at
high school too.

439
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:11,286
What do you want?

440
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:14,956
How about college?

441
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:17,543
Dad.

442
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,630
I want to stay another year.

443
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,134
And bother your aunt?

444
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,554
I don't mind...

445
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:32,057
Your aunt kindly let you
live here

446
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:35,977
and you return the favor by
embarrassing her.

447
01:05:37,478 --> 01:05:39,648
When did I embarrass her?

448
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,318
This is my life.

449
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:47,989
Are you involved in activism?

450
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:53,286
It's not that.

451
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:59,000
Activism is risky.
You could die doing it!

452
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:04,673
You'd never understand!

453
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:10,303
You're just a
groveling office worker.

454
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,974
Your life is controlled.
How could you get it?

455
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:18,687
Get out.

456
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:21,523
Get out.

457
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:29,615
No! Come back and make up.

458
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:32,659
Kyoko!

459
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:53,138
Pachelbel's Canon.

460
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:06,902
So silly.

461
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:10,572
What is?

462
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:15,577
You heard me?

463
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:24,085
Dad slapped me.

464
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,255
He's a good dad.

465
01:07:27,964 --> 01:07:29,215
How come?

466
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:33,094
My father's never hit me.

467
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:37,265
He must be fair and gentle.

468
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,602
No. He's a coward.

469
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:46,692
I've never felt love
from my father. Not once.

470
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:49,903
Oh...

471
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,782
You had a nice upbringing.

472
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:56,451
A classy girl.

473
01:07:56,827 --> 01:08:00,246
No. I'm ordinary.

474
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:08,964
- How's Wataru?
- He's down with a cold.

475
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:12,467
You can visit him.

476
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:17,138
Yes, I might do that.

477
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:24,730
Later.

478
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:29,400
- Say Hi to Emma.
- Okay, I will.

479
01:09:07,648 --> 01:09:08,774
What's up?

480
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:14,320
I heard you had a cold.
Are you OK?

481
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:31,046
Mom gives me this
when I have a cold.

482
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,214
- Want some?
- Thanks.

483
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:41,890
I'll get a plate.

484
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:08,249
Wataru. Why did you decide
to go to college?

485
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:09,751
Me?

486
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:15,757
To become a poet.

487
01:10:19,177 --> 01:10:20,095
Kidding.

488
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:24,349
I wanted a socially condoned
4-year vacation.

489
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:26,351
And you?

490
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:28,436
Well...

491
01:10:30,271 --> 01:10:35,110
I want a wild life but I don't
want people to think I'm dumb.

492
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:38,697
How egocentric!

493
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:39,781
Right.

494
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:43,201
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

495
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:53,461
So I have to study for
the college entrance exams.

496
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,465
You going to Tokyo?

497
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:03,304
I want to stay here.

498
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,599
Forever.

499
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,103
Why?

500
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:14,983
Can't you guess?

501
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:20,989
Forget it.

502
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:30,666
Because you don't
want to leave me?

503
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,302
Exactly.

504
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:46,807
I don't wanna leave you.

505
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:10,664
You're feverish.

506
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:13,709
I feel lightheaded and nice.

507
01:15:08,174 --> 01:15:11,219
Please... This is my first time.

508
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:12,721
Okay.

509
01:16:04,397 --> 01:16:07,693
Kyoko, I love you.

510
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:00,453
Kyoko.

511
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:05,834
Kyoko.

512
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:43,789
Leave! Right now!

513
01:17:52,463 --> 01:17:55,551
Was he watching us the whole time?

514
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:57,468
- Forget about him.
- No!

515
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:03,183
Why was he watching us?
What's wrong with him?

516
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:09,690
I didn't know Yunosuke was
like that.

517
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:12,358
No, you're wrong about him...

518
01:18:52,023 --> 01:18:53,441
Thank you, Ma'am.

519
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:55,276
See you next week.

520
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:56,612
Bye-bye.

521
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,468
Feeling better?

522
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:23,388
I'm hungry.

523
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:32,898
Mr. Domoto called you many times.

524
01:19:34,107 --> 01:19:37,485
He is very worried about
your fever.

525
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:43,784
Is he your boyfriend?

526
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:51,499
I won't tell your dad.
So please don't fight with him.

527
01:19:56,922 --> 01:19:58,507
I won't.

528
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:05,096
I'll focus on the college
entrance exams.

529
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:08,934
Maybe the fever made you wiser!

530
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:22,698
Hello?

531
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:25,534
Hello.

532
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:28,369
Kyoko?

533
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:36,377
You've got the wrong number.

534
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:45,887
Promise me that we'll meet
when you're better.

535
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:49,224
I love you, Kyoko.

536
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:54,813
Me too.

537
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:58,233
I love you.

538
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:04,239
Sabotage the graduation ceremony!

539
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:13,164
Students, join the cause!

540
01:21:13,414 --> 01:21:16,835
This school's archaic administration

541
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:22,591
mirrors the authority's tyranny!

542
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:27,929
The bourgeoisie uses education
to tame us!

543
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:33,393
Schools produce
an obedient labor force.

544
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:36,396
It should be condemned!

545
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:41,943
So we'll sabotage
the graduation ceremony!

546
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:47,574
We refuse to be a product
of oppression.

547
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:50,536
We don't want their education!

548
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:51,953
Yes!

549
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:54,623
Come down!

550
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:59,044
Stop this misconduct!

551
01:22:28,364 --> 01:22:33,829
<i>I could say things calmed down
but I don't know what that means.</i>

552
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:40,168
<i>I suspect there is no such
state as calm.</i>

553
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:45,173
<i>I'm left behind in time.</i>

554
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:49,010
<i>So what if I am...?</i>

555
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:28,008
<i>Abolish the Security Treaty!
Free Okinawa!</i>

556
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:49,029
Okinawa! Treaty!

557
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:49,297
Your favorite writers.

558
01:24:52,258 --> 01:24:57,222
Boris Vian, Camus
and Yumiko Kurahashi.

559
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,809
Favorite poets.

560
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:06,064
Mitsuharu Kaneko and Baudelaire.

561
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:08,441
Also Paul Eluard.

562
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:11,653
Musicians?

563
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:13,655
The Bee Gees.

564
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:18,744
Karl Marx?

565
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:21,997
I don't understand Marx.

566
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:25,959
Nor Kazumi Takahashi's poems.

567
01:25:37,137 --> 01:25:41,016
I confess to loving Sagan.

568
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:44,686
I love <i>Bonjour Tristesse, too.</i>

569
01:25:48,064 --> 01:25:49,482
Make a sad face.

570
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:54,696
Hello, Sadness.

571
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:04,039
Why don't the 4 of us go to the sea?

572
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,042
You know...

573
01:26:07,584 --> 01:26:13,131
I don't understand why
you want Yunosuke for a friend.

574
01:26:16,217 --> 01:26:19,012
I do feel uneasy with him.

575
01:26:20,221 --> 01:26:22,558
I can't trust him completely.

576
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:26,978
He's just an eccentric voyeur.

577
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:30,816
He still bothers you.

578
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:38,239
Wataru, rent an apartment.

579
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:42,828
We can be together all night.

580
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:44,245
Promise?

581
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:24,119
<i>I'm drowning in the real world.</i>

582
01:27:24,285 --> 01:27:30,959
<i>It's amusing to think of myself
as a drowned body floating on waves.</i>

583
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:33,962
<i>It's fine.</i>

584
01:27:35,463 --> 01:27:39,926
<i>To be a drowned body
is not bad at all.</i>

585
01:27:45,181 --> 01:27:48,476
<i>The waves can be rough and cold.</i>

586
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:52,648
<i>But a drowned body feels nothing.</i>

587
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,736
<i>I bloat up purple</i>

588
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:01,907
<i>and wait to wash up somewhere.</i>

589
01:29:12,393 --> 01:29:15,897
Come to my place next Saturday.

590
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:18,316
My aunt's going away.

591
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:21,361
I'll come round 5.

592
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:24,740
Just us two, all night.

593
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:27,899
Kyoko, let me in!

594
01:33:29,943 --> 01:33:30,986
Kyoko.

595
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:34,781
Kyoko, please!

596
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:37,826
Kyoko.

597
01:33:41,412 --> 01:33:42,413
Kyoko.

598
01:35:14,422 --> 01:35:16,758
I loved Yunosuke.

599
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:29,938
And he loved me.

600
01:35:42,576 --> 01:35:44,786
How did it happen...

601
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:52,293
...I don't really know.

602
01:36:04,014 --> 01:36:07,308
We couldn't be without one another.

603
01:36:14,566 --> 01:36:16,109
For 2 years...

604
01:36:22,783 --> 01:36:25,076
it wasn't quite like that.

605
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:35,837
Because we promised to end it.

606
01:36:40,091 --> 01:36:42,343
When he met Emma.

607
01:36:44,345 --> 01:36:46,347
I felt saved.

608
01:36:52,854 --> 01:36:54,856
But I was wrong.

609
01:36:57,442 --> 01:37:00,320
He made out with her
in front of me

610
01:37:02,864 --> 01:37:04,616
and I felt lonely.

611
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:12,666
That's when I met you.

612
01:37:19,422 --> 01:37:22,133
But I really love you.

613
01:37:29,099 --> 01:37:31,560
Then it got out of control.

614
01:37:35,396 --> 01:37:37,148
On that snowy day...

615
01:37:41,903 --> 01:37:45,073
I was happy to see
Yunosuke jealous.

616
01:38:49,971 --> 01:38:51,598
Tell me...

617
01:38:56,227 --> 01:38:58,313
What should I do?

618
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:24,172
Only you can decide.

619
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:40,689
I loved you.

620
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:55,370
I loved you so much.

621
01:41:04,565 --> 01:41:07,568
<i>Platonic love isn't possible.</i>

622
01:41:14,575 --> 01:41:18,954
<i>When we hold back on lust</i>

623
01:41:19,663 --> 01:41:22,457
<i>we make love spiritually.</i>

624
01:41:24,209 --> 01:41:29,297
<i>That's what they did.
I'm so jealous I could die.</i>

625
01:42:03,498 --> 01:42:04,833
Kyoko?

626
01:42:07,043 --> 01:42:08,336
Hello!

627
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:17,012
- You look great.
- Thanks.

628
01:42:18,514 --> 01:42:19,931
No one home?

629
01:42:20,473 --> 01:42:23,351
Looks like Yunosuke's gone to Tokyo.

630
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:32,360
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes.

631
01:42:57,719 --> 01:43:01,723
If I chew gum when I smoke
it feels less unhealthy.

632
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:05,977
- Too late to worry about health.
- I know but...

633
01:43:06,645 --> 01:43:08,730
It's not just for me.

634
01:43:41,597 --> 01:43:43,181
I'm pregnant.

635
01:43:55,443 --> 01:43:57,445
Almost 5 months.

636
01:44:02,784 --> 01:44:05,411
How about congratulating me?

637
01:44:06,788 --> 01:44:08,540
- You'll have it?
- Of course.

638
01:44:25,516 --> 01:44:29,561
- What's Yunosuke want?
- To abort but I won't!

639
01:44:31,312 --> 01:44:33,439
What about him?

640
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:40,488
You don't have to worry.
We'll work it out.

641
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:44,951
- Will you get married?
- Not yet.

642
01:44:45,326 --> 01:44:48,789
But we're having a baby!

643
01:44:49,455 --> 01:44:52,834
I'll leave home when my tummy gets big.

644
01:44:53,459 --> 01:44:56,171
And move in with Yunosuke.

645
01:45:25,701 --> 01:45:27,285
I'll help you.

646
01:45:31,164 --> 01:45:34,000
<i>I guess that's life.</i>

647
01:45:35,376 --> 01:45:40,716
<i>Sometimes you have to steal
the one you love</i>

648
01:45:41,299 --> 01:45:43,635
<i>even if it's sinful.</i>

649
01:46:04,197 --> 01:46:06,199
I love you, Wataru.

650
01:46:07,033 --> 01:46:08,409
I love you too.

651
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:47,365
A Cappella.

652
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:02,631
Kyoko!

653
01:47:07,343 --> 01:47:08,428
A coffee.

654
01:47:18,647 --> 01:47:20,982
The 4 of us haven't met in a while!

655
01:47:21,316 --> 01:47:23,151
- How's it going?
- Perfect.

656
01:47:27,155 --> 01:47:30,491
Congratulations.
You'll be a dad soon.

657
01:47:40,335 --> 01:47:43,338
Sorry but we have to go.

658
01:47:48,134 --> 01:47:49,177
See you.

659
01:47:50,011 --> 01:47:51,513
Don't fall over!

660
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,849
I'm fine. I'm with him.

661
01:48:14,202 --> 01:48:15,495
What's wrong?

662
01:48:24,295 --> 01:48:26,632
I believe she doesn't know...?

663
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:31,011
No.

664
01:48:33,221 --> 01:48:35,056
I wouldn't tell her.

665
01:48:37,934 --> 01:48:40,061
You're strange.

666
01:48:41,938 --> 01:48:43,314
I'm ordinary.

667
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:51,907
You know why I wouldn't tell her.

668
01:48:53,408 --> 01:48:55,410
Don't you?

669
01:48:59,247 --> 01:49:00,498
I do.

670
01:49:04,753 --> 01:49:09,424
Besides Emma's happy now.

671
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:24,606
I can smell apples.

672
01:49:39,162 --> 01:49:42,958
I want to name the baby <i>Mick.</i>

673
01:49:44,292 --> 01:49:45,877
I prefer <i>Giovanni</i>.

674
01:49:46,127 --> 01:49:47,629
No!

675
01:50:45,186 --> 01:50:47,188
You're out late...

676
01:50:49,983 --> 01:50:51,359
Going somewhere?

677
01:51:11,963 --> 01:51:13,214
Yunosuke!

678
01:51:18,261 --> 01:51:20,221
The Chiba residence.

679
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:24,017
Please hold.

680
01:51:27,896 --> 01:51:30,065
A woman named Domoto.

681
01:51:32,859 --> 01:51:35,070
Hello, Setsuko?

682
01:51:36,154 --> 01:51:39,741
Kyoko? I'm at the police station.

683
01:51:40,408 --> 01:51:44,079
You know Wataru's friend, Emma?

684
01:51:44,913 --> 01:51:46,247
She was killed.

685
01:51:55,716 --> 01:51:57,509
Hello?

686
01:51:59,385 --> 01:52:00,554
Kyoko?

687
01:52:14,109 --> 01:52:15,443
Emma...

688
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:20,281
Emma!

689
01:52:23,785 --> 01:52:25,120
What's wrong?

690
01:52:28,248 --> 01:52:30,584
Emma was murdered!

691
01:52:33,086 --> 01:52:35,631
Emma was murdered!

692
01:53:12,876 --> 01:53:14,335
Wataru...

693
01:53:18,006 --> 01:53:19,841
He's gone.

694
01:53:26,848 --> 01:53:28,474
Oh, my God...

695
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,522
Yunosuke's gone.

696
01:53:57,212 --> 01:53:58,505
Yunosuke!

697
01:54:00,048 --> 01:54:03,885
Where were you?
I've been so worried.

698
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:11,852
I roamed the Iwate countryside
because the world is ending.

699
01:54:14,062 --> 01:54:15,188
Wataru.

700
01:54:17,733 --> 01:54:19,234
It was amazing!

701
01:54:21,069 --> 01:54:23,238
I've never felt so free.

702
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:27,909
So...

703
01:54:30,328 --> 01:54:32,748
Just for 2 days of freedom.

704
01:54:35,041 --> 01:54:36,918
I committed a crime.

705
01:55:06,532 --> 01:55:08,283
Yunosuke Seki?

706
01:55:27,343 --> 01:55:29,638
No, he didn't do it!

707
01:55:29,805 --> 01:55:31,264
I killed her!

708
01:55:32,558 --> 01:55:35,143
Yunosuke, no!

709
01:55:38,814 --> 01:55:40,566
I killed her!

710
01:56:01,587 --> 01:56:04,089
No! Don't!

711
01:56:05,674 --> 01:56:06,925
Yunosuke!

712
01:56:11,888 --> 01:56:15,767
He didn't do it. I killed her!

713
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:43,211
Hello?

714
01:56:53,555 --> 01:56:55,015
Is this Wataru?

715
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,568
Where are you?

716
01:57:12,448 --> 01:57:15,869
The seaside? Tell me where.

717
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,251
Listen...

718
01:57:27,589 --> 01:57:31,342
Yunosuke and I planned
to murder Emma.

719
01:57:37,974 --> 01:57:40,268
I thought he was joking.

720
01:57:42,437 --> 01:57:44,940
But he wasn't.

721
01:57:49,528 --> 01:57:51,362
If not for me

722
01:57:55,617 --> 01:57:57,786
he wouldn't have killed Emma.

723
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:06,545
So it's my crime too.

724
01:58:08,797 --> 01:58:15,136
Yunosuke might have been saved if you'd
told the police about you two.

725
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:20,141
Because this is our fate.

726
01:58:26,147 --> 01:58:27,440
Why...?

727
01:58:29,568 --> 01:58:31,152
Why would you...?

728
01:58:36,867 --> 01:58:38,409
Listen, Kyoko.

729
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:47,002
I have to tell you this.

730
01:58:55,677 --> 01:58:56,845
Kyoko...

731
01:59:10,692 --> 01:59:13,361
You're the first woman
I ever loved.

732
01:59:22,078 --> 01:59:24,164
<i>How clumsy I was...</i>

733
01:59:29,711 --> 01:59:31,212
<i>Forgive me.</i>

734
01:59:37,218 --> 01:59:39,470
<i>I'm out of money.</i>

735
01:59:41,973 --> 01:59:43,391
No!

736
01:59:43,934 --> 01:59:47,228
I'll call you... Wataru!

737
02:02:24,803 --> 02:02:27,848
There was no suicide note
except...

738
02:02:40,902 --> 02:02:41,903
