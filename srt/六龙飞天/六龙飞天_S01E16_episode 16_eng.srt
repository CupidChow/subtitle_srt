00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,590
 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,890
Jo Ban of the Jo Family from Bae Joo is involved in a conspiracy.

3
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,710
Do you have an evidence of Jo Ban's involvement in a conspiracy?

4
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,630
This is the evidence.

5
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,070
Teacher, you are wrong and I got it right.

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,370
Hong In Bang has fabricated a conspiracy case.

7
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,040
I know that an appeal for my impeachment has been raised in the Do Dang.

8
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,420
I also know that all of you are gathered here for a vote regarding that.

9
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,840
But...

10
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,270
Instead of the current case at hand, don't you think that the conspiracy I just exposed is more urgent?

11
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,250
In order to investigate Jo Ban,

12
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:53,750
I am requesting a decision regarding Jo Ban's arrest which I did without obtaining permission first.

13
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,890
- Butâ€”
- If we investigate Jo Ban,

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,160
my impeachment case will also be naturally decided.

15
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:13,920


16
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,020
Seventy people approved of Jo Ban's arrest.

17
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,350
The people on General's side also approved of the arrest.

18
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,110
The number of members who think that Jo Ban is involved in a conspiracy is not seventy,
 (Lee Seong Gye) 

19
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,860
but seventy people think that this case must be clearly exposed.

20
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,750
That's right. It must be clearly settled

21
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,740
who is behind that man.

22
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,440
Then, I will go report the decision of the Do Dang to His Highness and receive the royal documents.

23
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,520
It is true that Jo Ban killed Lee Kwang.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Then, is it true that Jo Ban is involved in a conspiracy?

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,910
Is that even possible? Lord Jo Ban involved in a conspiracy?

26
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,940
Whether it is a conspiracy or not, things have become complicated.
 (Yeon Hee) 

27
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,730
There will be an interrogation of the suspect now but don't you think that Hong In Bang is already in control of the investigation office?

28
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,670
You said that from the time when his servant attacked Jo Ban, it was already planned by Hong In Bang.

29
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,750
Why did you think of that?
 (Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon) 

30
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:38,110
It's because from the beginning, Hong In Bang's goal has always been the Haedong Gapjok.
 (Haedong Gapjok: established families dating back to unified Silla dynasty) 

31
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,330
Hong In Bang is not that delusional.

32
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,080
In the past 700 years, there has been no politician who has attacked the Haedong Gapjok.

33
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,790
Yes. I think that Hong In Bang is now doing something that not even one politician has ever done before.

34
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,020
Say something that makes sense!

35
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,770
Tell me about why you are thinking that way.

36
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,730
Because if I were Hong In Bang, I would've done it that way.
 (Lee Bang Won) 

37
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,410
"I am Hong In Bang."

38
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,390
"What am I afraid of? What do I want?"

39
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,800
"That's right... Now, I have defeated Lee In Gyeom and have risen to the highest position of power."

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,670
"Also, I have extended my hand to the Haedong Gapjok. Marriage."

41
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,880
"It will work with marriage."

42
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,260
"But,

43
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,440
Jeong Do Jeon, Lee Bang Won... I was tricked by these people."

44
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,700
"I can never forgive myself for becoming powerless and weak."

45
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,530
"I cannot stand surrendering."

46
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,980
"Right. I will make the Haedong Gapjok kneel at my feet."

47
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:10,940
'"am Hong In Bang. I renounced my belief and survived with an evil reputation."

48
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,820
"I'm Hong In Bang..."

49
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,020
"What is the reason for not overcoming that limitation?"

50
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,850
"I will do what no one could do in the past 700 years."

51
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,040
"That is...

52
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,440
why I betrayed the Sadaebu

53
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,000
and endured having an evil reputation as a traitor."

54
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,660
"It's the reason for it."

55
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,330
This is it, Teacher.

56
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,510
What are you saying?

57
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,150
You have been transferred to a different troop starting now.

58
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,160
What?

59
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,180
Minister Hong In Bang has sent an order for me to be in charge of the interrogation.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,130
 I will put you in the position of one of the people in charge of the investigation office. 

61
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,660
 Do you want to be my dog? 

62
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:33,450
That's why the interrogation method has also changed.

63
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,510
Guys!

64
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,000
In-law, you know how much I dislike the Haedong Gapjok, right?

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,400
Even if it's like that... No, Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom also
 (Gil Tae Mi) 

66
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,510
won't touch the Haedong Gapjok.

67
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,740
Yes. That's why I'm thinking of making another order.

68
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,050
How?

69
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,480
When I first suggested the war trade to Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom,

70
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,200
you asked how we would do it when there was no more remaining land in the country, right?

71
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,430
How did I answer during that time?

72
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,260
What did you say?

73
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,270
Also, when we took in Baek Yoon's people and I raised taxes from 70% to 90%,

74
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,360
Woo Hak Joo asked how I would do it.

75
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,970
What could I have said then?

76
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,550
I'm not sure. What could you have said?

77
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,770
I said, "Just whatever."

78
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,740
You ask me how I would make another order? I'll just do whatever.

79
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,880
The methods that everyone said wouldn't work on the Haedong Gapjok and the methods they said I must not use,

80
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,900
I'll just do them.

81
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,780
I'm thinking that Bang Won is right.

82
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,200
What? Do you believe such immature words?

83
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,530
I might have underestimated Hong In Bang.

84
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,900
To solidify his power, more than you or me,

85
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,030
maybe more than the people who got their lands stolen,

86
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,320
he might be fiercely thinking and agonizing too.

87
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,850
The problem of whether or not Hong In Bang is pure and

88
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,810
and whether or not he is capable of doing it are two different problems.

89
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,010
If you think lightly of your enemy, you will definitely lose.

90
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,920
But Bang Won didn't miss that.

91
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,650
If that is true, then I dislike Bang Won even more.

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,980
How can such a young person catch on to that?
 (Nam Eun) 

93
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,420
That's because he is also having such thoughts inside.

94
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,390
I think it's ominous.

95
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,660
What do you think?

96
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,190
Do I have to give my opinion as well?

97
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,000
From the beginning, was Hong In Bang really aiming

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,470
for the strong authority of the Haedong Gapjok?

99
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,640
Strong authority?

100
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,990
Whether it's you or them, that power is fake.

101
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,320
The true power in this world
 (Lee Bang Ji) 

102
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,930
is nothing but this.

103
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,970
But if that clever word eats into one's heart, it can disguise itself to seem like power.

104
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
If Hong In Bang sees through the true nature of that power,

105
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,810
he will not only make the Haedong Gapjok his goal but also everything else.

106
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,380
 Min Je: Haedong Gapjok's Leader, nicknamed Eo Eun 

107
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,820
Have you been threatened before?

108
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,140
What? What do you mean by that?

109
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,260
You haven't been threatened before, right?

110
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,600
I came to threaten you.

111
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,490
Your joke is going overboard.

112
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,700
Jo Ban has plotted a conspiracy. And behind him

113
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,100
are Lee Seong Gye and you, the Haedong Gapjok.

114
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,190
What are you saying?

115
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,370
I was going to consult you about Lord Jo Ban's case anyway,

116
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,970
but did Jo Ban confess such lies to the investigation office?

117
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,300
Not yet, but we're expecting him to say it soon.

118
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,480
However, whether Jo Ban will only mention Lee Seong Gye

119
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,110
or even the Haedong Gapjok, will be decided by me.

120
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,010
Just why are you doing this?

121
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,100
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

122
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,520
I'm telling you to kneel in front of me.

123
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,700
I am different from any other Goryeo politician.

124
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,430
You're going to attack the Haeddong Gapjok? You're different from any other Goryeo politician?

125
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,270
How are you any different

126
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,250
that you're saying that you will do what others could not?

127
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,900
I know your power but you wouldn't know what power you have because you've never fought before,

128
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,090
since no one dared to think of messing with you.

129
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,960
The power that you have never shown in the past 700 years is just the people's trust.

130
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,690
That's everything that you have.

131
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,550
So to a person like me, who doesn't believe in that,

132
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,350
it's a useless asset.

133
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,890
If I give the order to my servants outside, this house will be smashed down,

134
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:10,370
and if I ordered you to be stripped down and inversely hanged, you can do nothing but be hanged.

135
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,230
How can you block it?

136
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,030
Do you think I can't do it? I already did it to Jo Ban.

137
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,640
This is the document you will be sending to His Highness.

138
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,490
The contents will be simple.

139
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:43,600
"Behind Jo Ban's conspiracy is Lee Seong Gye. Punish him."

140
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,430
Get every member of the Haedong Gapjok to sign this document.

141
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,450
The deadline is tomorrow morning at the hour of Myo (5-7am).

142
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,240
If this document doesn't get delivered to me by then,

143
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,300
Jo Ban and your 700-year history will come to an end.

144
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,450
Do you think I can't do it?

145
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,600
From being a Sadaebu scum and traitor, I rose to become the highest authority in the Do Dang in barely eight years. I don't care if I lose everything

146
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,950
but what you will lose is 700 years.

147
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,020
Their goal is the General?

148
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,670
He threatened the Haedong Gapjok

149
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,450
and he's making the General out to be an accomplice to this conspiracy.

150
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,050
Is he threatening not just one household or one person but the whole existence of the Haedong Gapjok?
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

151
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,990
It seems that General Choi Yeong also didn't think of that.

152
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,870
It appears that he thought that to escape danger, Hong In Bang used a trick.

153
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,890
Yes. It seems like it.

154
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,220
Threatening the Haedong Gapjok is something that no one has ever thought of and something that's unnecessary.

155
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,540
But Hong In Bang did something that no one has ever done.

156
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,000
The Haedong Gapjok never wanted conflict.

157
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,380
They are probably

158
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,060
going to to be on the side that picks a fight with them.

159
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,970
It's not impossible but I still can't make myself believe it.

160
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,980
Sam Bong. Hurry and meet Teacher Eo Eun.
 (Eo Eun is Haedon Gapjok's Leader Min Je's nickname) 

161
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,290
Someone who has never fallen in the water can drown from water that only goes up to his nose.

162
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:33,600
The Haedong Gapjok has never become a direct target of the enemy in this kind of incident.

163
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,630
I'm saying that they have never had a direct political fight before.

164
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:44,170
So as the water fills up to their noses, they will follow the stronger side.

165
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,360
That's how I will show them horror.

166
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,690
"This Hong In Bang is really a crazy bastard. You can't predict what he will really do."

167
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,290
You can't even wield a sword so how come you can see through the real nature of a battle?

168
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,940
Are you really going to attack the whole Haedong Gapjok?

169
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,500
I will make them surrender.

170
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,710
Also, my only goal is Lee Seong Gye.

171
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,720
That's right. It's Lee Seong Gye, right?

172
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,950
Then you should keep an eye on Lee Seong Gye, 
What's the point of receiving the document?

173
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,260
Observe Lee Seong Gye and make sure that he doesn't leave Gaegyeong.

174
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,940
Also report back regarding the movements of the Haedong Gapjok tonight.

175
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,300
Yes. I will do that.

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,470
 This case can decide the fate of the Bi Guk Temple. 

177
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,170
 From here on, I have to make the right judgement. 

178
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:51,720
Can that man really grab ahold of Goryeo?
 (Jeok Ryong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk) 

179
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,500
Or is that his final flame before he disappears?

180
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,870
Haedong Gapjok...

181
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,320
Eat.

182
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,540
It's been a while since I've had a meal that you prepared.

183
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,880
You're going around eating your meals, right?

184
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,550
Why is it that  from when we were young, you only worried about whether I ate my meals or not?

185
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,040
It's not that.
 (Boon Yi) 

186
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,260
I also worried about whether or not you're getting tricked or being beaten up somewhere.

187
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,030
I didn't even know that you became the Viper.

188
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,550
That's why, from now on, don't act up and just worry about yourself.

189
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,450
But how did you get into this place?

190
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,240
How did you know that man?

191
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,450
- That man?
- Lee Bang Won. That guy.

192
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,130
That guy doesn't seem like someone who would work for this cause.

193
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,800
No. He's doing it with us. Plus he's smart.

194
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,560
He saved me a few times.

195
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,070
Really?

196
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,590
He also helped us when we were young.

197
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,720
Well, he did help us.

198
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,130
Eat more.

199
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,220
Teacher Sam Bong is looking for you. It seems that he's going to Lord Min Je's house.

200
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,480
I understand.

201
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,170
Be careful.

202
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,570
Just why... Did Hong In Bang really demand this of us?

203
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,770
We need to discuss this with the whole Haedong Gapjok. We have until tomorrow morning.

204
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,850
I understand.

205
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,750
Secretly contact everyone.

206
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,430
The elder has gone far away on a vacation.

207
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,140
Then, when is he coming back?

208
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:05,110
He went and didn't say exactly when he's coming back.

209
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,460
 Hong In Bang came and left two hours ago, and members of the Haedong Gapjok who are in Gaegyeong came in an hour ago. 

210
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,280
 Teacher Eo Eun is inside. Pass it on to Bon Won. 

211
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,710
Hong In Bang met Min Je. After that, Min Je called and gathered the members of the Haedong Gapjok who are in Gaegyeong.

212
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,590
I think they will have a meeting by tonight.

213
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,090
The direction of power will be decided tonight.
 (Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan's Owner) 

214
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,960
Disperse the girls and report everything about Minister Hong and the Haedong Gapjok's movements

215
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,910
and General Lee Seong Gye and General Choi Yeong's movements as well.

216
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,520
Yes.

217
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,060
Teacher Eo Eun is inside and Hong In Bang came and left two hours ago.

218
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,140
Twin Dragons of the East 22nd move!

219
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,890
I trusted you from the start. You were not ordinary.

220
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,950
It's only because this kid, Moo Hyul, said something about you being a swindler and...

221
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,840
That damn swindler, swindler, swindler!

222
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,350
Aigoâ€”
 (Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's grandmother) 

223
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,950
You don't have to get that mad when you also tricked us before.

224
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,820
Where is Young Master Bang Won?

225
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,090
Oh,in there. There. What was it, that...

226
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,570
They said a new weapon came so they went that way to look at it.

227
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,940
Thank you.

228
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,100
Inside this is something that's called gunpowder.

229
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,430
It's something that General Choi Mu Seon has made.
 (Choi Mu Seon: the one who introduced gunpowder and weapons using it to Goryeo) 

230
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,330
Wow... I saw what was inside but I didn't know it was like this.

231
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,530
So that we can use it to defeat Japanese pirates, General Choi Yeong

232
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,190
directed us to create a gunpowder troop in the Ga Byeol Cho.

233
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,650
A gunpowder troop?

234
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,600
Uncle, you're not scared, right?

235
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,420
Hey, hey. If we use a weapon like this,

236
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,160
what would people like us, who ride horses and fight with a sword, do?

237
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,980
Before it could catch Japanese pirates, the horses would faint and fall down.

238
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,510
The times will change from here on.
 (Lee Bang Woo) 

239
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,950
Handle the gunpowder well.

240
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,820
Young Master Bang Won. Just a second.

241
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,420
Hong In Bang did it to Lord Min Je? It's going as we expected.

242
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,610
He said that we need to find out what the two of them talked about.

243
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,730
You said he won't see us, right?

244
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,270
How do we find out?

245
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,890
Why?

246
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,510
Are you stupid?

247
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,740
What?

248
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,040
You're Lord Min Je's son-in-law.

249
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,650
You became allied to him by marriage.

250
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,340
We're not allied yet.

251
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:50,510
The Min family of Hwang Ryeo is thinking of abandoning their daughter if things become disadvantageous for them.

252
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,920
They won't cooperate with me in this kind of situation.

253
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,560
If we want to find something out, I need to cooperate with my wife

254
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,070
but I don't have anything to offer.

255
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,860
Why are you laughing?

256
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,240
I thought you were the only one like that,

257
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,950
but it seems that she's the same as you.

258
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,990
Try doing what you're good at.

259
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,050
What I'm good at?

260
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,800
"I am Hong In Bang."

261
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,480
Don't just think like that but think as if you are Lady Da Kyung.

262
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,820
If you are her, what would you desire the most? What would make you act?

263
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,620
Thinking about that.

264
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,790
In my opinion, she's the same as you.

265
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,510
We decided to gather and discuss it tonight.

266
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,340
The possibility of everyone taking Hong In Bang's side is high.

267
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,870
So if we come to the decision of signing our names on the document...

268
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,810
General Lee Seong Gye will be attacked immediately.

269
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,230
It's an urgent matter.

270
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,010
We don't have time.

271
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,200
 Da Kyung, if we decide to go to that side, I will send someone 

272
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,780
 so be prepared to leave that house immediately.
(Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeong) 

273
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,070
I heard you went to your parents' house.

274
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,390
Did Father-in-law

275
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,810
say that he will at least send someone if our situation becomes bad?

276
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,290
Yes. Because I have to escape.

277
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes. You'd have to do that.

278
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,180
I don't resent you even a little bit

279
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,440
because it's a political marriage to the Lee family.

280
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,540
For thinking that way, I give you thanks as a representative of my family.

281
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,610
But if you don't feel resentment, why were you waiting for me?

282
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,090
For the last time,

283
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,310
let's make a deal.

284
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,830
My wise and objective wife,

285
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,220
if you chose me and my family, in the end

286
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,830
it would be because you think that things will eventually turn to our side.

287
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:33,040
But right now, Hong In Bang will be meeting the Haedong Gapjok and will be joining hands with them.

288
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,760
That is thinking that the Haedong Gapjok is almost going over to Hong In Bang.

289
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,480
That's because the person of highest power in the Do Dang is Hong In Bang.

290
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,680
And so?

291
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,560
So,

292
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,220
I will turn the tables and

293
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,490
will ask for a final deal with you.

294
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,090
What is it that you want?

295
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,950
Everything

296
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,730
that you heard from Father-in-law today.

297
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,040
You can just tell me that.

298
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,000
Then, what are you going to give me?

299
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,780
Didn't you say it was a deal?

300
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,360
It is

301
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,710
my family's biggest secret.

302
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,800
If things go wrong,

303
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,690
it can be the safest way to protect the Min family of Hwang Ryeo.

304
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,420
What will you do?

305
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,500
Okay. What should I do?

306
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,120
Write here your own promise

307
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,650
and let's exchange it immediately.

308
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,110
Look here, Wife.

309
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,690
How is it that you didn't write anything?

310
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,950
Is this true?

311
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,930
That's right. It is true.

312
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,260
Even telling me about this,

313
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,050
do you trust me that much?

314
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,250
I don't trust you.

315
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,480
Then why? Telling this kind of secret to me?

316
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,640
Because you're part of the Haedong Gapjok.

317
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,000
I thought that

318
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,420
the Haedong Gapjok wouldn't be surprised at something like this

319
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,390
but you were surprised.

320
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,680
If I tell you everything that I know,

321
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,480
do you have a way to put this situation back the way it was?

322
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,840
Whether I have a way or not, whether I succeed or fail,

323
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,070
the Min family of Hwang Ryeo will not lose anything.

324
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,760
Tell me.

325
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,240
I got it.

326
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,610
I found out about what Hong In Bang demanded from the Haedong Gapjok.

327
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,980
Then, what is it?

328
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,100
It's a document signed by all members of the Haedong Gapjok

329
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,490
saying that the one behind Jo Ban's conspiracy is you, Father...

330
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,360
If the Haedong Gaapjok sign the document tonight,

331
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,790
it will be delivered to Hong In Bang tomorrow morning.

332
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,390
And if it gets to the King, an arrest warrant for you will be immediately be issued, Father.

333
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,750
We don't have time.

334
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:46,930
For what reason would the Haedong Gapjok sign a document like that?

335
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,630
What?

336
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,470
Is that true?

337
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,140
Would I come here at this time of the night to inform you of a lie?

338
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,580
Looks like i raised a monster.

339
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,220
It has already started.

340
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,790
If I fail, you will not be safe either, Hap Ha.

341
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,880
For what reason
 (Lee In Gyeom) 

342
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,330
are you telling me this?

343
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,720
The problem is Choi Yeong.

344
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,880
So that General Choi Yeong won't have other thoughts,

345
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,230
I trust you to enforce it well.

346
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,170
First, you'll have to leave Gaegyeong.

347
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,670
Did you just say leave?

348
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,630
If the Haedong Gapjok signs the petition and Hong In Bang takes it to the king,

349
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,940
the king will not be able to reject it and he will issue the order.

350
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,220
Then, with that, everything will end.

351
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,810
So, General, please help the master escape.

352
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,140
Are you telling me to ran away?

353
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,790
It's not running away but retreating.

354
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,680
For what reason do we have to retreat?

355
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:57,000
Hyung-nim, in this late night, let's go and pull the heads off those bastards.
 (Lee Ji Ran) 

356
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,750
That won't do.

357
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,680
We are good at fighting so why are you saying it won't do?

358
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,990
We don't have a reason for it now.

359
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,420
Without reason, if we attack Goryeo's political figures, Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi,

360
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,440
that will then become treason.

361
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,670
Sam Bong...

362
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,650
Did you say that we don't have a reason?

363
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,760
Then make a reason for us.

364
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,200
Spit out a plan.

365
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,810
Then... We only have General Choi Yeong.

366
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,960
Since there is no evidence, this is definitely a conspiracy fabricated by Hong In Bang.

367
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:51,440
If General Choi Yeong decides, Hong In  Bang and Gil Tae Mi can be arrested in a day.

368
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,000
But we don't know how much time it will take for this plan to succeed or fail.

369
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,770
I will make time.

370
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,460
I found out where the Haedong Gapjok gathering is being held.

371
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,960
I will make time so that those people will not be able to sign the petition.

372
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,240
Bang Won.

373
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,510
Yes, Teacher.

374
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,070
How will you make time?

375
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,930
I will make it no matter what method I use.

376
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,530
Are you really going to make time?

377
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,570
Are you not thinking of doing something else?

378
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,700
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

379
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,430
If you think you're sure of something, you don't ask other people about it.

380
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,790
Whenever you're confident of something but don't ask others about it, it then becomes trouble.

381
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,380
If I guessed it right, you are confident of doing something again.

382
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,910
Right?

383
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,600
I'm sorry.

384
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,130
You are right.

385
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,580
Actually, I'm thinking of the same thing...

386
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,810
Teacher!

387
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:25,220
"A bigger wave can beat a big wave." Something like that.

388
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,760
Is that right?

389
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,950
Yes. That's right, Teacher.

390
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,960
Do it as you please.

391
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,930
Thank you, Teacher.

392
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,180
I will surely succeed.

393
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,760
 The one behind Jo Ban's conspiracy is Lee Seong Gye?
 (Choi Yeong)  

394
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,120
 Nothing's confirmed yet. 

395
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,890
 But Hong In Bang wants to arrest Lee Seong Gye and  interrogate him by the King's order. 

396
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,900
 That's nonsense! 

397
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,180
 Indeed, it doesn't make sense. 

398
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,410
 But Hong In Bang already has evidence against Jo Ban 

399
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,690
 and he also gained the support of the Haedong Gapjok. 

400
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,990
 Haedong Gapjok? 

401
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,060
 No... Are you saying that those people are supporting Hong In Bang? 

402
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,510
 Yes. 

403
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,680
 I raised a monster. I have sinned. 

404
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:36,320
 If the Haedong Gapjok helps Hong In Bang in this case, 

405
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,890
 His Highness will definitely have Lee Seong Gye arrested. 

406
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:46,570
 If the Haedong Gapjok steps forward, His Highness will not be able to say no. 

407
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,120
 Teacher Po Eun and General Lee Seong Gye are here. 

408
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,080
Let them in.

409
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,660
Aigoo... I'm not someone who should be doing this here.

410
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,790
Where are you going to move this gunpowder to?
 (Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master) 

411
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:14,330
Ah, this is not gunpowder. They're empty containers. These are leftovers after organizing the gunpowder.

412
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,170
How much gunpowder is inside the storage?

413
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,590
Well, there's about 200 geun (120 kg).

414
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,880
I will just take one of these.

415
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,600
Ah, that... This iss gunpowder! This! It explodes!

416
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,140
It's not something that you eat!

417
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,350
Why did he take it?

418
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:53,210
 That's right, Lee Bang Won. Let's do it. 

419
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:11,940


420
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,190
Well...

421
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,560
Can you help me?

422
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,630
With what?

423
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,750
If you go to the storage, there will be two boxes on top of a table. Please get me one of those.

424
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,620
Which one between the two?

425
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,090
Just... whichever.

426
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,040
You can just go and carry it. Why did you ask me to do it?

427
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,380
Thank you.

428
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,880
- Is that everything?
- Yes.

429
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,750
 Boon, you must have picked this without knowing what it is, 

430
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,170
 but your choice will decide whether we live or die. 

431
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,440
 Are these stones or gunpowder? 

432
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,780
 Tonight's fate is hanging by a thread. 

433
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,980
Hey, Gil Tae Mi! Are you the best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms?

434
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,750
Take your sword and let's battle it out!

435
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,580
Ah, this is lame. There must be a cooler line than this...

436
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,180
 Moo Hyul 

437
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,600
Are you Minister Gil Tae Mi?

438
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,080
Then,

439
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,670
that will do.
 (His parody of what Ddang Sae said when he killed Baek Yoon) 

440
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,840
Done! That will do! Ah, this one's cool!

441
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,800
Ah, this will work!

442
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,050
He said it will work. What should we do? That one's not normal either.
 (Jo Young Gyu) 

443
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,090
Aigoo...

444
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,630
Young Master!

445
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,610
Y-Young Master! Why are you carrying that? That's dangerous!

446
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,880
How many Ga Byeol Cho soldiers can be mobilized right away?
 (Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's private army) 

447
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Why are you being like that?

448
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:40,690
Order them to secretly and separately get out of the capital and assemble in front of Sung Wi Gate in about an hour.

449
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,770
 Finally going to fight! It's a chance to earn merits. 

450
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,800
Yes. I understand.

451
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,940
Yes.

452
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:59,720
Also, Lee Seong Gye, official of the Northeast will be interrogated as the one who controlled Jo Ban.

453
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:07,000
Following the gravity of that offense, we earnestly want him punished.

454
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:30,410
It's really hard for me to relay such words to you.

455
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:38,520
But the deadline that Hong In Bang gave us is only until this morning in the hour of Myo (5-7am). We don't have much time left.

456
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,210
As I said, if we reject this,

457
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,610
Hong In Bang will target us as the ones behind Jo Ban and we'll be investigated.

458
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,620
If everyone will cast their vote,

459
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:02,920
I will immediately pass the result on to Hong In Bang.

460
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,590
What do you want to do?

461
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:20,670
If, you want to fight with this rude and violent man of power,

462
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,070
I will follow your decision and use Sam Bong as the spearhead.

463
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:38,750
 A decision has been made already. We will not fight anyone. 

464
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:45,440
 This is the powerless side of Haedong Gapjok who has never gotten into a fight. 

465
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,330
Let's sign our names.

466
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,590
What is the problem?

467
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:55,950
We can just turn our heads away for a bit and soon the world will go back to the way it was.

468
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,720
Let's not ask for trouble. How long will Hong In Bang last anyway?

469
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,890
We just need to look away until then.

470
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,340
How would you know that Hong In Bang won't last long?

471
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,580
Even if he lasts long, it would only be 30 years. Until what age do you think he will live?

472
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,760
Is 30 years a short time?

473
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,140
We have 700 years. History is the proof of that.

474
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,960
All the people of power have come and has gone but we will last forever, like the public.

475
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,390
Compared to forever, 30 years is nothing more than a short time.

476
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,830
Yes. That's good. Let's do it like that.

477
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,140
I also agree.

478
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,270
I agree.

479
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,250
I agree.

480
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,650
- I also agree.
- I agree.

481
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,440
- I agree.
- I do agree.

482
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,010
Yes, then let's do that.

483
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,310
Let's sign our names.

484
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,360
Who are you?

485
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,310
Who are you?

486
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,110
No, you! Why are you...

487
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:41,910


488
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,640
This

489
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,590
is gunpowder.

490
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,840
Gunpowder?

491
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Did he say gunpowder?

492
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,110
 Gunpowder? 

493
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:19,110
 Lee Bang Won? How did he... 

494
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,800
What are you doing?

495
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,750
Until I finish what I have to say, nobody can leave this place.

496
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,750
If someone tries to leave, cut off his head. Do you understand?

497
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,620
Yes!

498
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,640
Gunpowder?

499
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,340
Ah, yes. About that... Young Master Bang Won

500
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,140
took a box of gunpowder and left with the Ga Byeol Cho soldiers.

501
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,760
But, where is he going while carrying such a dangerous thing?

502
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,910
I also don't know about that.

503
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,510
Gunpowder? Is that dangerous?

504
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,020
What kind of powder is it?

505
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,180
You're being ignorant. It's not something that you eat but... BBANG!

506
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,540
It's a powder that explodes.

507
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,690
Just what is he going to do?

508
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,140
But that... I don't know what kind of powder that is,

509
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,520
but is it a powder that can explode his heart?

510
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,920
Looking at his face, I think it already exploded. Bang!

511
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,380
Bang Won took some gunpowder and left.

512
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,240
Gunpowder?

513
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,900
Yes. He took Ga Byeol Cho soldiers with him.

514
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,680
It is something that I'm aware of.

515
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,020
You knew about it?

516
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,550
But I didn't know he would bring gunpowder with him.

517
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,270
What?

518
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,440
 Young Master, can you really do this? 

519
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:07,840
If it goes according to this document, then my family will end now.

520
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:16,320
In his lifetime, he fought off invasions from Japanese pirates and Red Turbans. This General who dedicated his life to this

521
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,820
is now accused of revolting.

522
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,850
He will be sentenced to die.

523
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:34,370
Well, what's the big deal with something like that in Goryeo?

524
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:44,150
Another name will be added to the list of injustice and corruption in this country

525
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,420
and it will just pass like that.

526
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,080
What do you want to say?

527
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:55,410
Also, the families of the Haedong Gapjok present here, without being concerned, can just enjoy it to your hearts' content like always

528
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,500
and it will also pass like that.

529
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,470
What do you know about the Haedong Gapjok for you to just thoughtlessly say that?

530
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,180
I know as much as I needed to know.

531
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,380
The whole nation was set on fire because of the Mongol invasion.

532
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,090
During the 30 years when the people faced cruel deaths,

533
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,190
your families stayed on Ganghwa Island

534
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,960
and held exhibitions of poems and paintings in the valley every day, right?

535
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,770
Yes.

536
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:34,100
Of course, your hearts must be in pain because of the horrible reality of this Goryeo.

537
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:40,760
So you boasted to each other about your talent for poetry

538
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,370
and wrote a lot of poems about the people who have fallen into poor and distressing situations.

539
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,110
Other than that,

540
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,050
besides that,

541
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,550
what else did you do during the past 700 years?

542
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:08,440
In the 700 years, you just sat and watched history.

543
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,380
You never attacked anyone and just enjoyed what you have.

544
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,260
That

545
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,110
is Haedong Gapjok.

546
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,010
You bastard! You are beyond disrespectful.

547
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,410
You dare to come to a Haedong Gapjok meeting

548
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,970
do wicked things and hope to get out of here alive?

549
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,430
That's a good question.

550
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,960
Yes. I want to come out of here alive.

551
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,770
What?

552
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,520
Just a day ago,

553
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,330
I had never even imagined that I would be doing something like this to you.

554
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:55,310
But why am I doing this to you now?

555
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:05,070
It's because I found out that the Haedong Gapjok is going to surrender to Hong In Bang.

556
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:13,270
Okay, should I now tell you about Haedong Gapjok's future?

557
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:20,510
From  here on, politicians who get caught by the authority in this land

558
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:25,140
will threaten and use you the way Hong In Bang did.

559
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,770
They will make you kneel down.

560
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:36,470
Every time that happens, you will all surrender.

561
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,850
"Let's just lose." Do you avoid crap because it's scary?

562
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:46,700
"Let's not cause trouble."

563
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:52,180
Like tonight, you'll probably just nod your heads powerlessly.

564
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:57,360
That is, unlike the past 700 years,

565
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,240
what will be recorded for the next 700 years.

566
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,660
Do you really want to create a history of insult and humiliation for yourselves?

567
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:19,190
Or by signing your names in this document,

568
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:26,140
treating today's humiliation as if it never happened, and coming out with the Haedong Gapjok's bright history

569
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,630
are you trying to grasp onto your final chance?

570
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,710
How?

571
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,710
"Administrators of the Do Dang Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi

572
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,310
are behind Lee In Gyeom's impeachment."

573
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,520
"They forcibly took lands from many people including Jo Ban

574
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,500
and habitually meddled with the Do Dang by buying and selling government positions."

575
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,620
"They schemed to expose Jo Ban's conspiracy as if it was true and interfered with the country."

576
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:16,260
"Please make them pay for that crime."

577
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,260
Please sign your names to this document.

578
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,750
With us, let's make those three people pay.

579
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,280
Let's turn back today's disgrace as if it never happened.

580
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,680
What if we don't do it?

581
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,940
If we don't do it, what will you do?

582
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,760
You will do it.

583
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,790
But we don't have a lot of time.

584
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:56,240
So I'm going to help you come to that conclusion.

585
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,710
What are you doing?

586
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,210
Hurry and cut the wick!

587
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,750
Once all of you sign your names on this document, I will cut the wick.

588
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,870
If you don't,

589
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,520
you will disappear from this place with me.

590
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:51,070
We will sign the document. We will sign it! Cut the wick first!

591
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,820
The signatures come first.

592
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,460
I-It's not because I'm afraid of the gunpowder.

593
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,120
It's because I agree with what you say.

594
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,150
That Bang Won guy is dangerous! What did you tell him to do?

595
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:41,360
In this desperate situation, that child's ominous instinct that you're talking about...

596
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,540
I believe that it is the thing that can save us now.

597
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,210
Father-in-law.

598
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,270
Is that really gunpowder?

599
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:17,860
If you're suspicious, wait until it explodes.

600
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,460
Teacher Eo Eun! Hurry and sign your name!

601
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,310
Teacher will surely sign it.

602
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:31,310
Hurry and cut the wick first.

603
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,020
What if that gunpowder is fake and this guy is just bluffing?

604
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,840
Are you going to bet your life that I am just bluffing, Father-in-law?

605
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,000
 Boon... Boon Yi... 

606
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,800
Don't you see it?

607
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,250
Young Master is also shaking right now. This person is not someone who would lie.

608
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,760
Are you thinking of killing everyone in here?

609
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:28,400
I am just moved by everyone's wise choice.

610
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,570
I will definitely dispel those three people of the Do Dang

611
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,100
and I will repay you with kindness for your choice.

612
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:08,310
You were surely scared, like me, and even your pupils were shaking.

613
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:13,500
Just how... Did you also do that on purpose?

614
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,780
Is that even possible?

615
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,270
I also didn't know if it was the gunpowder or stones.

616
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:26,610
But to fool you elders, I needed to fool myself as well.

617
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,700
I also needed to be scared.

618
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,310
Even so, it's gunpowder, right?

619
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,650
How can you give a dangerous thing to a dangerous person?

620
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:10,340
That... is not gunpowder.

621
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,270
It wasn't?

622
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:17,840
Earlier, Bang Won desperately came to me

623
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,050
and asked me to choose between two boxes in the storage room.

624
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:28,960
But when I opened them, one was filled with stones while the other one has gunpowder in it.

625
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,230
So?

626
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:34,890
So I gave him the one with stones.

627
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,340
Why?

628
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:43,050
I didn't know what he was going to do but I had a feeling.

629
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:47,190
I also thought that gunpowder is dangerous.

630
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:58,230
But can we really do this? Can we really threaten those amazing people back there?

631
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,930
Nobody among them would think that they signed it because they were threatened.

632
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,530
Why?

633
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,600
"I, of the Hwang Ryeo Min Family, did not surrender to a trivial thing like gunpowder.

634
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,770
I signed it for the right cause." That's how they will rationalize it.

635
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:19,720
That is a way to cover up their shame and humiliation.

636
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,940
 He's really amazing! 

637
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,390
- Young Gyu.
- Yes.

638
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:26,540
Hide those people and protect them from Hong In Bang.

639
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,740
Yes, Young Master!

640
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,470
Moo Hyul, follow me.

641
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:32,210
Yes, Young Master.

642
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,960
 This is bad. I need to hurry and tell Minister Hong In Bang about this. 

643
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,390
 I need to report this to Hwa Sa Dan immediately. 

644
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,640
Young Master, it's curfew hours. (9-11pm)

645
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,440
It will be morning soon.

646
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,600
 Hong In Bang, it will be your last morning. 

647
00:58:54,190 --> 00:59:04,520


648
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,170
 Six Flying Dragons 

649
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,180
 - What happened?
- I got all the signatures of the Haedong Gapjok. 

650
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,800
 That's right, Hong In Bang. This is the end. 

651
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,090
 I got the order from His Highness! A warrant of arrest has been issued. 

652
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,660
 Our targets are Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi, and Lee In Gyeom. 

653
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,570
 This means that In-law failed... 

654
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,930
 Damn it... Fine, I'll just kill them all. 

655
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,980
 The important thing is catching Gil Tae Mi using overwhelming military force. 

656
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,050
 We must catch him immediately. 

657
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,110
 Arrest everyone and take them to the investigation office! 

658
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,590
 No, this can't happen... This can't be... 

659
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:41,800
 It's here! The traitor Hong In Bang is here! 

660
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,820
 Arrest Hong In Bang! 

661
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,100
 Hey! Lee In Gyeom's Doormat!
