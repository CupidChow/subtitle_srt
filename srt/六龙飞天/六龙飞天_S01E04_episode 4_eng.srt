1
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,290
What's wrong with this? Why is this suddenly... This is the first for something like this.

2
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,240
First?

3
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,320
From now on, it's the start.

4
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,880
 Goodness is something that will even accept and embrace evil. 

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,110
 But justice will never tolerate evil. 

6
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:33,080
 Only by purging evil, will justice be 

7
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,260
righteous.

8
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,090
 It can't be. Did that child really... 

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,850
 Episode 4 
What are you doing here this late at night?

10
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,730
Was it you?

11
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,490
That night, was it your doing?

12
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,170
That night, was it you, teacher, that left Colleague Heo Gang's piece of clothing?

13
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,450
You do still call me teacher.

14
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,870
Whether it be goodness or evil, I still received your teachings.

15
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,330
That night, teacher, you performed an act of evil, while I performed an act of justice.

16
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,730
Justice... You think that's justice?

17
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,340
If the world adopts your way of justice, it will be so horrendous.

18
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,150
It's not something to be hearing from an evil man, but I guess it will be so.

19
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,890
Yes. Right now I'm still lacking.

20
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,270
Let's just say I'm still in the process of learning justice. Since I'm... young.

21
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:58,990
Yes. Regardless of whether I'm an evil man, we have something in common.

22
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,650
Yes.

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,500
Now at least...

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,930
 You have to continue to be virtuous. 

25
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,590
 The General and his son as well. 

26
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,270
Neither of us is good-hearted.

27
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,160
  Until I gather more power, I will never be good-hearted.    

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,710
  I've already seen goodness without power.    

29
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,940
  Ddang Sae (Later Lee Bang Ji)    

30
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,880
 There was a bodyguard protecting Princess No Gook. 

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,960
 The Princess would always take him and Yeon Hyang, with her. 

32
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,630
 It is Gil Sun Mi. 

33
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,310
 He is the twin brother of Gil Tae Mi, who is currently the Ji Mun Ha Boo Sa (name of a political position). 

34
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,890
 It's been said that he sometimes visits the temple of Chung Ak mountain. 

35
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,670
Is that child really looking for Gil Sun Mi?

36
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,770
But, why is that kid looking for him ?

37
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,210
 The symbol in this letter! The person with this symbol took our mom away. 

38
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,730
He knows our symbol.

39
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,690
What? What are you saying?

40
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,120
There is someone else who is also looking for Gil Sun Mi.

41
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,240
Some old guy came and looked for Gil Sun Mi about a month ago.

42
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,830
Now he's set up a camp down by the stream and is waiting.

43
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,860
Oh... Gil Sun Mi isn't here?

44
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:59,090
He comes by from time to time, but you can't tell if that will be today or tomorrow.

45

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

46
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,550
You know this right?
I'm curious about how you know about this.

47
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,890
How did you come to know this symbol?

48
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,670
My mother... My mother was taken by him.

49
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,930
That ajussi had that tattoo.

50
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,470
You guys are in the same gang right? Where is my mother?

51
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,090
Who is your mother?

52
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,760
Yeon Hyang. They say that my mother was once a palace maid called Yeon Hyang.

53
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,990
Who did you say? Yeon Hyang?

54
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,930
Yes.

55
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,420
Save me, please save me.

56
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,440
Gil Sun Mi.

57
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,680
 He's Gil Sun Mi? 

58
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,410
Are you okay?

59
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm so thankful.

60
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,170
But you really look exactly like Gil Tae Mi.

61
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,610
Aside from looking exactly the same, we are totally different.

62
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,680
As expected of Gil Sun Mi.

63
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,310
I can feel his presence even under this cliff.

64
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,900
What did you say?

65
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,880
I am palace maid Yeon Hyang's son.

66
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,890
How can this be...

67
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,560
What I'm about to say right now, keep it in mind.

68
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,460
From today till the day you die, you must not have any interest in your mother.

69
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,510
You must never say the name Yeon Hyang.

70
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,160
Why not?

71
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,390
Your mother is a great traitor against Goryeo.

72
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,520
What?

73
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,580
Because of a mistake your mother made, Princess No Gook died.

74
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,940
Don't try to learn anything else. Just forget it and live.

75
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,170
Is she... even alive?

76
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,170
I don't know, but

77
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:15,260
if you continue to search for your mother, you will die.

78
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:21,120
It will bring a calamity not only to your mother, but to you and all your family.

79
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,130
Everyone will die!

80
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,350
Why? What did we do wrong?

81
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,630
What did my mother do to deserve that?

82
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,990
Is that why those people were trying to kill me?

83
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,580
What? Those people weren't just robbers?

84
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,780
They followed you because they knew about your situation and name?

85
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,720
Yes! They were chasing me.

86
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,100
I told them my name and everything.

87
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,960
You're

88
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,020
already in danger.

89
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,000
  By looking for mother, she and Boon Yi are going to die?    

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,600
What am I supposed to do with this child, Yeon Hyang?

91
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,550
Your swordsmanship is on par with your best-swordsman-in-the-three-kingdoms brother, Gil Tae Mi.

92
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,090
I don't recognize your face. Who are you?

93
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,880
I've come from afar to look for my disciple and I'm...

94
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,650
Seriously?

95
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:43,270
Since we've sparred, it should be believable. Is it not?

96
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,100
Oh no. I give my greetings to my senior.

97
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,990
I'm Gil Sun Mi.

98
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,540
By any chance, do you know this person?

99
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,200
Who is this?

100
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,070
He is my disciple. He came into Goryeo, dueled with someone, and died.

101
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,350
So I suspected your brother and you. But it does not seem so.

102
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,590
If it was a fair duel, then that is just a consequence of being a warrior.

103
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,450
Why are you chasing him with a petty grudge?

104
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,400
It's not to get revenge.

105
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,760
It's just because I'm curious.

106
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,000
 I was told that his sword was so fast that without even trading many hits, in one strike, 

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,040
 he (the disciple) lost his life, unable to even scream. 

108
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,590
If you are truly the owner of the name that I know,

109
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,180
I heard that you would put your life on repaying one's kindness and keeping a promise.

110
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,390
Of course. Why do you ask?

111
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,960
I think I have an idea who the person your disciple dueled with is.

112
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,000
If I tell you about that, will you listen to my request?

113
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,990
Really. Do you really know who it is?

114
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,130
Will you promise me?

115
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,120
Of course. Tell me. Who is he exactly?

116
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,160
Cheok Sa Gwang

117
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,230
Cheok Sa Gwang?

118
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,970
Do you know the name Cheok Joon Gyung?

119
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:21,410
Of course I do. Even though I came from China, how would one that practices martial arts not know who he is?

120
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,500
Cheok Joon Gyung's Gok San sword art was passed down to his descendants,

121
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,570
and by the fourth generation descendants, that sword art was revived.

122
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,950
That descendant Cheok Sa Gwang disappeared after killing a master in China.

123
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,760
It is only a rumor among warriors, but

124
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,860
I think there is a good chance of it being true.

125
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,360
Thank you so much.

126
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,490
But what was the request you were going to make?

127
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,580
That kid, please take care of him.

128
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,560
Take care of him?

129
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,660
Just for today?

130
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,010
Then, maybe like a month?

131
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,360
Please protect him until he is safe.

132
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,980
Or until he becomes an adult.

133
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,520
I can trust your name, right?

134
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,230
Hey, I'm someone who keeps his promises, but

135
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,800
I don't really have the time to stay in Goryeo for too long.

136
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,640
So, there are two methods.

137
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,150
First option. Learn martial arts from me.

138
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,580
Then you can protect yourself.

139
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,690
I've no interest in that.

140
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,250
Then how in the world am I going to protect you forever?

141
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,650
I have to return in three years.

142
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,090
Ugh. Why did I even bring up my name?

143
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,450
What kind of kid doesn't understand what I'm trying to tell him?

144
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,510
Sigh. Just my luck.

145
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,640
Eh? No this can't be.

146
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,210
I have to keep my promise.

147
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
  Moo Hyul

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

149
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,340
Yes!!

150
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,110
This is a troubling age...

151
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,650
It's been a troubling age since I was born...

152
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,510
It's getting even more troubling.

153
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,670
Well that's because of the Mongols, the Red Turbans, and the Japanese.

154
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,450
Father and Mother passed way in the midst of it all.

155
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,010
That's why I've come to a conclusion.

156
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,370
Moo Hyul, you need to learn martial arts.

157
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,600
Martial arts?

158
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,150
You've heard of the Gil Tae Mi brothers right? They had nothing,

159
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,500
but with just one sword, now they are living life while farting (living in luxury).

160
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,440
Yes.

161
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,110
That is it.

162
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,510
Other than this, there is no way that all eleven of us can live in these troubling times.

163
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:23,180
But he's only strong. He can't even hold a kitchen knife.

164
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,980
That's why we need that pig.

165
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,010
There's something that I heard.

166
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,830
So take everything you guys have and meet in the front yard. 
  ( Myo Sang, Moo Hyul's Grandmother)    

167
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,860
If you hide anything to eat by yourself, you'll be kicked out of this house!

168
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,140
Master!!

169
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,580
We respect you, Master!

170
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,010
Master Hong, you... Former best-swordsman-in-the-three-kingdoms Hong Yoon...

171
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,710
Current best-swordsman-in-the-three-kingdoms Gil Tae Mi...

172
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,860
And Gil Sun Mi, who is on equal footing with Gil Tae Mi...

173
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,330
I heard you taught all of them.

174
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,990
I thought I said not to spread the word. Who... Darn it.

175
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,010
Please turn our Moo Hyul into one of them too.

176
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,970
When he was ten, he used to grab the horn of an ox and pull it.

177
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,380
I am trying to turn my back on swords.

178
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,150
If I were to take in a student again...

179
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,530
Please accept him.

180
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,220
If you would only accept him, the ten of us will

181
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,940
give you anything.

182
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,610
Ha! What to do...

183
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,710
Hey. This...and this Who's going to eat these?

184
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,700
And this black thing. The black beans. Th-This. Take them away.

185
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,100
Thank you. Thank you.

186
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Those had been taken from my little siblings so...

187
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,170
And, if only white rice...

188
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,710
No! No matter what, it's not happening.

189
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,310
White rice!

190
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,690
White rice. Okay, I'll bring it to you.

191
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,550
    
 So please accept... 

192
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,070
  Just one word. Just say one word.  

193
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,490
Fine. Every morning, let's learn how to divide up strength by collecting water and wood.

194
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,090
That means—

195
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,920
Okay, what is your name? 
   (Master Hong, Moo Hyul's teacher)  

196
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,140
I'm Moo Hyul.

197
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,860
  Yanggwang-do, Western District Deokjinhyeon 

198
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,620
  If you suddenly disappeared like that  

199
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,840
  did you think I would wait forever for you, Mom?  

200
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,340
I'm not going to wait for you. I'm not going to. 
   Boon Yi  

201
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,220
If brother also...

202
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,400
Brother also...

203
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,800
does not come back soon, I'm just going to have a memorial ceremony for both of you.

204
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,700
Boon Yi.

205
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,420
Brother.

206
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:50,380
Brother, why did you come so late?

207
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,100
Why did you come so late?

208
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,600
Do you know how much I waited for you?

209
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,130
I'm sorry.

210
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,120
I'm sorry, Boon. It's my fault, my fault.

211
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,930
What about Mom? What happened to Mom?

212
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,650
I... think I made a mistake.

213
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,390
I think Mother has passed away already.

214
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,870
What did I tell you? Mother...

215
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,990
I was told that the day Mom left should be set as the anniversary date of her death.

216
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,200
Okay, okay. You did well.

217
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,560
Boon Yi.

218
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,830
Yeon Hee Unni.

219
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,690
Brother is back, Brother is back.

220
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,380
  Yeon Hee  

221
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,750
  Not only your mother,  

222
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,760
  but you and your whole family will suffer calamity.  

223
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,790
 All of you will die. 

224
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,890
 She is Goryeo's traitor. 

225
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,520
 You will end up dying. 

226
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,670
 Goryeo's traitor. 

227
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:25,050
 Why did you prepare so much? There's nothing that great about him. 

228
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,010
 How can you be so uncaring as his sister? He's become so skinny. 

229
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,560
Quickly eat.

230
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,110
Yeon Hee Unni stole them from her house to give them to you, Brother.

231
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,310
Thank you.

232
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,220
No, it's not like that.

233
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,920
When I wasn't around,

234
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,990
you were together with Boon Yi every day.

235
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,070
That... Yeah...

236
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,920
I'm really thankful.

237
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,320
I'll go to your house later and greet your parents.

238
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,790
I'll go gather water and wood every day for your parents.

239
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,010
No. You don't have to.

240
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,440
No. I'm doing it because I'm thankful.

241
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,810
When did you even put an egg in there?

242
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,150
For this year's Seventh Moon Festival, Yeon Hee Unni is the star Vega.

243
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,910
Is that so?

244
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,930
Did you decide on who will be the star Altair?

245
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,690
The person you will give the clothes to.

246
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,610
Not yet.

247
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,630
Have you finished making the clothes for Altair yet?

248
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,220
Not yet.

249
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,280
I hate it when the sleeves are too long, so keep that in mind.

250
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,360
What are you talking about?

251
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,930
The person who will get it from Yeon Hee is me.

252
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,810
What are you talking about?  I've been water carrier since last month.

253
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,450
It's me.

254
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,200
I told you not to do this.

255
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,960
Yeon Hee.  Where are you going?

256
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,670
  Yeon Hee, where are you going? 

257
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,200
Ddang Sae.

258
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,290
You are thinking about your mother, right?

259
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,330
Boon Yi thinks that you told her everything, but

260
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,850
I knew you would be like this

261
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,050
because you are very affectionate.

262
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,370
I'm...

263
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,270
a coward.

264
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,710
Actually, I...

265
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,250
My mother...

266
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,710
I gave up on her.

267
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,250
No, Ddang Sae. You are not a coward.

268
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,130
It's not your fault or your wrongdoing.

269
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,220
It's just that this world is strange.

270
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,290
During the Seventh Moon Festival,

271
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,440
if you don't accept clothes I make...

272
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,510
I'm not going to be the Vega.

273
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:46,280
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

274
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,890
 Do Dang (Highest institute of state affairs during late Goryeo era) 

275
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,250
Look! Look! Look!

276
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,750
Have you seen anyone so shameless?

277
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,370
For someone low in class,

278
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,580
how are you so shamelessly sitting there?

279
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,340
I got promoted to a higher ranking.

280
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,240
Is class everything?

281
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,860
You are just a lowly being who used to translate the Mongolian language.

282
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,700
What!?

283
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,050
- Lowly being!? 
 - Yeah, lowly!

284
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,660
If you feel wronged, you should have used more bribes!

285
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,720
Do you know how much th-th-that position costs?

286
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,780
What?

287
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,500
You should all be embarrassed.

288
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,250
The Japanese have invaded Yangkwang-do.
 (Baek Yoon) 

289
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,270
I don't know about a Japanese invasion... I ought to just...

290
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,810
Stop!

291
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,980
What are you guys doing?!!

292
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,590
The Japanese have crossed the West coast and have pushed up to Yanggwang-do!

293
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,540
As you all know,

294
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:47,280
we need to send soldiers to Yangkwang-do soon as possible.
 (Lee In Gyeom) 

295
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,510
So, who should go this time?

296
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,000
Since Minister Soong Rok has a long lineage of strong warriors,

297
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,230
this will be an excellent opportunity for him to render great service.

298
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,390
Minister Yeong Rok's soldiers are known for their speed, so

299
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,950
I will pass on this great opportunity to him.

300
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,320
Judging by the size of the Japanese army,

301
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,960
your forces put together won't be enough to face them.

302
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Therefore, you will both have to send out your soldiers

303
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,810
Look here, Prime Minister.

304
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,480
We were deployed last time, during the Japanese invasion in Namjoo.

305
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,670
I have 17 men that  were injured.

306
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,910
I, also, in the fierce battle four  months ago,

307
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,430
had about half of my men run away.

308
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:43,450
So are you saying you cannot contribute any soldiers?

309
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,780
Ah, well. I'm just saying it should be done fairly.

310
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,380
Fairly.

311
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,850
Here.

312
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:00,170
He, who excels in martial arts, has mighty soldiers, and has abundant wealth,

313
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,600
is right  here .

314
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,650
- Me? 
 - Yes.

315
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,110
Me?

316
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,280
You see, I... 
   (Gil Tae Mi)  

317
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,470
Recently, there was a flood in my land.

318
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,450
We can only eat porridge!

319
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,960
Why are you like this?

320
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,260
Oh, you!

321
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,990
You own a lot of land around Yanggwang-do, and

322
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,590
that whole area is your base of operations.

323
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,990
I am sorry, but I have nothing to give.

324
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,030
What?

325
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,060
When I entered this court, to contribute to my country,

326
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,090
I have already given all of my land and soldiers.

327
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,550
Then, those who received my property should be the ones to go.

328
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,230
I contributed for times like this.

329
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,870
Right? That's what I did.

330
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,010
You are correct.

331
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,770
The national treasury is already depleted,

332
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,420
and the land that should be rewarded for accomplishments

333
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,100
is now gone.

334
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:32,070
If this is not solved, it is the end for both of us.

335
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,240
In-law!

336
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,230
Why don't you start a business?

337
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,180
Business?

338
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,160
A war business.

339
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,490
A war business? What are you talking about, in-law?

340
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,820
Whose nation is this?

341
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,530
Well...

342
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,590
Our nation?

343
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,290
Goryeo, is a nation that belongs to the people.

344
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:11,230
Ah! Brother in-law's old habits are coming back. That's what a scholar usually says.

345
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,870
This war would protect the people from Japanese. Why must this nation carry all of the burden.

346
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,180
If state land is exhausted, you still have land that belongs to the people.

347
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,600
In any region Japanese invade, you can give out land that once belonged to the people

348
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,260
to those men who volunteer.

349
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,490
Since people were saved from the Japanese, there is justification.

350
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,260
If you do that they will be fighting to give you soldiers

351
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,100
for the war effort.

352
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:48,140
Trading the people's land for the war?

353
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,850
Yes, that's right.

354
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,750
Each would competitively want to contribute soldiers.

355
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:59,490
And if that happens, who do you think will make the decisions?

356
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,180
How about you meet them first?

357
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,890
 Hong In Bang 

358
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,840
 This nation was hopeless. 

359
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,400
I hope you'll give me a chance to serve Goryeo.

360
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,280
I am thankful, but many have already applied. Yes.

361
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,040
It's getting tiresome now.

362
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,500
Yes! Yes! If you can work that out,

363
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,510
out of the land I receive...

364
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,710
This much,

365
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,400
I will give to the Prime Minister to continue the nation's work.

366
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,660
Youngnok Minister who just left...

367
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,640
offered this much.

368
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,270
Then,

369
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:25,840
I'll add this to that.

370
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:34,860
I'll make sure to pass on to the Prime Minister your efforts to contribute to the country.

371

372
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,770
I think we should choose Minister Yeong Rok, Minister Soong Rok, and Minister Gwang Rok.

373
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,750
You may do so.

374
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,750
Indeed, you're awesome.

375
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,210
How is it, Elder?

376
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:26,090
Continue to help us out in the future.

377
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,410
Of course, I will do that.

378
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,690
Hurry and put up stakes and let's go.

379
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,070
 Yes, I understand. 

380
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,830
Hold it like this.

381
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,670
This land belongs to Soon Yi's family.

382
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,100
You will find out later, but this now belongs to the Prime Minister.

383
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,000
Excuse me? What are you saying?

384
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,140
That, what it means is,

385
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,870
from now on you will have to treat me nicely.

386
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,060
Why are you like this?

387
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,400
Well, well. Aren't you growing to be a fine young lady?

388
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,030
What are you doing?

389
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,060
Who are you to come into other people's land and put up wooden posts?

390
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:18,950
From now on this land belongs to Prime Minister Lee In Gyeom.

391
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,140
What? Why would our land suddenly belong to the Prime Minister?

392
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,960
Look here. The Japanese are invading, so the soldiers need to come here.

393
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,410
This is all for paying our soldiers who protect us!

394
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,630
I thought the foreign invaders intruded into another village.

395
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,400
What does that have to do with us?

396
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,470
What?!!  This person...

397
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:46,490
Wow, thank you. When did the government help keep out barbarians? Why put on a show now?

398
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,940
You bastards. We'll protect our own village.

399
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,520
Get lost!

400
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,840
You little rascals...

401
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,600
Hey, get them!!

402
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,590
R-R-Run!

403
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,890
Get them!!

404
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,590
 Yeon Hee 

405
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,450
Wow. It's really good.

406
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,840
What's so good about my stupid brother?

407
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:31,110
Brother!! The clothes came.

408
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,320
Come out quickly!!

409
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,790
Hey, you give them to him. Okay?

410
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,530
You are so lucky!

411
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,190
You are going to wear it nicely.

412
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,340
What? What happened?

413
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,320
The workers we sent to the village got attacked and chased out. Also...

414
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,190
So what? What do you want me to do?

415
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,570
You should take care of those things instead of reporting to me! 
 I've been too lenient.

416
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,420
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,030
Just go take some of our guys and show them who the boss is.

418
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:26,910
Also, don't report those kinds of things to me. You made me lose appetite for alcohol. Go!

419
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:41,890
After today's Seventh Moon Festival, let our households be peaceful and our children prosper.

420
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,320
Let it rain nicely for a fruitful harvest.

421
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:52,140
And pray that everyone in the village stays safe, without any misfortune.

422
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,790
Put it on her already!

423
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,460
What are you waiting for?

424
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,570
Hurry up!

425
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,090
Put it on her already!

426
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,450
Let's run away, Yeon Hee. Let's run away.

427
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:45,600
Ddang Sae, Ddang Sae, Ddang Sae.
 You will be in trouble if you get caught.

428
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,480
Ddang Sae, come quickly. You will be in trouble if you get caught.

429
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,810
You go first. Go first!! 
 You go first!!

430
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,130
How's it feel? Suits you well after being so bothersome.

431
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:13,080
Ajussi...! Pal Mo Ajussi!

432
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,360
Dude! We were told to teach them a lesson, not kill them!

433
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,540
No, killing them  is  teaching them a lesson.

434
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,950
Ajussi! Please!

435
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,440
Pal Mo Ajussi...

436
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,910
Oh oh. Don't worry. Don't worry.

437
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,110
As long as you don't resist, I won't kill you.

438
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,230
Hey, hey, hey... What are you doing?

439
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,650
I will be first!

440
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,910
Go.

441
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,470
I said to go.

442
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,770
I don't want to see your face, go.

443

If I interfered, both Yeon Hee and I would have been killed.

445
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,830
They stabbed Pal Mo Ajussi and killed him!

446
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,980
They were so brutal!

447
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,920
You should've just died together.

448
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,860
Sister Yeon Hee really liked you a lot.

449
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,950
Asleep or awake, she only worried for you!

450
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,400
Hoping you returned safely,

451
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,490
she prayed and prayed!

452
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:06,700
But you wore Yeon Hee's clothes and hid?

453
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:12,410
You should've just died. You should've just died together, you fool!

454
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,200
What are you going to do now?

455
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:40,320
No... Why is this happening?

456
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,590
My child...

457
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,660
Hey kid. Why are you just lying there...

458
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,060
How can this happen?

459
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,690
How are they any different from the Mongols and the Japanese?

460
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,340
What kind of country is this!?

461
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,060
What is this...

462
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,770
Who are you? Why?

463
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,210
Why are you like this?

464
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,580
Who is it?

465
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,280
Mother, run away quickly.

466
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,060
Father...

467
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,990
Mother!! Go and take her away.

468
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,460
I...

469
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,120
There's nothing that I can do.

470
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,300
Whew. Finally, I've found you.

471
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:35,360
Hey kid, what are you doing over there?

472
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,880
You aren't thinking about killing yourself right?

473
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,590
You are trying to kill yourself? Th-That can't happen. With whose permission are you dying?

474
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,060
How dare you try to taint my reputation--

475
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,240
Don't come closer. I'm going to die!

476
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,410
You can't kill yourself. I made a promise to look after you.

477
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,910
That's your thing. It has nothing to do with me!

478
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,310
I! I'm going to die!

479
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,540
I wasn't able to protect anyone.

480
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,880
I couldn't protect my mother.
 I couldn't protect Yeon Hee either!!

481
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,270
I'm just an idiot who can't do anything!

482
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,720
Then you can't die either.

483
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,340
Do you think it's easy? I'll guarantee you,

484
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,420
you won't die.

485
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,950
Why?

486
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,240
Because you are an idiot.

487
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,090
I told you, right? You won't die.

488
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:04,120
Grandpa, who are you?

489
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,090
Jang. Sam. Bong.

490
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,110
How much can you teach me?

491
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:14,250
A lot! 
  (Creator of Tai Chi and sword arts and leader of Wudang Sect.) 

492
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:46,640
Heo Gang left, and everyone left.

493
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,880
Everyone, while being good and weak,

494
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,660
left.

495
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,600
A poster?

496
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,900
You guys... You guys have lost your minds.

497
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,350
Only the shameless ones remained,

498
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,400
and they won.

499
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,510
When everyone left,

500
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,140
I lost my strength

501
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,350
and I lost my way.

502
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,730
It's tiring.

503
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,140
Stop what you are doing!

504
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,690
I figured they would have understood by now, so I was just about to stop.

505
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,350
Should I return to Ham Ju?

506
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,810
What is that? A person?

507
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,840
Are you Lord Baek Yoon?

508
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,190
I'm Baek Yoon. So what's the matter?

509
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,260
Are you... Lord Baek Yoon?

510
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,500
I said I'm him.

511
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,310
Who are you?

512
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,010
Then, that's fine.

513
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,330
 You should've died, you fool. 

514
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,950
 - Please don't kill me!
- Ah!!! 

515
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,840
 Lee Bang Ji 

516
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,880
What did I just see? What was that?

517
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,860
There's no way.

518
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,080

 YeoJin: East of ManJoo, YeonHaeJoo 

522
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:37,250
Th-This is not Goryeo's map.

523
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,130
No.

524
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:01,160
But, why do you want to kill Baek Yoon?

525
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,110
 I will end Goryeo. 

526
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,580
 Assassinate Baek Yoon when the time is right. 

527
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:16,010
 Kill Baek Yoon and end this rotten Goryeo. 

528

 New Joseon 

529
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:22,930
 Just 

530
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,110
 who made this? 

531
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,540

 Sam Bong, where are you? 

534
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,500
 Now, who should I kill? 

535
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,370
 Fourth dragon 

536
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,940

 Where were you last night? Please reveal the truth! 

540
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,430
 Are you saying I killed him? 

541
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,890
 It's a mamushi. It's definitely a mamushi (pit viper). 

542
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,450
 People say he shows up wherever the Japanese are. 

543
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,960
 Don't you recognize me? I'm your father. 

544
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,920
 - What? 
 - You called me your father. 

545
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,320
 We cultivated the wastelands but had all of our crops taken. 

546
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,360
 People were injured and died. 

547
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,630
 - Are you saying such a horrible thing happened in the village? 
- This is against the national law. 

548
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,760
 It's wrong to break the national law. 

549
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,020
 I'm going to do something, because as long as I'm alive I have to do something.
