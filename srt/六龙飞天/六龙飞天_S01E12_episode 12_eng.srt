1
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,190
 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,890
 Who changed the letter? 

3
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,070
 Who would do this? 

4
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,290
 Could it be... Could it be the shadow? 

5
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:09,370
Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom, will you accept my move this time?

6
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,590
So I, since new evidence came to light...

7
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,750
 Will that guy still investigate it in this situation? 

8
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,430
...will interrogate Lee Bang Won again and  get a confession.

9
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,290
 Of course, he would. He's someone who moves according to his temperament. 

10
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,400
 No. No! 

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,180
He will try to deny the letter himself.

12
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,610
If the letter was the right one, then they would have to arrest Lee Seong Gye for killing Baek Yoon.

13
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,910
Will Lee Seong Gye really be struck out?

14
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,650
What if a civil war breaks out with Lee Seong Gye, who commands a military army of 20,000 soldiers?

15
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,930
It's something that's too bothersome for them and they hate dealing with it.

16
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,660
At a time like this, it would be easier to be suspicious of Lee In Gyeom than of Lee Seong Gye.

17
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,400
Warning! General Lee Seong Gye

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,020
has crushed Ho Bal Do!

19
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,190
What? What?

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,920
 General Lee Seong Gye 

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,670
Look here.

22
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,600
Didn't you hear General Lee Seong Gye won a battle?

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,860
But an investigation?

24
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,900
An investigation is just that.

25
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,370
First, look at this letter.

26
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,290
Is Lee Bang Won's name in here? Is Lee Seong Gye's name in here?

27
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,880
 No matter how long I wait, you don't appear. According to your plan, I killed Baek Yoon first. Who do I kill next? 

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,610
Something like this can be said anonymously.

29
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,120
How can something anonymous be evidence?

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,170
To a person who brought victory, can you take this anonymous letter to him and ask,

31
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,170
"Did you kill Lord Baek Yoon?"

32
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,900
- But...
- That's right!

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,200
Thinking about it, this has been a problem since the beginning.

34
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,260
An anonymous letter appearing definitely means there's a basis for destruction.

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,350
- That's what I'm saying!
- From the start, the direction of the investigation has been wrong.

36
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,910
Yes! We have to catch the person who wrote the anonymous letter.
 (Han Goo Young) 

37
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,720
 All the talk about the An Byeon Book has disappated.
(Lee In Gyeom) 

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,380
 In this situation, only absurdity and fear are left. 

39
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,810
 Yes. "What if Lee Seong Gye starts a civil war?"
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)  

40
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,670
 "What if those people are just trying to escape?" You can only think about such concerns. 

41
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,200
What came out of my room?
 (Lee Bang Won) 

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,750
Didn't you hear? The letter left by your leader.

43
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,650
The letter that says Lord Baek Yoon was killed and asks who to kill next.

44
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,610
 How did this happen? Why that? 

45
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,960
Could it be...

46
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,770
There's no way that you did such an enormous thing yourself.

47
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,290
 Does... Does Sam Bong really want to kill me? 

48
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,420
 No, no. Even so, this is not right. 

49
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,010
 This will put Father in danger as well... 

50
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,160
Your father is probably connected.

51
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,830
Stop!

52
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,970
Stop the interrogation?

53
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,310
Yes. In this situation, where Lee Seong Gye won the battle,

54
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,190
it will be hard to mention Lee Seong Gye's name as Baek Yoon's killer...

55
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,520
How can he push Lee Seong Gye as Baek Yoon's killer?

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,660
If he's going to strike Lee Seong Gye, he would call him to Gaegyeong and hit him.

57
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,980
Is he going to go into war with the commander of an army of 20,000 soldiers?

58
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,400
Does he have dementia?

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,600
I think that
 (Hong In Bang) 

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,100
it was not Hap Ha's scheme.

61
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,800
It was not?
 (Gil Tae Mi) 

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Then, did Lee Seong Gye really kill Baek Yoon?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,410
It's not that but either way...

64
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,440
Head of Seonggyungwan Elder!

65
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,370
Monk Jukryong has returned.

66
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,170
Really?

67
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,360
But he came with General Lee Seong Gye's eldest son Lee Bang Woo.

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,720
Let's go.

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,030
Lee Seong Gye is being accused of Baek Yoon's murder?

70
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,700
How could the letter have such content?

71
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,190
That's what I wanted to ask you.

72
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,620
Did you place the letter I gave you at Lee Bang Won's residence?

73
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,750
I heard the report and confirmed it two, three times.
 (Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan's Owner) 

74
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,480
There was no mistake from our side.

75
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,750
If so,

76
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,060
it's that shadow.

77
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,210
It was that shadow's trick.

78
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,210
Then, what should we do? If the interrogation continues and Lee Bang Won confesses that his father instructed him to do it,

79
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,200
the future will be uncertain.

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,720
For now, I ordered it to be stopped.

81
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,860
The interrogation and the investigation.

82
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,190
Follow me.

83
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,740
But isn't the problem here the one in charge of the investigation?

84
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,150
That person doesn't listen and I heard that he's stubborn and headstrong.

85
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,600
If that kind of person is in charge of it, do you think he will stop?

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,090
If not, why else would General Choi Yeong call him a dumb head?

87
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,800
That dumb head also got sent into exile numerous times while trying to impeach you.

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,780
Will he obediently listen to you?

89
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,610
He's been sent to exile numerous time and yet he neglects that.

90
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,890
Why do you think he is has remained in his position up to now?

91
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,960
Will I think highly of that person's backbone?

92
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:28,370


93
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,170
I'm sorry, Hap Ha.

94
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,020
I should have checked the contents of the letter before entering the Do Dang.

95
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,100
It was my carelessness.

96
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,140
Say your greetings.

97
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,740
This is the one in charge of the investigation office, Nam dumb head.

98
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,390
This is Cho Young.

99
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,740
As expected of you, Hap Ha.

100
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,290
So you say  it was definitely in the place it was left in,

101
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,590
but the letter that you took out was a different letter?

102
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,810
Does anyone come to mind?

103
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,580
During the time that I was in politics,

104
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,220
there was only one time that I got tricked like this.

105
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,390
That's why I made it so that he could not enter Gaegyeong.

106
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,880
But that person keeps being fishy.

107
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,800
Are you talking about Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon?

108
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Why did you think so?

109
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,690
A while back, Bi Guk Temple's Jukryong mentioned Jeong Do Jeon's name.

110
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,140
Because of what?

111
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,190
He was looking for Jeong Do Jeon on someone's orders.

112
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,930
 Who do you think that someone could be? 

113
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,280
 Everybody knows that Hong In Bang puts Jukryong in charge. 

114
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,710
It is possible that the shadow behind Hong In Bang is Jeong Do Jeon.

115
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:08,830
Anyway, Lee Bang Won is connected to that shadow.

116
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,510
That's not all. I think he's also connected to the assassin who killed Baek Yoon.

117
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,670
Next time, do an interrogation regarding that shadow.

118
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,740
You must only report to me.

119
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,030
Yes, Hap Ha.

120
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,460
Also, about the movements of Ham Joo's Ga Byeol Cho,
 (Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army) 

121
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,840
observe them closely.

122
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,780
Yes, I have already made preparations.

123
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,240
As soon as the Ga Byeol Cho moves, I will immediately receive information.

124
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,970
Also,

125
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,030
we need to detain the person who placed the letter.

126
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,930
The one I sent, called Yak San, is someone who is tight-lipped.

127
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,070
Even if he is tight-lipped,

128
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,950
it's not like a dead body.

129
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,590
Yes. I understand.

130
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,050
 What?  Bang Won commanded Baek Yoon's killer?

131
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,770
What an impossible accusation!
 (Lee Bang Woo) 

132
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,590
This is way too much for Hap Ha.

133
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,450
Our family is ready to fight.

134
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,990
We have to save Bang Won.

135
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,850
 Elder, Monk Nam Cheol has arrived. 

136
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,550
Open it.

137
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,570
I secretly placed someone at Hwa Sa Dan when I went to Ham Joo.
 (Jukryong: Bi Guk Temple Head Monk) 

138
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,950
Did anything happen during that time?

139
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,330
Isn't there a Yak San from a distinguished family of robbers?

140
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,490
That person was requested for something at Hwa Sa Dan.

141
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,590
Since then, he often goes around prostitute houses and appears to have gained a fortune.

142
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,570
It's that bastard! That person left the forged letter.

143
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,530
Then, catching that person and handing him over to the investigation office is top priority.

144
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,990
How can you believe the investigation office? Hap Ha's people are spread throughout that place too.

145
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,590
The one in charge of the investigation is a man of integrity, right?

146
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,110
That is true but...

147
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,190
First, secure that person called Yak San.

148
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,750
Yes.

149
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,270
 It wasn't Hap Ha but Sam Bong? 

150
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,230
 Sam Bong planned this but why is there no communication? 

151
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,810
Did you settle payment with Yak San?

152
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,050
I will meet him today and pay him.

153
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:42,130
Send him far away. It would be better if it's Book Mang San.
 (Book Mang San: a place where dead people go) 

154
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,130
I understand.

155
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,550
Are you Yak San?

156
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,910
Right?

157
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,890
W-W-Who are you?
 (Yak San) 

158
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,470
Let's go quietly.

159
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,510
Aigoo. Thank you.

160
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,470
Ah, this makes me tremble...

161
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,250
I won't show myself in Gaegyeong for the time being.

162
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,430
Just hurry and give me my payment.

163
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,730
I'm sorry. I will bury your corpse.

164
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,470
Please save me. Please save me!

165
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,340


166
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,350
If you are the person called Yak San, I will save you.

167
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,230
Yes. Yes. I am Yak San. I am Yak San.

168
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,010
Since stopping the interrogation, we haven't fed him or let him sleep for four days.

169
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,910
He's firm but he will collapse soon.

170
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,690
Now, you will be in charge.

171
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,210
Yes.

172
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,770
You've worked hard.

173
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,850
It's a shame that I have to relay this sad news to you.

174
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,670
The Northeastern region's Ga Byeol Cho was defeated by Ho Bal Do.

175
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,110
Your father, General Lee Seong Gye, is also in a life and death situation.

176
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,930
Right now,

177
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,110
what are you saying?

178
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,220
The Ga Byeol Cho was defeated and General Lee Seong Gye seems to have been killed in battle.

179
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm sorry.

180
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,480
Ga Byeol Cho... Ga Byeol Cho...

181
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,280
was annihilated and Father...

182
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,340
My Father...

183
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:42,170
He only trusted his father so his shock must be great.

184
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,620
Make every situation hopeless and after he gives up on his own,

185
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,300
I will get the truth out of him. When he wakes up, I will continue with the next step.

186
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,490
Watch him carefully.

187
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,780
It will be difficult if he really dies.

188
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,020
Does that mean that he hasn't fainted?

189
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,930
Even when you said his father is dead?

190
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,320
On that day, in our Bang Won's room,

191
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,870
he confessed to placing a letter secretly.

192
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,840
Please investigate this person.

193
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,710
You are the only one who will do a fair investigation.

194
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,130
What is your name?

195
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,050
Ya-Ya-Ya... Yak San. My name is Yak San.

196
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,940
 Just how... How did this happen? 

197
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:18,680
So on the seventh day of the month, you secretly infiltrated General Lee Seong Gye's house

198
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,190
and left the red envelope with the letter in Lee Bang Won's room?

199
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,210
Yes, yes, yes.

200
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,950
I was told that I would be given some silver coins for just putting it in there.

201
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,160
And the person who ordered you to do that is a girl from Hwa Sa Dan?

202
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,840
That girl didn't personally say it, but

203
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,620
I've also lived my life on the ground for thirty years.

204
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,420
There's no doubt that she's from Hwa Sa Dan.

205
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,640
From here on, listen carefully.

206
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,470
If I keep you alive, the things that you said now,

207
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,790
you must not say to anyone except me.

208
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,620
Yes?

209
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,960
This is something that has a complicated relationship to the Do Dang.

210
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,760
So you can only live if you trust me and follow what I say.

211
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,940
Yes, yes!

212
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,140
I think it was intended. Even Hwa Sa Dan was mentioned.

213
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,250
I've shut his mouth but what should we do?

214
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,670
What's with you?

215
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,320
We came because we heard that the person who slandered General Lee Seong Gye was arrested.

216
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,600
Pressure from outside forces. We were worried about that.

217
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,150
It seems to be a useless concern now that I see you came here first.

218
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,600
What are you implying?

219
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,250
I also only heard the news and wanted to understand the situation better, so I came here.

220
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,770
Hap Ha wasn't threatening you or bribing you, right?

221
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,270
Then, you must stick to us. We will definitely guarantee a fair investigation.

222
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,170
Whether it's this side or that side, there's no reason for me to stick on either side.

223
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,740
Investigating is my job.

224
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,520
Since you said that, you look more trustworthy. Go ahead.

225
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,830
By the way, about the forged letter that came out of Lee Bang Won's room.

226
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,560
is there no way to see it again? It would be nice if you could show me.

227
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,270
There was no particular movement from the Ga Byeol Cho.

228
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,550
Are you sure?

229
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,100
An army of that size cannot move secretly.

230
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,920
We will receive a message if there's even a slight action.

231
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,190
Continue watching them and notify me of everything.

232
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,780
Yes.

233
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,670
They are...

234
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,630
They are all your family?

235
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,230
Yes, our family is kind of blessed.

236
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,270
What are you doing? Quickly greet them!

237
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,980
- I am Han Nom.
- Du Shik 
(all their names start with a number)

238
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,530
- Suk Sam
- Nuh Gu Ri!

239
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,980
- Oh Sori
- Yuk Son!

240
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,600
- Chil Taek
- Pal Pal!

241
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,880
- Gu Teol!
- I am Hong Dae Hong!

242
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,230
Its Hong Dae Hong, and Hong Dae Hong in reverse as well.

243
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,030
End of numbers!

244
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,610
Is he your father? Didn't you say he passed away?

245
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,930
What? N-No.

246
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,600
Oh. If I can explain myself, I am the creator of the 24 moves of Dong Bang Double Dragon,

247
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,890
the teacher of Mu Hyul and the best swordsmen of Goryeo.

248
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,810
Stop it!

249
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,200
I will not forget this debt, even after death,

250
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,530
for accepting our family.

251
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,640
We will do anything you command.

252
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,840
Lead them to the residence for now.

253
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,570
See me after.

254
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,500
What? Young master Bang Won?

255
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,030
Yeah, that is why he is imprisoned there.

256
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,920
Likewise, that happened because I was not there.

257
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,740
I will definitely save him even if I have to break in.

258
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,300
Don't overreact!

259
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,610
Older Master already took care of it so he will be free soon.

260
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,380
 I'll have to do something so my family does not have a rough time. 

261
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,150
If that's so that's a relief.

262
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,460
Oh yeah. Did you learn martial arts from that round guy that said something about 24 moves of double dragon?

263
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,280
No.

264
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,610
What do you mean the 24 moves of the Twin Dragons of the East? That person is the 24 levels of Swindler of the East Crap!
 (He changed the original characters of the title) 

265
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,290
 Go to the market with others and give the message I wrote. 

266
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,310
 This is the way to save Bang Won. 

267
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,910
 Among the taffy sellers you will see a familiar face.  

268
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,630
 Do not act like you know him.  

269
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,240
Uh... give me a taffy.

270
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,470
B-B-Boon!

271
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,020
What can I give you?

272
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,680
This rice taffy if really good, and this is as well.

273
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,110
Oh no the bean taffy will be the best.

274
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,070
Thank you.

275
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,120
Oh for the pretty lady, I will give you one more.

276
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,230
The back alley, back alley.

277
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,420
I am sorry.

278
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,240
It's okay.

279
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,270
For someone who looks normal, did you not eat for days?

280
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,070
Why are you eating so fast? You are going to get sick.

281
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,070
I have gluttony with food.

282
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,770
Do you guys make good money over here?

283
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes, we are the best ones around here.

284
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,030
Is that so? When do you guys do the acting?

285
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,800
Every day.

286
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,340
What are you doing? He's a pitiful guy.

287
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,580
Go inside, and don't act like you know him from now on.

288
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,430
Come again.

289
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,850
Didn't I warn you that I might kill you the next time I see you?

290
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,630
I'm going to forget you, so you forget me as well.

291
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,830
Don't come again.

292
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,610
For what reason are you keep coming here?

293
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,050
I... have something to answer to him.

294
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,400
This is not the time to do this.

295
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,490
General Lee might come here.

296
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,120
The general will not come here.

297
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,710
How are you so certain?

298
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,720
If he brings the army, then that means war,

299
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,650
and if he comes alone it will be the same as suicide.

300
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,870
Lee In  Gyeom and General Lee are looking for the right time to negotiate.

301
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,750
Didn't you say that you would save Lee Bang Won?

302
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,420
I said I'm going to save him,

303
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,620
but I never said I'm going to take care of the things he did.

304
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:45,570
Infuriating his father by faking the document or looking for Hong In Bang on his own and getting arrested by Lee In Gyeom.

305
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,020
Everything is because of his own actions. Is that the only thing?

306
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:56,070
He will come to learn how all the words he loudly proclaimed were for nothing.

307
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,800
The loneliness he feels being by himself and not knowing what is going on outside

308
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,410
will make him weak, and when that happens

309
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:08,410
he will start to feel defeated and believe that he will never will be able to defeat them.

310
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,660
At that moment, choosing to surrender or not

311
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,060
is something I cannot do for him. Only he himself can do that.

312
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,770
He will learn that it is responsibility.

313
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,850
 The Northeastern region's Ga Byeol Cho has been defeated by Ho Bal Do. 

314
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,830
 We do not even know if your father General Lee is alive or not. 

315
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,830
 Is that true? 

316
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,840
 No, father wouldn't do that. 

317
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,560
 Perhaps, because of me?   

318
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,820
 Did he do that in the war because of the things I did? 

319
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,070
Because of me.

320
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,080
Please take me out! My father passed away.

321
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,720
Take me out!

322
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,550
Let me out!

323
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,630
I...

324
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,580
 He will surrender soon. 

325
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,640
The only rope he was relying on got cut.

326
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,780
For now he will only cry out and release his anger, but he will soon accept reality and

327
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,220
tell us everything. But the problem is—

328
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,380
The guy Yak San.

329
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,420
Do you have your eyes on Hwa Sa Dang and Do Ha Jun?

330
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,710
We already had our eyes on Hwa Sa Dang.

331
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,580
And as for Do Ha Jun, we have our man there.

332
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,680
But I cannot do anything about the prison.

333
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,600
Do not worry. Boo Man Ho will be very cautious.

334
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,220
He's a man no one can easily touch.

335
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,990
What are you thinking about so deeply?

336
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,560
No. I'm just.

337
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,180
We cannot be certain. Hap Ha is a scary person.

338
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:45,120
We cannot let our guard down before we get a confession from that guy, Yak San.

339
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,900
We don't know what he will do.

340
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,820
 Eliminate him. 

341
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,390
If Yak San dies, you will be under suspicion.

342
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,360
Not if you make it so that I don't fall under suspicion.

343
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,970
Do as I say.

344
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,020
After the intense battle, the Ga Byeol Cho were defeated and retreated.

345
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,250
General Lee took his leftover soldiers to Ham Joo fortress and was besieged.

346
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,630
But, the enemy soldiers surrounded the castle and

347
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,270
eventually it was overtaken.

348
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,420


349
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,090
This is the only way you can live.

350
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,410
Even if you confess all the things you saw, you will just die here.

351
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,370
Do as I say.

352
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,010
Who are you?! Catch him.

353
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,820
Catch that guy!.

354
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,210
What are you saying?

355
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:32,210
Just as I said. Last night, while criminal Yak San was trying to escape, he was killed.

356
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,210
I am very sorry.

357
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,520
How are you guarding the criminal that something like this can happen?!

358
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,920
If you ask for responsibility, I'll accept it.

359
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,380
What kind of responsibility can you accept?

360
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,620
If you want redeem yourself for this mistake,

361
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,090
you have to double your efforts regarding Lee Bang Won's investigation.

362
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,830
Yes, Hap Ha.

363
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,430
Ha Pa did this.

364
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,520
Hap Ha killed the guy, Yak San.

365
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,270
The one in charge of the investigation is upright

366
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,900
and good at his job. I believed him because of those rumors.

367
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,100
How can we be attacked so helplessly.

368
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,810
Now we don't know if he is on Hap Ha's side.

369
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,460
Only if Yak San confessed could we have made Hap Ha to back down.

370
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,580
But, everything is gone now.

371
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,810
It's not over yet.

372
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,370
There is still one thing.

373
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,030
This is the message that came out of Lee Bang Won's room.

374
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,340
I asked them to make a copy of the original.

375
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,400
So?

376
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,430
For swordsmen, their style of fighting is embedded in their writing.

377
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,880
Yes, their sword style and writing are suppose to be similar.

378
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,620
On that night the sword style I saw

379
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,840
 was very similar to this writing. 

380
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,900
 If I am right, this letter is not fake, 

381
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,800
but was really written by him.

382
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,960
So?

383
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,910
If its true that  Hap Ha put this in Lee Bang Won's room,

384
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,890
and if this is real,

385
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:25,300
then that warrior is someone Ha Pa raised. So, therefore, we have to catch that warrior guy.

386
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,990
Then we can completely turn the tables.

387
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,110
You said you had an encounter with that guy, right?

388
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,160
Yes.

389
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,600
Let's have a duel.

390
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,620


391
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
I am certain. It is that guy.

392
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,950
The one who killed Baek Yoon, the one who infiltrated Bi Guk Temple, and the one who attacked you, In-law,

393
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,190
is the same guy that wrote the letter.

394
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,630
 The look on Hong In Bang's face was so fun to watch. 

395
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,770
Then what are you going to do now?

396
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:26,330
In order to save his son, he will try to negotiate.

397
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,460
From that negotiation, I will get rid of the An Byeon Book

398
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,420
and destroy his relationship with Hong.

399
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:45,560
Therefore, Lee Bang Won's confession is important.

400
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,420
We have to find out who the shadow guy is

401
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,890
who made this table and challenged me.

402
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:10,430
You must be in a great deal of shock, since your father is like that.

403
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:19,030
But, as I think about it more, I do not believe that your father had any reason to kill Baek Yoon.

404
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:26,370
But, all these happenings around the An Byeon Book are very suspicious.

405
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,940
I believe that there is someone who made this table,

406
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,740
and you seem to know something about it.

407
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,040
I am trying to help you.

408
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:49,000
You know who made this table. Tell me.

409
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,710
Come on.

410
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:04,470
Is it perhaps, Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeom?

411
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:18,980
My father, during the siege.

412
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,190
That is right.

413
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:29,310
General Lee besieged.

414
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,680
General Lee besieged?

415
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:51,240
My father, General Lee, during his 150 wars and fights,

416
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,870
has never been besieged.

417
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,400
What do you really know about them?

418
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:14,490
If Ga Byeol Cho was destroyed  by Ho Bal Do,

419
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,550
in four days Ho Bal do should be here.

420
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,860
Then what are you doing here?

421
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,310
Even during the Red Turban invasion and the Mongol invasion,

422
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,220
abandoning the capital, abandoning the people.

423
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:47,280
Isn't that the tradition of the current politicians of Goryeo, who were the first to run away?

424
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,110
That was those people's custom and tradition.

425
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,930
However you guys...

426
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:03,510
While Ga Byeol Cho was defeated you are here with no worry, investigating me?

427
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:21,970
You will never be able to make me surrender.

428
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,610
You will not learn even one thing from me.

429
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,430
Why?

430
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,770
Because I know what a war is

431
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,850
and you don't.

432
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,560
Do you know what a war is?

433
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:51,410
A war is eventually about killing someone.

434
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,630
I already started a war when I was twelve.

435
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,480
That is me, Lee Bang Won.

436
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,140
 There is no action in the Ga Byeol Cho. 

437
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,710
It is said that after the battle, all efforts are going into reconstruction.

438
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,710
They should be.

439
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,350
 Hap Ha! Hap Ha! 

440
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,330
What is it? We have a guest here.

441
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:41,230
Uh, Hap Ha. At the front gate...

442
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,500
At the front gate.

443
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,820
What about the front gate?

444
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,350
General Lee is here.

445
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,870
 On top of that he is in his combat clothes and is holding a bow. 

446
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,260
Oh, General Lee. When did you get here?

447
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,100
Congratulations on your victory.

448
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,660
Once again you saved Goryeo.

449
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,620
But, did you come back from hunting?

450
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:29,920
What are these soldiers?

451
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:38,960
Because you came holding a bow the servants were worried, I guess.

452
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,490
I am quiet the scaredy cat.

453
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:56,520
Please speak. What is it about?

454
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,200
Please release Bang Won.
 (Lee Seong Gye) 

455
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,540
That is...

456
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,810
You have to release him.

457
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:11,490
Since you are already coming up strongly,

458
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,090
I also have nothing to hide.

459
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:23,570
Will you withdraw the An Byeon Book and go back to Ham Joo?

460
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:29,700
If I was going to make a deal with you, why else would I come here carrying my bow and arrow?

461
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,090
You're being disrespectful. Didn't you pledge your loyalty to me?

462
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,200
I did.

463
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,260
Because then, I was just a dog of Cho Joo Ji Ga. 
 (Cho Joo Ji Ga: The dog-like family that bit its owner. Refers to Lee Seong Gye who betrayed Jo So Saeng.) 

464
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,660
So are you not like that anymore?

465
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,320
Should I tell everyone about it even right now?

466
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,910
After serving as a Boo Won Bae all your life, you saw the tides turning.  (Boo Won Bae: The group that betrayed the country to mooch off of the Yuans.) 

467
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,820
You betrayed your sworn brother and opened the fortress gate.

468
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,150
The one who surrendered Goryeo

469
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,280
is Lee Seong Gye.

470
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:13,500
The story of how the Ssang Seong Colonial Office was reclaimed in the Year of 1356 being known

471
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,050
scared me, so I lived like that.

472
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:23,960
However, Bang Won turning like this, I understand now.

473
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,590
I am not a dog of Cho Joo Ji Ga,

474
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,430
but a tiger that lost its cub.

475
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,930
The most important thing in a man's life is honor.

476
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:41,250
Why did I hide the truth about Jo So Saeng to protect my honor?

477
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:47,290
It's because if I am not honorable, I won't be able to protect my people.

478
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,950
But Lee In Gyeom,

479
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,610
you did something you shouldn't have done.

480
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,830
How dare you mess with the people who are close to this Lee Seong Gye?

481
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,870
My family, my son at that!

482
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,480
I am speechless at how truly arrogant you are.

483
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,960
To the Moon Ha Shi Joong who is above all but one man (the king), 
 (Moon Ha Shi Joong: highest ranking government position in Goryeo) 

484
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,810
in the middle of the night, you dare threaten me with a bow and arrow?

485
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,360
With my one order, even with just this,

486
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,020
you'd be leaving this room dead.

487
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,900
Oftentimes,

488
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,560
people are mistaken about one thing.

489
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:52,210
I'm talking about the prejudice that bows and arrows are only weapons for long distances.

490
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,370
It is usually like that.

491
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,050
But not for Lee Seong Gye.

492
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,960
Even with six of you, whatever you do,

493
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,260
you cannot be faster than me shooting Lee In Gyeom.

494
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:29,780
As long as I have a bow and arrow, you cannot save his life.

495
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:08,820
Release Bang Won by tomorrow morning.

496
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:28,970
Let's go.

497
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,200
Yes, General.

498
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,910
 Bon Won! Elder Bon Won! 

499
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,580
General Lee Seong Gye went into Do Hwa Jeon.
 (Do Hwa Jeon: Lee In Gyeom's house) 

500
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,210
Without any escorts?

501
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,340
He is only accompanied by General Lee Ji Ran.

502
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,630
Is he still there?

503
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,120
He came out of Do Hwa Jeon a while ago but didn't go to his house.

504
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,920
Was I mistaken about Lee Seong Gye?

505
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,380
We have to find him. We must find him tonight.

506
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,460
Yes. I have ordered people to find him.

507
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,810
Just what is he up to? Where is he going?

508
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,680
Did you receive news that General Lee Seong Gye arrived in Gaegyeong?

509
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,350
You should hurry and look for him too, then report back to me.

510
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,560
Why isn't there any response?

511
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,100
Elder Bon Won.
 (Lee Shin Jeok) 

512
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,170
It seems that it was really urgent so I escorted him here without permission.

513
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,100
Who?

514
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,740
We need to arrest Lee Seong Gye.

515
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:48,530
At the Do Dang meeting tomorrow,

516
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,780
raise a petition for Lee Seong Gye to be arrested.

517
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,840
But Hap Ha!

518
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,980
Accuse him of being Baek Yoon's killer.

519
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,570
Lee Seong Gye would have the 20,000 soldiers of the Ga Byeol Cho.

520
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,770
Have you thought about a civil war breaking out?

521
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:14,070
Lee Seong Gye came to Gaegyeong by himself.

522
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,120
How could he?

523
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,840
Anyway, it's an opportunity, right?

524
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,260
Another thing.

525
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,380
Tell the person in charge of the investigation.

526
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,760
By tonight,

527
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,820
there has to be a confession from Lee Bang Won.

528
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,250
Yes, I understand.

529
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,500
I will inform our members.

530
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,420
Didn't you tell me to establish a new country with you?

531
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,760
Yes, that's right.

532
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,460
I couldn't do that. The people under me, my comrades, the Ga Byeol Cho

533
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,330
and their families. I can't do anything besides protect them.

534
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:00,950
Then why did you come to Gaegyeong by yourself at this time?

535
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,370
Why did you come to find me in this cave?

536
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:07,970
It's to protect my people.

537
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,230
- To save Bang Won.
- Saving Bang Won would be enough?

538
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,260
No. Not just Bang Won,

539
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,970
but to protect my people too. I must go into politics.

540
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,490
I have to enter the Do Dang.

541
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,150
Didn't you say you would serve me?

542
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:32,220
You said you will be my tactician. A plan to save Bang Won.

543
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,000
Do you have it

544
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,110
or not?

545
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,290
Morning will come soon.

546
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,000
Fine. Did you say your people?

547
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,590
I should start from there.

548
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,950
Do you have it or not?

549
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,490
A plan...

550
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,210
Of course, I have it.

551
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,470
Let's go.

552
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,490
Where am I going?

553
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,310
You will see when you get there.

554
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:34,390


555
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,870
 That man said so, himself, that he's a storyteller. There's no way of knowing if that is true. 

556
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,850
 That's the only clue right now. 

557
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,890
Ah, excuse me.

558
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:10,390
I heard that the famous storyteller is staying here.

559
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,950
Ah, the storyteller?
 (Gab Boon) 

560
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,370
You did really good job coming here to find him.

561
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,230
Wait a second.

562
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:23,950
Brother! Brother, we've a customer.

563
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:33,190
 Aigoo!  You who came looking for a storyteller this early in the morning,

564
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:37,670
who are you? I am

565
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:43,170
the one who can sing! The one who can dance!

566
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,750
The one who does the representative dances for masked performances!

567
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,370
The one who leaves you breathless. I'm the storyteller.

568
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,570
Is that so?

569
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,190
Yes, that's right.

570
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,010
Can you take off that mask?

571
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,960
General Lee came to see me last night.

572
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,560
He came to Gaegyeong?

573
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,060
Regarding Head of Seonggyungwan Baek Yoon's death,

574
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:28,590
there are a lot of rumors going around, and yet he comes to Gaegyeong. Don't you think he's that confident?

575
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:36,390
But this time, let's do our best in this investigation to reject those accusations.

576
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:43,910
It is true that he is being accused, and in his son Bang Won's room,

577
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,690
that something displeasing was found there is also true.

578
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:56,310
If we cannot clearly expose it, what do we need the Do Dang for?

579
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:05,220
Arresting the General, whether he committed the crime or not,

580
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,870
is the right thing to do.

581
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,750
There's no reason to arrest him.

582
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,820
Why are you saying that?

583
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,520
It's because he is here right now.

584
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,310
General, please come in.

585
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:09,310
The letter found in my fifth son's room was fabricated.

586
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,120
Yes.

587
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:20,030
We need to do an investigation to prove whether or not the letter was fabricated and whether or not you are guilty.

588
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:25,470
There is no evidence for either of them.

589
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:29,610
Evidence. I have it.

590
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,470
Oh, I see.

591
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,070
Show us then.

592
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,680
Bang Woo!

593
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:14,420
This person is a thief called Yak San who escaped from the investigation office.

594
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,800
Ah, that person!

595
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,530
 Lee Seong Gye, you bastard. 

596
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,750
Teacher,

597
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,910
how come you're here?

598
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:41,700
 Brother, please recommend that person called Nam dumb head be in charge of the investigation. 

599
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,830
 You appear after so many years and what are you suddenly saying? 

600
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,850
This time, please believe me a little.

601
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,410
 There's a stubborn and hardheaded person in the investigation office. 

602
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,310
 Ah, you're talking about the person called Nam dumb head? 

603
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:59,140
 Then we can just put that person in charge. 

604
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,390
 Ah, hyu... 

605
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,460
 I'm sorry. 

606
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,340
 It's fine. 

607
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:31,560
Yak San, the thief, has confessed about everything that happened on that night.

608
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:36,970
He said that he secretly planted the letter in Bang Won's room.

609
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:51,570
Now we just need to find the individual who ordered this person.

610
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,670
What's going on?

611
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:11,460
You've suffered a lot. Your father will be fine too.

612
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,840
This person, too,

613
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,860
was your person?

614
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,960
Until the end, he never mentioned your name.

615
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,790
Say your greetings.

616
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,230
This is the troublesome Pok Doo.

617
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,020
Pok Doo...

618
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,730
This is the one in charge of the investigation office, Nam dumb head.

619
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,550
But Brother, how could you also call me that?

620
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,980
Your nickname was famous. What was your name originally?

621
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,840
Ah, seriously..

622
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,930
Well... My mother used to call me that too.

623
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,470
You worked hard. I am the stubborn guy at the investigation office,

624
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,070
Nam Eun.

625
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,770
 Nam Eun: a revolutionary comrade who worked with Jeong Do Jeon until the end. 

626
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,030
Nam Eun...

627
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,330
Pok Doo...

628
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:24,620
It's a great chance for you to get rid of me. Why did you make it this complicated?

629
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,360
Why do you think?

630
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,830
If I take the torture and die,

631
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:37,650
the situation with the forged An Byeon Book document will change, and Father will stand up and

632
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:41,780
risk his life to fight Lee In Gyeom.

633
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,940
Is this what you wanted?

634
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,070
That's what I wanted.

635
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,840
But why?

636
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,800
No way.

637
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:58,280
Humane affection, something like that?

638
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,270
I'll be disappointed if that is the case.

639
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:06,760
Crazy bastard. I don't feel anything like that for you.

640
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,580
Just one. I wagered on one thing.

641
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,670
The fact that you are still young.

642
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:18,960
The fact that you still have opportunity. I put my bet on that.

643
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,670
Aren't you supposed to get rid of a troublemaker while he's still young?

644
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:28,810
This is what being young is. I will get a hold of such thoughts of yours.

645
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,040
From now on, call me your teacher.

646
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:57,570


647
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,400
 Six Flying Dragons 

648
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,420
 Thank you for saving me. Is it possible to drive those people out? We need to win. 

649
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,390
 - We will win.
- Can you promise me, man to man? 

650
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:18,940
 Could you be... That's why Boon Yi earnestly pleaded to have you saved. 

651
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,240
 Why didn't you tell me? 

652
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,810
 In-law! Now that I open my eyes, the world has changed. You and I are in the center! 

653
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:29,530
 Relay my congratulations to the person who planned it and won. 

654
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,190
 Our alliance will end here. 

655
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:36,140
 Now, bit by bit, I have come to know Lee Seong Gye, who will be the king of the country I will establish. 

656
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,940
 Brother, what is wrong with you these days? 

657
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,660
 He has appeared! That storyteller has appeared! 

658
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,690
 Ja Il Saek... Yeon Hee! Yeon Hee! 

659
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,300
 You're a Hwa Sa Dan spy, Ja Il Saek.
