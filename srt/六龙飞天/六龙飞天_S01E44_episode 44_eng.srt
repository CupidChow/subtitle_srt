00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,980
 Episode 44 

3
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,080
 Could it be that your merciless move is 

4
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,340
 related to this, Lee Bang Won? 

5
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:10,450
 Take my merciless and fatal move, 

6
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,140
 Teacher. 

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,500


8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,870
How can Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) do this impossible thing?
 (Zhu Yuanzhang: First Ming Emperor) 

9
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,120
Yes, Your Highness.

10
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,620
Lord Sam Bong has no connection to the document from China.

11
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,500
Transferring Lord Sam Bong is illogical.

12
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,520
How can this be...

13
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,360
Ming has an ulterior motive for this.

14
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,300
Have you found out about Prince Jeong An's activities while in Ming?

15
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,440
In Liaodong, Prince Jeong An met Ju Che (Zhu Di) who's been going around the provinces to comfort the people.

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,360
Ju Che wrote a letter to Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang).

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,980
Is Prince Jeong An still with Nameless?

18
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,980
There's no reason for him to break away from them.

19
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,400
The Yeojin (Jurchen) tribe assimilation policy has been irritating the Mings.

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,600
You have the military power on top of that.

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,950
So they targeted me?

22
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,580
This has been arranged by Prince Jeong An, Ming, and Nameless.

23
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,120
So you must never go.

24
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,310
Your Highness, you must never send Sam Bong to Ming.

25
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,310
Queen, don't think about it

26
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,880
and just focus on getting better.

27
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,750
Your Highness, please promise me

28
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,140
you will never... Sam Bong...

29
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,360
That will not happen. Don't worry.

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,060
Before I left for Ming, I told you to put honey in your mouths and hide swords in your hearts.

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,300
I'll have to make use of the sword I've prepared.

32
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,180
Yes. I've put Jo Mal Saeng, the scholar you talked about, in Seonggyungwan.

33
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,390
What is this hidden sword and who is Jo Mal Saeng?

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,890
Are those all names of people?

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,660
Your Highness, I'll use my hidden sword in a more crucial moment.

36
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:35,130
Yes. Please take an active part in the royal palace this time.

37
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,640
Then it's been a while, but I'll put my sly tongue to good use.

38
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,510
May I see the hidden sword you've been preparing, Father-in-law?

39
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,860
After Po Eun, he's the Confucian scholar with the most followers.

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,660
Bring him in.

41
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,770
You...

42
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,830
I am Gwon Geun, a scholar in the Department of Royal Records.

43
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,530
Isn't he a follower of Lord Moo Geung?

44
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,370
How can Teacher Yang Chon be...

45
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,850
After what happened to Teacher Po Eun, you probably hate me.

46
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,550
Why are you going to follow me?

47
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,230
Why the will of Heaven is going in a different direction than what's said in literature,
 (Gwon Geun - nickname Yang Chon, student of Lee Saek) 

48
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,770
I have no way of knowing that.

49
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,070
Also, Your Highness is not someone who I respect.

50
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:46,190
I only came here with gritted teeth  because the current great cause is with Your Highness.

51
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,500
Great cause? What is my great cause?

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,940
First, I am against the existence of a prime minister.

53
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,300
I believe that a strong royal authority is needed for a country to run well.

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,900
And second, if you can promise the future,

55
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,120
I hope that you will restore Teacher Po Eun's honor.

56
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,420
I will do so, Teacher Yang Chon.

57
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,900
I will not send anyone to Ming.

58
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,420
I will not say yes to Ming's demands anymore.

59
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,890
But Your Highness...

60
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,520
You must not, Your Highness.

61
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,200
Please send Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon.

62
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,090
What are you saying?

63
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,050
Lord Sam Bong has no relation to the document from China

64
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,560
so why do you want to send him?

65
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,200
No, he does not have any connection to it.

66
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,400
The problem is not the document from China.

67
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
It is the stacked up misunderstandings from both countries.

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,620
Misunderstandings? Which ones?

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,800
It's Ming's misunderstandings and anxiety about our Joseon's maintenance of the Northern borders.

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,120
If that's not it, why would they ask for Lord Sam Bong, who is responsible for the military forces?

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
So?

72
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,640
This is only Ming's small misunderstanding.

73
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,000
If the person involved will go and clearly explain it,

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,400
this could be an opportunity to turn misfortune into our advantage.

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,690
That's right, Your Highness.

76
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,780
If you don't send anyone, the relationship between the two countries will get worse.

77
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,910
Your Highness, you must not.

78
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,030
If Lord Sam Bong goes to the Ming, there is a high probability that  he'll be detained.

79
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,520
That's right.

80
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,290
Sending someone with responsibility over the military, as hostage to a foreign country, cannot ever happen.

81
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,960
But!

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,680
If we don't do this,

83
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
the people would think of Lord Sam Bong as a petty man

84
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,280
who chose to protect himself instead of the country's safety.

85
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,570
A country's military power to a pettyâ€”

86
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,770
What? Petty?

87
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,410
Look here, everyone.

88
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,020
This is the royal palace where His Highness is present.

89
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,450
How can you talk so insolently?

90
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:32,130
Then, what do you think, Left Minister?

91
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,280
It's indeed an unfair demand

92
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,050
but it's also a diplomacy problem that we cannot ignore.

93
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,180
What do you mean?

94
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,020
Are you saying your words and my words are all wrong?

95
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,290
Your Highness.

96
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,850
The things you told me that night. Are they still in effect?

97
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,300
I told Your Highness to use me.

98
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,110
That's what I said. Are you going to use me?

99
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,710
Yes.

100
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,820
But please wait. Today is someone else's turn.

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,440
Your Highness.

102
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,600
I will go to Ming.

103
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:45,730
If I don't take responsibility as the proofreader of the document to Ming, it would be wrong as a loyal subject.
 (Gwon Geun, aka Yang Chon, Lee Sae's student) 

104
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,850
But something bad can happen to you as well.

105
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,570
That's the duty of someone in charge of the country's affairs,

106
00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:00,250
so I will escort Lord Sam Bong and go to Ming.

107
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,370
For Lord Sam Bong to clearly explain,

108
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,500
I will do my best to assist him.

109
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,520
Please give me your permission.

110
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,650
 Lord Sam Bong is being pushed into a corner. 

111
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:29,150
 By now, you won't be able to withstand, with your status and face scratched. 

112
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,110
 What are you going to do, Sam Bong? 

113
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,200
I mean Scholar Gwon Geun has volunteered to go himself, but

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
Lord Sam Bong just keeps on holding it up

115
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,820
and isn't saying anything.

116
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,120
Aigoo, seriously.

117
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,460
He can't even say himself that he will go

118
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,520
and he doesn't even appear at the meeting.

119
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,020
That's what I'm saying. Lord Sam Bong has to step forward and resolve it.

120
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,060
Lord Eo Eun (Min Je) and Lord Ha Ryun were talking so excitedly.

121
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,720
It's my first time seeing Ha Ryun talk so eagerly at the meeting.

122
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,360
He's famous for just looking and not talking at the meeting.

123
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,090
You must endure it.

124
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,220
You must not say that you're going to Ming.

125
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,650
My Lord, in front of the palace right now...

126
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,130
As the duty of a Confucian scholar, Teacher Sam Bong

127
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,830
must personally go to Ming and resolve this problem.

128
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,970
Please send Sam Bong to Ming.

129
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,290
Even Teacher Yang Chon has stepped forward,

130
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,870
so how can Teacher Sam Bong just stay like this without saying a thing?

131
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,370
Your Highness, please send Sam Bong.

132
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:04,500
- Your Highness, please send Sam Bong to Ming.
- Your Highness, please send Sam Bong to Ming.

133
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,730
Can you believe these people?

134
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,110
Lord, there's nothing to see here. Let's go.

135
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,100
 Your Highness, please send Sam Bong to Ming. 

136
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,310
Please give me your permission.

137
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,400
I will go to Ming.

138
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,820
You must not.

139
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,100
Your Highness.

140
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,080
- I said you must not!
- But, Your Highness.

141
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,380
It seems that you also

142
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,190
are just another human.

143
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,950
What do you mean?

144
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,180
It's hard to endure, right?

145
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,270
Getting criticized for protecting your life

146
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,360
is more shameful than death as a Confucian scholar.

147
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,290
You want to quit on everything, right?

148
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,770
I am the same.

149
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,310
After Po Eun died, what did you tell me?

150
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,660
I must endure. I have to do it.

151
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,120
You told me to endure the people's criticisms.

152
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,700
You told me to behead Po Eun and officially announce that he's a traitor.

153
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,540
If I want to take responsibility,

154
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,630
you told me to endure all those criticisms.

155
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,080
So you should endure it too, Sam Bong.

156
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,820
You must endure the criticisms saying you're a cheap and cowardly person.

157
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,730
Going to Ming

158
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,350
can be decided by anyone.

159
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,720
But the choice of someone in a high position, like you,

160
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,780
cannot be to succumb to these kind of criticisms.

161
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,010
Trying to strengthen our power after founding a new country

162
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,400
is a natural reason.

163
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,410
In the end, this is

164
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,530
a confrontation between Ming and the newly-established Joseon.

165
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
Don't you think so?

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,230
That is right.

167
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,850
That's why you have to endure it.

168
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,510
Are you not going to answer?

169
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,450
Your Majesty, I am moved to tears by your gratitude.

170
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,170
I

171
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,110
will accept your will

172
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,430
and endure it,

173
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,960
but this problem

174
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,340
will not just pass with me holding up.

175
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,120
Mal Saeng!

176
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,540
Have you been well?

177
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,430
Have you been well too, Your Highness?

178
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,370
I'll see you at home.

179
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,930
Are you related to this issue?

180
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,860
That Confucian scholar? Yes.

181
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,420
- I ordered him to do it.
- I'm talking about

182
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,970
the Ming pointing at me as the writer of the document to Ming.

183
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,940
What power do I have to move Ming?

184
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,710
Are you overestimating me?

185
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,910
Being pushed into a corner,

186
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,740
it seems that you're having nonsensical delusions.

187
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,490
Then...

188
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,700
Seeing you deny it,

189
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,700
it seems that you know that it's something that should not be done.

190
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,940
Is that not it?

191
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,300
Yes.

192
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,400
Regarding a powerful subject grasping the whole country in his hand

193
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,580
and controlling it as he wills,

194
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,830
I did talk to Ming ambassadors.

195
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,410
With Your Highness' personal powerâ€”

196
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,920
Your actions are politics

197
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,140
but the things I do are ulterior motives?

198
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,810
I was establishing diplomacy.

199
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,440
Causing the tension between Ming

200
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,770
was done by you.

201
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,490
To prevent a war, you made a new country,

202
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,930
but you keep training the soldiers nonstop.

203
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,980
That's provoking Ming.

204
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,740
The relationship being formed with the Ming, right now, will influence the next hundred years to come.

205
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,020
Diplomacy is about swords and wealth.

206
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,130
It sometimes requires swords and at times, wealth.

207
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,940
Diplomacy is the thing that keeps it going.

208
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,780
Your Highness did something to break that flow.

209
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Didn't you do it to keep your soldiers?

210
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,000
Didn't you just call your ulterior motive diplomacy?

211
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,520
Don't you have ulterior motives?

212
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,320
We all have our personal desires

213
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,420
and have a great cause with that desire as the base.

214
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,000
The winner's desire becomes the great cause.

215
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,330
Then,

216
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,340
I lost this time.

217
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,950
 What? You lost? 

218
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,540
Your Highness' merciless move

219
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,790
made me lose.

220
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,760
But I still

221
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,900
haven't placed my move yet.

222
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:43,350


223
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,570
I don't like you looking at me.

224
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,670
Still, watching over Your Highness

225
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,700
is my job.

226
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,940
When you set fire to Doomundong, you were confident.

227
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,210
It was the same when you killed Lord Po Eun, but

228
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,200
why are you being like this?

229
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,700
At that time, I didn't like you burning the village

230
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,950
but the image of Your Highness without a hint of shame or hesitation,

231
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,870
I liked it.

232
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,400
I understand. I'll quickly end it.

233
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,540
The scholar of the Department of Royal Records

234
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,460
Kwon Geun, Jeong Tak, and Noh In Do,

235
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,400
will go to Nanjing.

236
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,920
 Sam Bong... 

237
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,180
 The opposition must be severe so why? 

238
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,320
Your Highness.

239
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,720
If Lord Sam Bong, who was chosen by the Ming, will not go,

240
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,420
what explanation can they give?

241
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,660
That's right.

242
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,910
That's why I, Jeong Do Jeon,

243
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,100
Chief Minister of Personnel Affairs, Chief Minister of Finance,

244
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,590
Chief MInister of Regional Administration, Minister of State Affairs,

245
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,150
Chief Commander of the National Army

246
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,930
I will resign from all these government posts.

247
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,370
Since I've given up on all the power that I have,

248
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,200
Ming will not have any more misunderstanding.

249
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,700
Please give me your permission.

250
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,710
I give you permission.

251
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,050
 They have already talked about it. 

252
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:05,340
Resignation? Lord Sam Bong resigned from all his posts?

253
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,730
That's right. He has also let go of military power.

254
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,900
This is quite strange.

255
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,910
What could Lord Sam Bong and His Highness be thinking?

256
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:27,510
 I still haven't placed my move yet. 

257
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,140
You'd have to get dressed immediately to enter the palace.

258
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,240
Queen.

259
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,270
Your Highness.

260
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,430
Queen, please pull yourself together.

261
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,280
Look here, doctor. Do something!

262
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,990
Your Highness, please take my life.

263
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,300
Is Prince Jeong An not here yet?

264
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,850
Your Highness, our crown prince,

265
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,960
please protect him.

266
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,240
Prince Jeong An.

267
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,150
Come closer.

268
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,690
Mother.

269
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,660
Mother.

270
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:25,220
If there's something about me that upsets you, please shake it off.

271
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,070
What is there for me to be upset about?

272
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,830
Please protect our crown prince well.

273
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,070
 Crown Prince: Lee Bang Seok 

274
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:49,400
Your Highness, it's my last request.

275
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,860
Mother.

276
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,770
Don't worry.

277
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,020
Queen.

278
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,780
Mother! Mother!

279
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,930
Mother! Mother!

280
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,120
Mother! Mother!

281
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,640
Mother! Mother!

282
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,800
Mother! Mother!

283
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,290
Mother! Mother!

284
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,050
Mother!

285
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,270
Mother! Mother!

286
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,550
Mother!

287
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,740
Mother! Mother!

288
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,590
Mother! Mother!

289
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,730
Mother! Mother!

290
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,840
Her Highness the Queen.

291
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,540
Her Highness the Queen.

292
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,200
Her Highness the Queen.

293
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,810
Her Highness the Queen.

294
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,730
Her Highness the Queen.

295
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,860
Her Highness the Queen.

296
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,200
 Banchon 

297
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,300
We should get customers when the funeral ends.

298
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,620
They have to come. The funeral will end tomorrow.

299
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,370
Hey, Moo Hyul! You should stop doing Prince Jeong An's work.

300
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,240
Are you going to say that again? I'll be back.

301
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,590
That punk, seriously.

302
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm worried. It seems that the relationship between Prince Jeong An and Lord Sam Bong keeps getting worse.

303
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,290
It seems that our relationship is getting better.

304
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,970
I really ought to!

305
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,860
Geun Oh, take Myeong and go ahead.

306
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,830
Yes, Aunt. Let's go.

307
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:00,460


308
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,180
Why are you coming out of there?

309
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,300
Do you know who owns this storage?

310
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,480
This is my grandmother's.

311
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,460
Yes. I see.

312
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,740
But what about it?

313
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,150
Nothing.

314
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,220
You have a great responsibility Left Chief Minister.

315
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,010
While I'm away, please take care of the government.

316
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,220
Yes, Your Highness.

317
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,670
Please do not worry and be relaxed.

318
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,690
Please take care on your long journey.

319
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,720
Okay.

320
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,470
What about Sam Bong's whereabouts?

321
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,130
Noting yet.

322
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,300
 Where is he and what is he doing? 

323
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,500
Why are you so anxious these days?

324
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,800
I don't know why I'm like this either.

325
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,410
 What is Nameless doing? They're supposed to look for Sam Bong. 

326
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:21,450
His Highness will be leaving the capital and there's also no news about where Lord Sam Bong is.

327
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,220
You know about it, don't you?

328
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,380
No. I also don't know where he is.

329
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,180
How long has it been since he resigned? Where is he and what is he doing?

330
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,860
Why are you so concerned about Sam Bong?

331
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,200
Sam Bong left after resigning from all his posts.

332
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,030
He doesn't have any land or soldiers.

333
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,900
Even if he comes back and babbles about military reform, it's not going to work.

334
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,080
It didn't work even when he had eight government positions.

335
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,860
Sam Bong will find a stronger method.

336
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,790
What other method? If it were you, would you have another method?

337
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,990
Still, everything...

338
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:21,120
 If it were me, from the beginning I would... 

339
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,450
 Could it be... 

340
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,680
Spy?

341
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,940
Yes.

342
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,370
Ten or so people seeming to be spies boarded a ship going to the Mainland in Byeokrando.

343
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,750
Also, we saw ten or so spies crossing the Yalu River.

344
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:46,050
We couldn't find out more about Jeong Do Jeon because of Hwa Sa Dan and Lee Bang Ji.

345
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:51,440
The spies' movements are probably controlled by Sam Bong.

346
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,580
It's also been a while since we last saw Yeon Hee.

347
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,990
Mugeuk. There's news from Shimnyang.

348
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,960
What is it?

349
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,520
What kind of method will Sam Bong use?

350
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,090
No. That's silly.

351
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,150
Sam Bong is different from me.

352
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,930
I am someone who would move with even a 30% chance of possibility.

353
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,290
Yes. I know.

354
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,890
It was the same when you stamped the Anbyeon Chaek.

355
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,340
But looking at Sam Bong's temperament and position,

356
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,190
he is someone that needs at least 70% chance.of possibility.

357
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,130
So, what is it?

358
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,130
Probably, if it were me...

359
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,980
I would start a war in order to enact military reform.

360
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,390
But if it's Sam Bong-- I have something to check.

361
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:18,710
Oh, by the way, Miss Choon Joo at Mr. Oak's place.

362
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,700
She doesn't talk much and doesn't get along well with people,

363
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,550
but it seems like Moo Hyul knows her.

364
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,480
Really?

365
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,830
Leader! Someone came.

366
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:46,870
That red envelope that your member stole from Lord Sam Bong in Ganggye.

367
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,430
Why...

368
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,200
Did you look at it?

369
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,830
Did you see what's inside?

370
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,810
A person from Banchon  cannot say anything about political affairs.

371
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,200
I'm not asking you about the contents.

372
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,520
In the perspective of a leader trying to be neutral,

373
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,860
you obviously cannot tell me about that.

374
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Then...

375
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,260
I'm asking if you've seen the contents inside

376
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,890
or not. You can tell me that much.

377
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,380
That envelope was sealed.

378
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,290
If I opened it, it would be obvious.

379
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,930
I didn't open it.

380
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:47,240
It's not hard to open and close an envelope.

381
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,500
Thank you.

382
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,110
Pardon?

383
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,080
We're still the same.

384
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:10,480
I'm grateful as always and you still can't fool me.

385
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,990
You saw what's inside that envelope.

386
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,630
 Boon Yi (Banchon's Leader) 

387
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,620
Think of it as you like. I didn't see it.

388
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,520
 Bang Won is coming back. I'm a bit scared. 

389
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:04,230
 These can probably be dangerous weapons against each other. 

390
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,690
 Boon Yi saw it. She knows what's inside so she said it could be a dangerous weapon. 

391
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:15,160
 But if the contents are related to the Yeojin tribe, it couldn't be something dangerous. 

392
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,250
 There are  more secrets in that envelope. 

393
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,150
 Could it really be that? 

394
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,630
 But I still have doubts. 

395
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,950
Moo Hyul.

396
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,520
Prepare a horse.

397
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,090
Yes.

398
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,560
Where are you going?

399
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,590
You have found out where Father is, right?

400
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,700
Yes. My hidden sword is with His Highness.

401
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,530
A message gets sent every night. But why?

402
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,350
Teacher.

403
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,070
What if Sam Bong is planning to attack Liaodong in order to reform the military...

404
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,440
Pardon?

405
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,360
Prince Jeong An met Leader and asked about a red envelope.

406
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,500
Red envelope?
 (Jeong Do Gwang: Jeong Do Jeon's younger brother) 

407
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,260
 It's that document of bond. How could Prince Jeong Ahn..? 

408
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,970
 That's right. 

409
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:35,240
If they conquer Liaodong, then the military reform will be easy.

410
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,630
Since disobeying the command to go into battle will be treason,

411
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,280
there will be no way to avoid sending the private armies.

412
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:52,690
What's more, in the previous dynasty, Goryeo, the royal court wasn't capable of providing support to the private soldiers.

413
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,660
So even if the war ended,

414
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,620
they had no option but to return the private soldiers back to their owners.

415
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,910
Yes.

416
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:07,150
But this country has a strong government.

417
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:13,270
Without returning the soldiers back, they can be absorbed into the central army.

418
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,090
But

419
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,820
it's impossible.

420
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,050
Just to break up the private armies, he's going to conquer Liaodong?

421
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:32,820
Yes. That's why I still have questions.

422
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,600
A war with Ming doesn't even have a 30% chance of success.

423
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,090
Of course not.

424
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,070
Sam Bong isn't that reckless.

425
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,530
But what could that secret agreement with Mohenpa be?

426
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,990
I know. That's why I'm going crazy.

427
00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:01,120
I'd have to see Father. He has probably talked to Sam Bong about it.

428
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,710
Your Highness!

429
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,910
What if it's a fake play?

430
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,190
A fake play?

431
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:17,140
What if Sam Bong is using Liaodong conquest as a fake play to break up the private armies?

432
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:26,460


433
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,090
 The Liaodong conquest can just be stopped whenever, after pretending to do it. 

434
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:36,710
 The secret agreement with Mohenpa is a trick to hide that fake play. During the Wihwa Island retreat, 

435
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:41,170
 we couldn't cross the Yalu River, but the all of the armies were unified. 

436
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:47,960
 If this is Sam Bong's move, we'll be fooled without doing anything. 

437
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,700
Aren't you His Highness the Prince?

438
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,400
Your Highness.

439
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,230
- How did you know about His Highness' whereabouts?
- I came because I was worried.

440
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,990
- How is Father?
- His Highness,

441
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,860
during the day helps with public and private matters,

442
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,400
and he listens to Buddhist prayers all night long.

443
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,610
Father! This is Prince Jeong An!

444
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,750
His Highness said not to let anybody in.

445
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,410
Are you not going to move?

446
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,270
Monk, we have found Jeong Do Jeon's whereabouts.

447
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,010
-Right. Where is it?
-It's near this place.

448
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,590
He's in Gaegyeong. In the Royal Court.

449
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,260
What? The Royal Court?

450
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,660
Ddang Sae.

451
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,590
It's been a long time. You've worked hard.

452
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,980
You probably suffered while escorting Elder Bon Won.

453
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,460
- What's with your leg?
- It's nothing.

454
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,530
I'm fine.

455
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,930
I've been walking a lot.

456
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,070
- What about Elder Bon Won?
- He'll be here soon.

457
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,460
Do you like this work that much?

458
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,620
It's just...

459
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,560
I'm doing it with you

460
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,620
and I like it.

461
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,220
I've finished the task you've given me,

462
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,200
and I just came back, Bon Won.

463
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,290
It's been a long time.

464
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,410
You've worked hard.

465
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:54,600
Your and your Hwasadan spies have worked hard.

466
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,880
Now across the Yalu River and the Tumen River,

467
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,730
and Sanaegwan.

468
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,510
-All the preparation is done.
-Yes.

469
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,480
We analyzed the supply route and the march route.

470
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,090
We double checked the cooperation with Yeojin tribe.

471
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,020
The watchtowers, soldiers and horses,

472
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,530
military personnel and supplies are in good condition.

473
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:21,020
Right. We're starting now.

474
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,430
Move!

475
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,410
Father!

476
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,470
Where is Father?

477
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:07,500


478
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,690
It's been a while, Sam Bong.

479
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,630
I, Jeong Do Jeon,

480
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,970
To be able see your face like this again,

481
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,530
I am overwhelmed.

482
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,450
Me too. I'm really glad.

483
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,340
Lord Sam Bong.

484
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,700
Yes, General Lee Ji Ran.

485
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,210
You have looked down on me.

486
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,990
Tell me clearly. Where is Father?

487
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:02,190
I'm just following the royal command.

488
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,050
You!

489
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,830
I will not say anything.

490
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,030
He went to see Sam Bong.

491
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:26,010
That's probably it. He probably went to secretly meet Sam Bong.

492
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,430
Moo Hyul, let's go.

493
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,440
 Sam Bong is with Father. 

494
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,810
 By bringing about the Liaodong conquest as a fake play, 

495
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,370
 he will probably talk about the break up of the private armies. 

496
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,430
Your Highness!

497
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,300
I also didn't know.

498
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,050
Choong Gil fooled me and planned all this.
 (Lee Sook Beon) 

499
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,020
I don't doubt you.

500
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,840
Where did General Lee Ji Ran go?

501
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,880
Looking at the circumstances, I think he went with him.

502
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,350
Go back. I will contact you.

503
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,440
Where are you going?

504
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,830
I don't know. What should I do?

505
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,620
Your Highness. In front.

506
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,060
The elders wish to meet you immediately.

507
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,380
So you're Nameless. I've been wanting to see you anyway.

508
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,670
What is the matter?

509
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,300
I also have something to say.

510
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,700
Your Highness, I'm seeing you after a long time.

511
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,170
The voice in the palanquin.

512
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:30,420
Okay. Have you found out Sam Bong's whereabouts?

513
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,800
Yes. We found out that

514
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,550
Sam Bong is with His Highness at the Royal Court right now.

515
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:41,510
As expected. I'll meet them and I'll talk to you again.

516
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,640
This is urgent.

517
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,410
There's something else of greater importance.

518
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,620
Something more important?

519
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,790
Just what is more important than this?

520
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,170
You people,

521
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,070
just what organization are you?

522
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,290
You found out where Sam Bong is and what he's doing.

523
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:11,440
Did you know about it?

524
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,530
Right now, Sam Bong

525
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,410
is bringing out the Liaodong conquest as a fake play

526
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,960
and trying to finish the break up of the private armies.

527
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,440
Right now, my brothers and I

528
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,490
will have our soldiers taken

529
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:29,880
and will become puppets.

530
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,800
Is there something more important than this?

531
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,640
Yes. It's more important.

532
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,930
- What is it? 
- For the break up of the private armies

533
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,460
Sam Bong's fake play.

534
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,690
Now that fake play

535
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,740
is no longer just a fake play.

536
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,630
It's no longer a

537
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:01,930
fake play? 
 - Yes, that is right, Your Majety.

538
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,140
Look here, recorder.

539
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,850
You must write it down exactly.

540
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,110
We are in a priceless moment in history.

541
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,530
Just what are you talking about?

542
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,610
Are you really

543
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:28,280
saying we should attack Liaodong instead of using it bait for the breakup of private armies?

544
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,550
Are you saying we should seriously attack Liaodong?

545
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,010
- That is right, Your Highness.
- Sam Bong.

546
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,040
After overcoming a great feat on Wihwa Island...

547
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,430
It's a different situation than before.

548
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,700
The season is different, the stocked up military sustenance is different.

549
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,880
After the disposition training, the military power will also

550
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,860
be different, both quality wise and quantity wise.

551
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,570
That's not the only difference.

552
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:58,080
Unlike the Liaodong from before, right now the Ming's influence is a lot greater.

553
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,750
But you want to attack Liaodong?

554
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,640
One more important situation has changed.

555
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,270
What has changed?

556
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:11,550
Yeon Hee, tell them about the information report you have.

557
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,860
We have received two new pieces of information.

558
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:24,420
First one, the envoy that went to the Mings, Kim Yak Hyang, No In Do, Jeong Chong,

559
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,400
these three people have been executed.

560
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,810
What?

561
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,040
What?

562
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,560
Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang), that bastard.

563
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,690
How can he do this?

564
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,660
The second thing...

565
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,510
Continue.

566
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,740
Yes, Your Highness.

567
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:47,460
For the second one, today all the fastest messengers were involved and

568
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,580
urgent information  has arrived.

569
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,100
It's news from Nanjing.

570
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,350
Nanjing?

571
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,950
 Just what has happened? 

572
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,900
Ju Won Jang's (Zhu Yuanzhang) days are numbered.

573
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:09,940
Ju Won Jang will die soon?

574
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,600
Yes. If Ju Won Jang dies now,

575
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,870
what do you think will happen in the Mainland?

576
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:21,810
How serious is his condition?

577
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:26,350
We won't be able to tell for sure, since it's the work of the heavens.

578
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:31,030
But it would be half a year at most.

579
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:39,000
The shortest time could be a month. He might even be dead by now.

580
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,800
Hyungnim, if this is true...

581
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,620
Your Highness, the next person to the throne is his grandson, Ju Yoon Mun (Zhu Yunwen).

582
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,860
He's just became an adult at 21 years of age.

583
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,880
But Ju Won Jang's sons, in each location,

584
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,640
are raising strong forces as the kings of each region.

585
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,280
A civil war will happen soon. Is that what you're saying?

586
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,280
That's right.

587
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,420
Now the Mainland won't be able to avoid a great casualty of war.

588
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,510
For the past few years, I have reformed the military system

589
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,690
and strengthened the castle walls and stocked up on military suppies.

590
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:26,410
I thought of Liaodong conquest as having less than a 30% chance of success.

591
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,720
That's right.

592
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,260
For Ju Won Jang's grandson to become the emperor,

593
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,380
we thought he would get rid of everything that would be a threat to his grandson.

594
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,320
But Ju Won Jang is dying?

595
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,500
Yes, Your Highness. The situation has changed.

596
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:50,640
Then, King Ju Che (Zhu Di), who is in charge of Liaodong...

597
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,420
What will happen to King Ju Che?

598
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,060
When Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) dies, Ju Yoon Mun (Zhu Yunwen) will ascend the throne

599
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,960
and will immediately get rid of Ju Che (Zhu Di).

600
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,680
But do you think Ju Che will just stay still and be attacked like that?

601
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,540
If Ju Che leads his army to Nanjing in order to take back the throne,

602
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,620
Jeong Do Jeon will probably

603
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,790
think of marching onto Liaodong immediately.

604
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,320
 Namgyeong (Nanjing): Ming's capital 

605
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,480
If that happens, a break up of private armies won't be the only problem.

606
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,680
The soldiers will naturally be abolished.

607
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,080
The princes will be placed into each division and forced to fight in battle.

608
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:45,840
If that happens, you will be placed a situation of life or death.

609
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:51,500
But there are probably Ming's people active in our country too.

610
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,660
So even knowing our war preparations,

611
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:58,350
will they be able to send armies to Nanjing that easily?

612
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:05,660
If that doesn't happen, I will give up any plans I have for Liaodong.

613
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,700
But Your Majesty, according to Hwasadan's information,

614
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,990
the probability of Ju Che marching to Nanjing is more than 70%.

615
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,870
Seventy percent.

616
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:21,170
We're looking at 70%.

617
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:22,740
No.

618
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,620
80%.

619
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:32,860
No. It will be more than 90%.

620
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:41,770
Ju Che (Zhu Di) will surely make a move.

621
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,890
Surely move?

622
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,600
Your Highness.

623
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:56,610
I don't know for sure. But in that short time I came to know Ju Che.

624
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:02,130
He seemed to be very sharp and decisive in making decisions.

625
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:11,210
Between Liaodong and the Central Plain, his choice will be very clear.

626
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,630
It's that.

627
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:20,620
Ju Che will abandon Liaodong and will surely

628
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,970
go to Nanjing with an army of 200,000.

629
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,500
Your Majesty, for those of us who have lived in the Three Han Kingdoms for a long time,

630
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,420
this is a heavenly opportunity that won't come for another 1000 years.

631
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,740
More than any other time, the success rate is higher.

632
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,220
Even if we succeed, the problem is what happens after.

633
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:49,800
Ju Che will end up taking control of the Mainland.

634
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,150
And if that happens, will he approve of a foreign country

635
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,100
taking control of a strategically important location like Liaodong?

636
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,830
If Ju Yoon Mun (Zhu Yunwen) and Ju Che (Zhu Di) go into a civil warâ€”

637
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:04,830
Looking at it geographically or by their military forces, it's not possible to end in a short amount of time.

638
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,070
We can take over Liaodong

639
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,960
and make aa agreement with Ju Che about reinforcing it.

640
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,120
We can just stabilize Liaodong.

641
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,990
Ju Che will end it in a short time, and won't try to take our reinforcements.

642
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:20,360
So Your Majesty, when Ju Che marches south onto Nanjing,

643
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,630
we have to make preparations to be able to immediately march north at the same time.

644
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:29,500
This country will take Liaodong.

645
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,350
Even if we secure Liaodong,

646
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,690
to protect that land, the state treasury will be emptied out

647
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,810
and as a consequence, this country, this land of Three Han

648
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,330
might breakdown.

649
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:45,390
Your Highness, you must stop this war.

650
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,750
Your Majesty, please give permission for this war

651
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,930
and break the 1000-year history of us serving them.

652
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,190
Not persecuting the people on the inside,

653
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,480
and not submitting to the strong on the outside,

654
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,000
Please make a new country and new history.

655
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,630
We must stop this war

656
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,500
and save this country, Your Highness!

657
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:17,970
 It was this. The truth behind my anxiety and uneasiness. 

658
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:52,500
