 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,240
 The person I'm going to serve as my lord 

3
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,220
 is linked to him by blood, that Pok Doo that's hard to control. 

4
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,330
 According to military strategies, 

5
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,630
 if you want the commander to collapse,  then aim for his horse first. 

6
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,960
 Teacher Sam Bong, my place in that cave, 

7
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,670
 please take care of it well. I will surely come back to it. 

8
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,710
 The An Byeon Chaek wasn't sent by Lee Seong Gye. 

9
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,250
 His son, Lee Bang Won, stamped it with his father's seal and forged it. 

10
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,140
 Lee Bang Won? 

11
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,500
 So, things have become more difficult. 

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,670
 Now, Lee In Gyeom will counterattack. 

13
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,300
Lee Bang Won, Lee Bang Won!

14
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,640
Did you suddenly think of a good idea?

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,600
Have you thought about the thing that is the hardest to understand in this whole palace?

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,640
How is it that Lee Seong Gye's An Byeon Book

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,500
was favored by Hong In Bang and Gil Tae M? It was this.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
You've pinpointed it.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,320
Now, I will make people understand  that.

20
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,270
What is that?

21
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,780
I-It's nothing.

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,740
Nothing? You're face suddenly went pale. What is it that you're being like that?

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,860
Through the An Byeon Book, the tax revenue of the now secured Northeastern side

24
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,910
will be divided between Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi, and Lee Seong Gye

25
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,990
in a secret agreement?

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,920
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

27
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,320
It's only an anonymous letter. There isn't any basis for it, either.

28
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,550
 No, no. It couldn't be. 

29
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,560
Lee Seong Gye is not that kind of person. Certainly.

30
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,120
Pan Yi Bu Sa,
 (Pan Yi Bu Sa: a government post name) 

31
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,520
I need to ask for a favor.

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,170
Yes. Please speak.

33
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,950
General!

34
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,670
I... have something I want to consult with you about.

35
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,650
What is it, Pan Yi Bu Sa?

36
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,690
Have you heard about the stories going around now?

37
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,430
Are you talking about the anonymous letter that nobody  can confirm?
 (Choi Yeong) 

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,420
You have to read this.

39
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:06,150
I want to tell you that a series of letters like this shouldn't be overlooked.

40
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,880
Isn't it strange?

41
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,580
If the contents of that letter aren't true, then just why

42
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,570
would you, Gil Tae Mi and Hong In Bang, vote in favor of the An Byeon Book when you have a really bad relationship with Lee Seong Gye?

43
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,170
That's definitely because,after stabilizing the Northeastern side  (Woo Hak Joo) ,

44
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,230
there will be a strong defense.

45
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,390
Ah, so that was it.

46
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,540
For the stability of the Northeastern side?

47
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,860
But during the last Do Dang meeting, what did you say?

48
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,890
"Is Lee Seong Gye the only one protecting the country?" Didn't you say that?

49
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,600
That is...

50
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,550
Look here. Seung Rok Dae Bu!
 (Seung Rok Dae Bu: a government official during the Goryeo era) 

51
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,450
Kwa Jeuk...Mul Tan Gae? 
(Kwa Jeuk Mul Tan Gae: Not hesitating to immediately fix what you did wrong)
(Gil Tae Mi) 

52
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,050
There's a saying like this!

53
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,670
According to Jung Yong! Jung Yong!
 (Jung Yong: Doctrine of the Mean, one of the 4 Books of Confucian texts) 

54
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,160
Non Eo.
 (Non Eo: Analects, one of the four books) 

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,450
Non Eo. According to Non Eo!

56
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,290
It means that a superior person should not be afraid of fixing what he did wrong.

57
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,800
But right now, I am showing you my image as a superior person.

58
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
What is wrong with that?

59
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,810
Ah, seriously.

60
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,890
Did I really say that?

61
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,770
Anyway, there was an uproar at the royal palace because of this so we need to investigate.

62
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,890
Investigate? What investigation do you need?

63
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,360
What?
 (He spoke informally to someone older than him.) 

64
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,230
What? You bastard!

65
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,240
-Bastard? Bastard?
-What, you bastard?

66
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,190
- I ought to just--
- Bastard? Why?

67
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,730
Hey, you bastard!

68
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,810
Stop!

69
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,630
Prime Minister.

70
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,440
Me?

71
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,970
A few days ago, your son got nominated as a Gam Chang Gwan in the Northeastern region.

72
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,560
 Gam Chang Gwan: an official rank given to someone who inspects tax and warehouses 

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,060
What are you saying? It's something that I didn't know.

74
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,350
There's a written certification like this and you're still denying it?

75
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,550
 Go Gong Chong Rang Gil Yoo has been appointed as a Northeastern region tax and warehouse inspector. 

76
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,570
If it's the Gam Chang Gwan, then isn't that the one who inspects taxes in the Northeaster region?

77
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,870
How could this be!

78
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,510
Even with this, are you still going to say that you didn't have a secret agreement with Lee Seong Gye?

79
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,080
Then, it is true...

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,300
 - It's true?
- How could this be? 

81
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,330
 It's that position too. 

82
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,490
Okay, okay, okay.

83
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,060
Although it is anonymous,

84
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,650
since some of the Do Dang members have spoken up about their will,

85
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm thinking of going through with the investigation...
 (Lee In Gyeom) 

86
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,240
My Lord!

87
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,070
If Gil Yoo has really been appointed as a tax inspector,

88
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,320
this series of circumstances is enough to be suspicious.

89
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,580
Do you really think that General Lee Seong Gye is that kind of person...
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

90
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,890
No. Do you think he's someone who would do that?

91
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,400
Lord.

92
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,200
Didn't we already witness the unpleasant crumbling of heroes many times?

93
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,520
It's just a groundless rumor.

94
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,900
 It's a rumor, just a rumor. But in that rumor, General Lee Seong Gye 

95
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,820
 will get the most fatal blow. 

96
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,440
It is indeed fatal. Integrity...

97
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,710
He is attacking Lee Seong Gye's biggest weapon, his integrity.

98
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,550
Yes. As is expected of Lee In Gyeom.

99
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,140
I need to go to Ham Joo. I need to meet General Lee Seong Gye.

100
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,310
A report came in saying that Lee Shin Jeok is coming to Gaegyeong by Lee Seong Gye's order.

101
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,110
Please decide after meeting him first. He'll be here soon.

102
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,310
 Just what are you saying? 

103
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,340
It's as you heard, Hyung-nim.

104
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,440
So, at a time like this when the war with Ho Bal Do has started, you came here to Gaegyeong?
 (Lee Bang Woo) 

105
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,210
Yes. I already relayed the message and was about to go back immediately, but you were scolding me.
 (Lee Bang Gwa) 

106
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,130
Then immediately withdraw the An Byeon Book, give the documents to the Do Dang, and go back to Ham Joo.

107
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,250
But Hyung-nim.

108
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,760
Is withdrawing the An Byeon Book right, or...

109
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,250
Whether it is right or wrong, Father has already decided. We can just follow him.

110
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,710
He is our father but he is also the leader of the Ga Byeol Cho.
 (Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army.) 

111
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,680
It's what we have to do according to our military discipline.

112
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,630
How could you also be played by Bang Won's lies?

113
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,460
Where are you going? Where are you going that you're packing you're stuff?

114
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,480
Ham Joo.

115
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,830
Ham Joo?

116
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,750
To take responsibility.

117
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,160
You said that being an adult is taking responsibility.
 (Lee Bang Won) 

118
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,350
Withdrawing the An Byeon Book?

119
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,330
Lee Bang Gwa has the documents to withdraw the An Byeon Book and he has arrived in Gaegyeong.

120
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,740
Where is Lee Bang Won's house? Lead me there.

121
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,410
What are you going to do?

122
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,350
Gyo Ui Lee is going to Lee Bang Won's house, right? First, we have to stop him.

123
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,290
In the end, there's a sequence to giving up. It has to be that way to allow the next move.

124
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,810
Hey, I'm fine with you going wherever, but you have to tell me where ajussi is before you go.

125
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,690
 Young Master! 

126
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,850
Did you come from Ham Joo?

127
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,010
Ah, there's a big problem. The general told me to catch you immediately.
 (Jo Young Gyu) 

128
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,950
Like your legs will get clubbed... Like, really! Well, it's that kind of atmosphere.

129
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,210
I'm already on my way to Ham Joo anyway.

130
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,580
I'll go and settle things.

131
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,550
Aigoo, I should've stopped him back then. What kind of hard work is this when the An Byeon Book will be withdrawn anyway...

132
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,540
What did you say?

133
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,500
Young Master Bang Gwa came with me.

134
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,380
He has the documents to withdraw the An Byeon Book.

135
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,230
You bastard!

136
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,390
No matter how young and foolish you are, how could you behave in such an immature manner?

137
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,550
Everything is my fault. Still, how could you withdraw the An Byeon Book?

138
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,660
That will not do.

139
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,000
I will go to Ham Joo and receive my punishment, whatever it is.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,890
You must not withdraw it, Hyung-nim!

141
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,860
This bastard still cannot clear his head.

142
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,100
There's an execution in this mountain-like work.

143
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,350
Did you see the Ga Byeol Cho and Northeastern region that you rattled?

144
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,450
Go to Ham Joo and accept your punishment. You will be on detention.

145
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,880
Hurry and go to the Do Dang. Hand over the documents of withdrawal to them.

146
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes, Hyung-nim.

147
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,310
Hyung-nim! You must not do this.

148
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,690
Please hold on to it for just a bit. I will meet Father and I can persuade him.

149
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,860
Please wait.

150
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,760
Bang Won, you bastard!

151
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,020
What are the police doing here?

152
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,710
Is General Lee Seong Gye's fifth son, Lee Bang Won here?

153
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,310
He is but why are you looking for him?

154
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,670
He is being charged of having illegal dealings with Head of Seonggyungwan, Hong In Bang, to get the An Byeon Book approved.

155
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,560
Arrest him!

156
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,300
Yes!

157
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,550
It is you, Hap Ha.

158
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,840
In thinking of your next step regarding Head of Seonggyungwan, Hong In Bang,
 (Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan Owner) 

159
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,840
you must be busy.

160
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,640
That's why you called on to your Jang Goon.
 (Jang Goon: General, a chess piece) 

161
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,620
I...

162
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,530
I didn't call my General for Hong In Bang.

163
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,410
What?

164
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,180
Then for whom?

165
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,610
I think Hong In Bang is just being controlled.

166
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,520
Then, is Lee Seong Gye standing behind Hong In Bang?

167
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,900
No.

168
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,860
A glimmering shadow behind Lee Seong Gye and Hong In Bang...

169
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,920
I've sent the General to that shadow.

170
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,590
Even if you meet with Gyo Ui Lee, how will you block the documents?

171
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,340
Isn't that Bang Won?

172
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,880
The shadow behind Lee Seong Gye.

173
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,450
Can you see and receive it this time?

174
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:10,010
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

175
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,810
We can gain four things from just this one happening.

176
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,680
First, if the arrested Bang Won, in the middle of being tortured,

177
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,650
has something bad happen to him,

178
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,840
the forging of the An Byeon Book documents will be buried.

179
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,410
What?

180
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,510
Second, if that happens, Lee Seong Gye and Lee In Gyeom

181
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,020
will have already crossed a river of no return.

182
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:54,190
Lee Seong Gye will be standing in the position you wanted him in.

183
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,510
Then, third. The thing you are worried about, Bon Won,

184
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,390
that serious Pok Doo,

185
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,780
will be naturally solved.

186
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,070
So are you just going to watch over this situation?
 (Lee Shin Jeok) 

187
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,050
Are you just going to let a person without sin be tortured to death?

188
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,100
Sin and death have never been related to begin with.

189
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,490
You don't die because you have sinned

190
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,260
and you don't live because you have no sins.

191
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,090
In this country, has any death

192
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,810
been related to sin?

193
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,130
What? This wench is wholeheartedly wishing ill upon others!

194
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,740
We are all gathered to change that kind of country!

195
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,210
Elder Bon Won, this must never happen.

196
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,460
Let's say that Bang Won did something wrong.

197
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,480
Even so, you can't sacrifice him to this kind of conspiracy.

198
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,940
I only follow Elder Bon Won's will.

199
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,140
I will follow your decision.

200
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,490
 Bug. A bug. 

201
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,310
 A bug has finally started crawling in my mind. 

202
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,540
 No, it was from the moment I saw Lee Bang Won arrested. 

203
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,990
 What Yeon Hee said was right. 

204
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,990
 If I let Lee Bang Won be tortured to death, 

205
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,000
 the many things that came to be might get easily and swiftly be resolved. 

206
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,500
 I can just turn my head away for a bit. 

207
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,430
 In that smooth-sailing process, 

208
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,560
 how many people need to die? 

209
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,530
 That's a process we need to go through. 

210
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,220
 Every great cause is followed by hardship. 

211
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,640
 Taking responsibility. 

212
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,530
 I've already prepared myself for that. 

213
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,090
 It's a bug. A bug.
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon) 

214
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,650
 But... 

215
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,460
We have to save Young Master Bang Won!

216
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,920
We need to do something, whatever it is.

217
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,220
Hurry and send the documents to cancel everything, okay?

218
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,810
Give them to me.

219
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,830
What are you going to do?

220
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,170
I will not send this.

221
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,610
- Hyung-nim!
- This is how Lee In Gyeom

222
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,140
is proclaiming war against our family.

223
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,300
The Ga Byeol Cho doesn't avoid war!

224
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,370
Hyung-nim.

225
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,690
You two command the Gaegyeong Ga Byeol Cho

226
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,010
and be ready and in position.

227
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,500
- Yes, Hyung-nim.
- Yes!

228
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,750
I will go to Ham Joo, report the situation to Father,

229
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,990
and receive a strict military command.

230
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,120
 He is being charged with illegal dealing with Head of Seonggyungwan Hong In Bang to get the An Byeon Book approved. 

231
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,280
 Hong In Bang... 

232
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,730
You met?

233
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,580
Yes. That night when I got attacked,

234
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,270
it is true that Lee Bang Won came to me.
 (Hong In Bang) 

235
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,450
We didn't have a secret agreement but there's also no evidence of that.

236
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,620
What's the use of evidence?

237
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,690
If Lee Bang Won confesses, then that would be the evidence.

238
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,720
How can such a young kid endure police torture?

239
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,320
Let's kill him.

240
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,230
Lee Bang Won...

241
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,110
If he dies,

242
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,940
we might be suspected, but

243
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,310
so what?

244
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,090
Let's kill him!

245
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,340
Elder Hong In Bang!

246
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,910
Elder Hong In Bang!

247
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,790
It's an important matter. You have to see me, Elder!

248
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,610
 Father! 

249
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,370
 Un Nyeon, no! 

250
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,110
You!

251
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,520
Crazy wench, you came here on your own!

252
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,790
After meeting with the Elder, what will you do?

253
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,660
Let go of this! Let go!

254
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,820
Follow me.

255
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,050
- Follow me.
- What's going on?

256
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,390
Elder, this wench is the mastermind of the Western district village.

257
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,390
She came here on her own.

258
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,810
Transfer her to the government office.

259
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,220
Young Master Lee Bang Won...

260
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,660
I was sent here by Young Master Lee Bang Won.

261
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,280
What happened on that night... I knew about it.
 (Boon Yi) 

262
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,330
Bang Won sent you?

263
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,080
Actually, I wasn't sent by Young Master Bang Won.

264
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,830
I came here to meet you.

265
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,110
That night, there wasn't a secret agreement,

266
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,840
but I know that you said that you will join hands with General Lee Seong Gye.

267
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,920
So?

268
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,400
Then, you should have prevented it!

269
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,400
That's...

270
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,760
what Young Master Bang Won would probably think.

271
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,040
I came instead of him.

272
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,020
If something bad happens to Young Master Bang Won while he's being tortured,

273
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,910
can't you to predict what General Lee Seong Gye will do?

274
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,990
The time is limited!

275
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,070
You have to save Young Master Bang Won fast!

276
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,490
There's no reason for Lee In Gyeom to kill Bang Won.

277
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,950
He only wants to hear Lee Seong Gye's confession.

278
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,390
Even so,

279
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,080
in the investigation office,

280
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,460
we don't know what might happen in the middle of torture.

281
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,540
How can you be calm like this?

282
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,200
You're passionate.

283
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,780
What's you're relationship with Bang Won?

284
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,320
What relationship do you have with him that you, a girl from the Western district,

285
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,060
would come running here on your own when you could be caught and killed?

286
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,750
So what is your reason for passionately asking that Bang Won be saved?

287
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,480
Could it be

288
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,490
that you and Bang Won...

289
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,700
He bought shoes

290
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,370
- for me.
- What?

291
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,340
A certain nobleman kills us

292
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,960
but Young Master bought me shoes.

293
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,730
I will do something

294
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,550
so meet Bang Won and tell him this.

295
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,330
You know, I

296
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,430
am someone who renounced my belief as soon as I entered the investigation office.

297
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,370
But that bastard, Bang Won,

298
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,190
always said that is different than I am.

299
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,920
But he must never mention my name

300
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,190
or his father's name in a confession.

301
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,070
If our names come up,

302
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,880
everything that you are worried about will happen.

303
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,840
 Is it Ap Seul? 

304
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,110
 Ap Seul: a method of torture that presses the knees using a heavy object. 

305
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,930
 Is it fire torture? Or torturing by hitting my body? 

306
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,880
 If they hit me, the bones in my knees will be broken 

307
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,390
 and I won't be able to walk again. 

308
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,340
 If I get out of here alive, 

309
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,940
 how will I look? 

310
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,650
You are here because of the charge against you saying you had illegal dealings with Hong In Bang.

311
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,590
The torture will continue until you confess to that.

312
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,980
There was no secret agreement of any kind.

313
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,470
Let's start.

314
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,930
Yes.

315
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,120
 Before flying, 

316
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,500
 there's no way of knowing if I am a chicken or a bird 

317
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,760
 Lee Bang Won, you punk. 

318
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,600
 This time, you have to withstand it! Endure! 

319
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,910
 I am not a chicken. 

320
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,830
You have to come out fast!

321
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,220
Yes, I understand.

322
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,470
This way.

323
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Hey, Lee Bang Won!

324
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,530
Hey!

325
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,200
How did you...

326
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,060
Are you okay?

327
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,660
Do you think I'm okay?

328
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,410
How did you get in here?

329
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,700
First, eat.

330
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,550
How did you get in?

331
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,760
Hong In Bang sent me in.

332
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,360
You met Hong In Bang?

333
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,800
He asked me to give you a message.

334
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,290
Say it.

335
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,360
He said that as soon as he went to the investigation office he renounced his belief,

336
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,820
but you always said that you are different from him.

337
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,620
So?

338
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,710
"So,

339
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,370
never mention

340
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,110
my name or you father's name."

341
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,160
Of course not.

342
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,780
I shouldn't become like Hong In Bang.

343
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,470
That's right, Hang in there.

344
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,390
Enduring it will be the wisest thing to do.

345
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,250
Ajussi will quickly make a way.

346
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,500
Teacher Sam Bong

347
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,010
wishes

348
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,060
me to die.

349
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,820
What nonsense are you saying?

350
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,970
If I die,

351
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,050
the forging of the An Byeon Book will be naturally covered up.

352
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:44,470
Then, Father will be Lee In Gyeom's opponent.

353
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,010
A big nuisance like me will also be taken care of.

354
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,690
Impossible.

355
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,370
You are being like that because ajussi scolded you.

356
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,170
Ajussi will save you and resolve this situation and everything else.

357
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,580
He will find a way to do that.

358
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,610
 Will he really do that? 

359
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,490
 Will that person really do that? 

360
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,150
You have to hurry and come out now.

361
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,040
Yes, I understand.

362
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,280
I'm going.

363
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,450
Don't lose hope.

364
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,480
Also, smile.

365
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,280
You should smile first.

366
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,900
Do you know why I like you?

367
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,150
Because I don't think you will die.

368
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,650
I don't think you will leave me.

369
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,510
You like me?

370
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,630
I won't die.

371
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,900
I will definitely live and get out.

372
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,970
Just wait.

373
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,260
 Don't die. 

374
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,230
 I don't want to see someone leaving me again. 

375
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,000
 I won't even think about it. 

376
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,290
 Brother and mother. 

377
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,560
 I forgot about them. 

378
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,600
 Don't you forget. 

379
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,160
Did you meet Bang Won?

380
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,940
- Yes.
- What did he say?

381
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,820
Where is ajussi?

382
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,380
I have to see him. I have something to say.

383
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,430
You're not a contact anymore.

384
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,130
How can a member act like that without permission?

385
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,830
Please let me see him for the last time.

386
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,240
- Grandmother!
- Aigoo, this guy!

387
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,000
Moo Hyul! Hey! What happened?
 (Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's Grandmother) 

388
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,840
Have you already caught the Viper?

389
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
I caught a better one!

390
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,400
A better one?

391
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,180
Could it be that you

392
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,890
caught Gil Tae Mi?

393
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,440
No.

394
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,730
 (Moo Hyul) 

395
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,360
I got General Lee Seong Gye.

396
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,220
You crazy bastard. This rotten bastard!

397
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,810
Hey, you bastard. Goryeo's hero,

398
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,530
General Lee Seong Gye. Are you saying you killed him?

399
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,590
This ridiculous bastard! Hey, get me the broom!

400
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,910
He's going on with this nonsense...

401
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,930
No, no.

402
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:19,450
I saved General Lee Seong Gye's son's life twice.

403
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,350
That's why I am now a second rank Buk Doo body guard.

404
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,050
Second rank Buk Doo body guard?

405
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,290
What is Buk Doo body guard? Why is it second rank?

406
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,160
Oh? Why is that swindler here?

407
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,770
Hyung, our household got a servant!

408
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,570
What servant!

409
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,680
What happened? Why is that person here?

410
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,040
That person...

411
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,550
Do you think I would just let that person who swindled our family leave unscathed?

412
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,590
So I went and gave him trouble!

413
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,100
I told him to take out everything that he has taken from our family.

414
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,780
That's why he's cutting costs with manual labor like that, every day.

415
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,880
Ah, Noonim! What cutting costs.

416
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,850
To a dignified person... He's deducting it! That's how you say it.

417
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,650
Noonim?

418
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,470
Ah, right. Now that we are living in the same house, while thinking of the age order,

419
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,360
I arranged a title for her.

420
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,470
- That's why...
- Ah! Forget it! Forget it! Anyway!

421
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,350
Grandmother, our hardship has ended now.

422
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,360
General Lee Seong Gye's eldest son told me to bring my whole family to Gaegyeong.

423
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,740
We have all become part of the Ga Byeol Cho!
 (Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army.) 

424
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,920
Ga Byeol Cho?

425
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,060
Our whole family to Gaegyeong?

426
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,510
So, our whole family. So what you're saying is we became part of the Ga Byeol Cho and we're going to Gaegyeong? Finally?

427
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,670
That's what I said!

428
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,270
Aigoo! Our Moo Hyul!

429
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,750
Hey!

430
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,180
Our Moo Hyul did it!

431
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,870
Our family is going but why are you the one who's happy?
 (Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master) 

432
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,420
This Noonim said I am a swindler and spread the rumor in the neighborhood.

433
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,140
I don't have a way to survive in this neighborhood!

434
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,790
That's why you have to take responsibility for me.

435
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,130
Responsibility? Responsibility, my foot.

436
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,670
You swindled our family for a long time. What are you saying?

437
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,190
I've never swindled you!

438
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,070
Hong Ryun, Gil Tae Mi, Gil Sun Mi, I trained them all!

439
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,220
In that cold winter, with my hands trembling.

440
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,690
Why are you holding on to that again?

441
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,550
Moo Hyul.

442
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,480
Noonim! I'm... in pain.

443
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,340
You have to be responsible for me.

444
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,890
Servant Hong! Move.

♫  Yallari Yalla  

473
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,280
This is not the time to be like this.

474
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,660
Have you found out anything about the Viper?

475
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,800
Yes. When he was young, he lost his mother to the nobles

476
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,520
and it appears that he was enraged by that.

477
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,360
He's not someone who would go under your control.

478
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,790
Just end your relationship with him like this.

479
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,270
 He's a pitiful child. 

480
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,790
 Please let him go so that he doesn't get carried away anymore. 

481
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:32,170
Elder! The situation has become urgent.

482
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,570
If he can't endure the torture, Lee Bang Won's mouth

483
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,210
will mention his father's or Hong In Bang's name.

484
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,380
If even your name is mentioned, Elder Bon Won,

485
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,760
everything that you have planned all this time will become nothing by morning.

486
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,540
If you allow me, I will infiltrate the investigation office.

487
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,520
A person being tortured in the investigation office and dying inside the prison is a common thing.

488
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,900
You don't have to do anything.

489
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,770
You just have to turn away for a bit.

490
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,820
That girl from the Western district wants to meet you, Elder Bon Won.

491
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,150
- Boon Yi has come to Gaegyeong?
- That's right.

492
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:28,160
She helped Lee Bang Won in Ham Joo and she followed him.

493
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,170
So I kept her out last night.

494
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,770
A person came into an organization and acted independently. You need to remove her.

495
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,240
Why are you being like that?

496
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,030
Have I ever told you that girl's name?

497
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,750
I have told you about my connection to that girl, but

498
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,020
I don't think I mentioned her name.

499
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,920
Actually,

500
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,150
I know her.

501
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,800
How?

502
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,580
When I was young, I also came from the Western district.

503
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,230
I hope that you don't say anything to Boon Yi.

504
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,710
Also, please do not ask me about the story behind it.

505
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,120
 My brother left then and there was also no news regarding Unni Yeon Hee. 

506
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,650
 Could that Yeon Hee have been you? 

507
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,710
Where in Goryeo can you find a person without a story? I will not ask you.

508
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,250
Where is Boon Yi?

509
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,800
 At a time when the people are dying of hunger, there was a secret agreement regarding tax revenues! 

510
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,450
 We will clearly expose what is true and what is not. 

511
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,060
 We will clearly expose it! 

512
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:54,210
Even the students are like this, I

513
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,430
cannot reject an investigation.

514
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,400
But you already caught and tortured an innocent Lee Bang Won, so that should do. What else do you want? You can't even make him confess!

515
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,390
If that young child is innocent to that extent, don't you think he would confess in that scary place?

516
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,900
Yes. It's either that he can't trust his conviction

517
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,020
or that he trusts Lee Seong Gye with everything.

518
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,970
Is Lee Seong Gye someone who would accept an offer like that?

519
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,030
I only voted in favor of the An Byeon Book because it will be a great help to Goryeo's defense.

520
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:33,060
Of course, it's also because I wanted to be in a higher position than you in this political war.

521
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,490
But there was no such thing as a secret agreement.

522
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,980
That's why I am going to do an investigation.

523
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,620
What's the use of saying whether there was a secret agreement or not here?

524
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:50,390
But how can we trust that investigation?

525
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,400
There's one person in the investigation office, like a  Byek Chang Ho.
 (Byeok Chang Ho: A stubborn person who you can't communicate with) 

526
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,250
Ah, you're talking about the dumb-head stranger, right?

527
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,870
Ah, that person? Fine.

528
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,140
That person previously

529
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,750
raised an appeal to kick me out.

530
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,420
It will be okay if we assign that person to investigate.

531
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:23,970
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

532
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,090
- I was wrong, ajussi.
- Why did you do it?

533
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,260
Why did you help that person without saying a word to me or to Lee Shin Jeok?

534
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,600
I was wrong.

535
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,470
He only has a temper but he doesn't think before doing something.

536
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,730
For the goal in front of him, he couldn't distinguish between fire and water.

537
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,730
Why did you help him?

538
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,330
Didn't I ask you?

539
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,930
Because we are similar.

540
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,570
The people of my village

541
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,060
only have quick tempers and don't think twice when doing things.

542
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,220
They can't distinguish whether what's in front of them is fire or water.

543
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,200
That's why the people of your village died.

544
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,250
Yes, I know.

545
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,200
But we...

546
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,740
the people...

547
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,010
are like that—because we are suffering in hope.

548
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,960
We gain hope and lose it.

549
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,890
We gain hope again only to lose it. Yet again, we gain hope and lose it.

550
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,190
Because we keep on being like that, we get quick tempers and don't think twice.

551
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,800
We don't even know how to distinguish methods.

552
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,580
That's how we became like that.

553
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,010
I was wrong, Ajussi. I am really sorry, but

554
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,450
just like I went to Ham Joo to find you,

555
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,710
to Bang Won your plan

556
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,710
is probably his only hope for survival.

557
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,470
You and Lee Bang Won are different.

558
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,890
No. We are not different.

559
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,570
I first met Lee Bang Won when I was young and went to Gaegyeong to find my mom.

560
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,300
At that time, to help those of us who were in a difficult situation, that child

561
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,000
was the one who led us.

562
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,690
Also, that Lee Bang Won that I met again after growing up

563
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,300
risked himself in order to help us, like always.

564
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,760
Among the powerful people I have seen,

565
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,270
they were all people who have taken things from us.

566
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,160
But that person

567
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,850
was the first nobleman to help us.

568
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,570
Also, that person, more than anyone else...

569
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,000
No. More than myself.

570
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He wishes for your plan to succeed.

571
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,820
 That's why I, 

572
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,400
 more than anyone else, wish for Teacher Sam Bong's plan to succeed. 

573
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,240
 To defeat the Do Dang officials, turn the tables, and proudly, 

574
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,100
 proudly live with strength in my guts! 

575
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,400
 I wish to live like that. 

576
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,330
That's why

577
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,670
he waited, waited, and waited some more, in that room,

578
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,780
for you to quickly come.

579
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,090
 Ajussi, you have to quickly come back. 

580
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,750
 We will be waiting. 

581
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,340
I know that both Bang Won and I are wrong, Ajussi.

582
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,410
Still, to Bang Won and I,

583
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,130
please give us a chance to make up for our wrongdoings.

584
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,910
Please save Bang Won, Ajussi.

585
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,480
 Ham Joo 

586

 (Lee Ji Ran) 

587
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,910
If we strike these three strongholds, Ho Bal Do's incoming troops
 (Ho Bal Do: Yeojin tribe's Chief) 

588
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,920
will all be defeated by our Ga Byeol Cho.

589
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,390
As I said, they will be in a situation where they cannot move or back out! If we launch a surprise attack at daybreak,

590
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,060
Ho Bal Do's main force cannot organize their battle line

591
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,040
and we can annihilate them.

592
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,480
 Lee Seong Gye 

593
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,050
Between five and seven o'clock in the morning,

594
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,670
we will launch a full-scale attack.

595
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,840
Yes, General!

596
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,830
What happened to Bang Won, and why did you come alone?

597
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,620
Did you send the documents to withdraw the An Byeon Book?

598
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,790
Why are you not saying anything?

599
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,510
I didn't send the documents.

600
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,150
What are you saying right now?

601
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,030
Bang Won was arrested by the investigation office.

602
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,610
For what?

603
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,690
As a condition for approving the An Byeon Book, Hong In Bang and Father

604
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,390
will divide the Northeastern region tax revenue between yourselves. He was charged for illegally negotiating that.

605
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:50,100
Lee In Gyeom has proclaimed war against our family.

606
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,900
So, as the eldest son of the Jeon Joo Lee Family,

607
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,120
I decided in your stead.

608
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:04,160
We have never avoided a fight when our family's name was on the line, Father.

609
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,050
Shouldn't we save Bang Won?

610
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,060
If Bang Won has to die for what he did wrong,

611
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,330
it has to be by our hands,

612
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,540
not Lee In Gyeom's.

613
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,610
In a situation where we have an upcoming huge battle,

614
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,640
I am sorry for saying this.

615
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,380
No.

616
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,440
We have another reason to win.

617
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,670
Let's take Ho Bal Do's head

618
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,150
and discuss the next case.

619
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,540
Daronggarongjoorong... Daronggarongjoorong...

620
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,980
This really doesn't get loose.

621
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,700
That's right!
 (Jukryong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk) 

622
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,530
Who am I? I am Bi Guk Temple's Jukryong!

623
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,680
How could you treat a person like this?

624
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,070
The situation outside has become urgent so we have been busy.

625
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,430
I will explain our stand while we go.

626
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,000
Go?

627
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,290
Where are we going?

628
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,390
You have to go to Gaegyeong with me.

629
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,670
I will relay to Head of Seonggyungwan Hong In Bang the Ga Byeol Cho's stance.

630
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,960
- You're going to release me?
- Yes.

631
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,090
- Right now?
- Yes.

632
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,510
 Damn it. They should've released me earlier. 

633
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,090
If something bad happens to Lee Bang Won,

634
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,490
you said we would gain four things from that.

635
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,080
What's the last one?

636
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,740
I

637
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,030
find your hesitation a pity, Bon Won.

638
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,790
I became like that the more I understood.

639
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,680
"Am I right?"

640
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,600
"Am I also

641
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,240
becoming like other politicians?"

642
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,300
It's because I was scared like that.

643
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,360
By it,

644
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,470
at the moment of the great cause's desperation,

645
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,460
I feared that I am wrong like this.

646
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,070
You are right, Bon Won.

647
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,480
Don't be scared.

648
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,200
Yes,

649
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,080
I am scared.

650
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,710
But I

651
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,130
am me because I am always scared.

652
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,820
So,

653
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,960
I will not use your scheme.

654
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,100
Watch Lee In Gyeom's movements.

655
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,640
What kind of movement are you talking about?

656
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,880
It will be hard to accuse Lee Seong Gye just on a letter and some rumors.

657
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,690
He will fabricate some sort of evidence next.

658
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,920
Watch him while keeping that in mind.

659
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,980
That's right.

660
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,130
This is totally Hong In Bang's handwriting!

661
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,530
Yes.

662
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,900
Since three years ago, I have been training one of my staff to imitate writing.

663
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,730
Great, great.

664
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,540
Now, this...

665
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,450
You can just put it in Lee Bang Won's residence.

666
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,270
Tomorrow, the investigation office

667
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,780
will conduct a search there.

668
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,530
Yes.

669
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:05,480
Since, the secret agreement is written in detail, it will become confirmed evidence.

670
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,670
Now, Lee Seong Gye's moral integrity will collapse.

671
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,210
With that, to prove his innocence,

672
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:19,580
he will have no choice but to withdraw the An Byeon Book.

673
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,200
His alliance with Hong In Bang will also be broken.

674
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,000
I will be going.

675
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,830
I have placed it there according to your orders.

676
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,940
Let's go.

677
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,950
Now, Lee In Gyeom's desire is confirmed.
 (Through An Byeon Book, the tax revenue of Northeastern region to be split between Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi and Lee Seong Gye.) 

678
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,100
After fabricating evidence like this, General Lee Seong Gye's reputation will fall to the ground
 (Through Go Gong Chong Rang Gil Yoo being appointed as Northeastern region tax inspector, Lee Seong Gye and Gil Tae Mi's connection is confirmed.) 

679
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,340
while Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi will be driven into a corner.

680
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,100
Fortunately, I was able to remove it today.

681
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,180
But what are we going to do in the future?

682
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:53,040
Change the letter to this and put it in that place.

683
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,560
I will turn the tables with this.

684
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,270
Everyone scatter and search thoroughly!

685
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,930
Yes!

686
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,650
Search thoroughly!

687
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,670
Yes!

688
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,660
- Search!
- Yes!

689
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,760
Sir, we found something strange.

690
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,860
They say that Lee Seong Gye's residence in Gaegyeong has been searched.

691
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,490
Finally, he's making this issue bigger?

692
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:03,340
They said that the dumb head in charge of the investigation is upright

693
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,910
so we can believe in him.

694
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,940
Using whatever method he can, Hap Ha

695
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,620
will stop the An Byeon Book and break off our alliance.

696
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,220
Whatever comes out of the investigation today is only to push us out.

697
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,390
What can we do now?

698
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,920
There will be something.

699
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,680
Something...

700
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,760
But at this crucial moment, where is Sam Bong?

701
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,640
He said he will be going to Ham Joo...

702
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,400
Today,

703
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,980
regarding the investigation of related materials to the An Byeon Book,

704
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,600
with the many members of the Do Dang,

705
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,890
I want to have a consultation.

706
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,510
Today, at the investigation office,

707
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:11,340
we heard that there was a search conducted at General Lee Seong Gye's residence.

708
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,330
Have you received the report?

709
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,050
No.

710
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,600
He will come to the Do Dang himself and report.

711
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,900
That way, there will be no unnecessary misunderstanding.

712
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,090
Open it!

713
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,470
I am an officer of the investigation office.

714
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:59,650
So that there will be no doubts regarding this investigation,

715
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,180
to personally inform you about it

716
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,020
I came to this place.

717
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,490
Have you found anything worthy of being evidence?

718
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:11,290
Today, from the hours of Jin to Mi, we conducted a search.
 (hours of Jin: 7-9 AM, hours of Mi: 1-3 PM) 

719
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,540
This was found.

720
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:24,160
Then, read the contents of that letter to everyone.

721
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,670
Yes.

722
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:31,760
This was found in Lee Bang Won's room.

723
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,170
No matter how long I wait, you don't appear.

724
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,710
According to your plan,

725
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,590
I killed Baek Yoon first.

726
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,180
Who is the next person?

727
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,810
What?

728
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,860
Weren't you going to save Lee Bang Won?

729
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,510
But mentioning Baek Yoon's murder?

730
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,830
Why did you place the letter the Viper left behind in Lee Bang Won's residence?

731
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,860
Don't you get it?

732
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,120
I don't. This is a different matter than the illegal dealings regarding the An Byeon Book.

733
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,210
Lee Bang Won can die  with just this accusation.

734
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,190
Really? Will he die?

735
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,090
Bon Won!

736
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,670
An intelligent snake will not swallow a boar.

737
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,740
Yes?

738
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,320
If it does, it will break its jaw and its stomach will explode.

739
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,790
Lee In Gyeom is an intelligent and sensible snake.

740
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,750
Also, the current Do Dang can't handle a problem of this level.

741
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,520
What exactly are you talking about?

742
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,630
All of this

743
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,980
is possible because Lee Bang Won is Lee Seong Gye's son.

744
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,960
 The letter got changed. 

745
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,560
 The Elder is crazy. Even if he's just manipulating, how can he put in something that enormous? 

746
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,640
 He's going to corner Lee Seong Gye as Baek Yoon's killer? 

747
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,520
 This was forged. It's impossible. 

748
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,830
 What reason would Lee Seong Gye have to kill Baek Yoon? 

749
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:23,920
 The one who ordered Baek Yoon to be killed was Lee Seong Gye? 

750
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,740
 Is he saying that he will go into war with Lee Seong Gye? 

751
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,240
 There's no way Lee Seong Gye will just sit back while this happens. 

752
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,940
 Whether it is true or not, if he finds out about this, 

753
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,590
 20,000 soldiers of the Ga Byeol Cho will be heading to Gaegyeong. 

754
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,450
 Po Eun, you're thinking of the same thing as me. 

755
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,970
 This is not Lee In Gyeom's work. 

756
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,720
 That's right. This is not Lee In Gyeom's forgery. 

757
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,290
 If Lee In Gyeom corners Lee Seong Gye as Baek Yoon's killer, 

758
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:54,430
 naturally, after calling him into Gaegyeong, he will have a plan. 

759
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,860
 There's no way he'd do it to the commander of 20,000 men now. 

760
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,550
 This is Sam Bong's plan. 

761
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,440
We won!

762
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,590
Great victory! Great victory!

763
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,610
That is such a great victory!

764
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:14,320
 Please, don't say that Lee Seong Gye had a great victory. 

765
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,310
General Lee Seong Gye shot an arrow into Ho Bal Do's horse

766
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,740
and Ho Bal Do fell straight to the ground!

767
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:26,080
From then on the great military force just went  jwang jwang kal pang jil pang
(He is making the sounds of the fighting.) 

768
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:33,420
They lost most of their troops and they just escaped far, far away to the North.

769
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,000
General Lee Seong Gye is truly good at fighting.

770
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,370
But why is the atmosphere like this?

771
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,380
Hyung-nim, let's now go to save Bang Won.

772
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,640
 Who changed the letter? 

773
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,980
 Who would do this? 

774
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,510
 Could it be... the shadow? 

775
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,390
 Was it you, shadow? 

776
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,580
Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom,

777
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,710
will you accept

778
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:04,450
my move this time?

779
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:19,100
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

780
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,490
 Six Flying Dragons 

781
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,400
 He'll try to deny the letter himself. 

782
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,530
 That person keeps on being fishy. 

783
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:32,460
 Is this the end? Can I only last until now? 

784
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,690
 Do you have a plan to save Bang Won? 

785
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,330
 Of course, I do. 

786
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,850
 Before the night is over, Lee Bang Won has to confess. 

787
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,840
 I don't know anything. 

788
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,070
 To save his son, 

789
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,990
 he'll probably come to me to negotiate. 

790
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:50,020
 Lee In Gyeom! You did something you shouldn't have done.
