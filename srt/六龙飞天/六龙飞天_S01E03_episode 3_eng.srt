1
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,900


2
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,930
 We can't idly sit back and trust Lee Seong Gye alone. I shall prevent the war. 

3
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,500
 Just once. Let this one go just once, please. 

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,680
 Why did you not rescue my poor friends, Father? 

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,520
 What is it you're trying to do? 

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,290
 Why, it is to end this rotten nation, Goryeo. 

7
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,820
Don't speak nonsense. You could lose your life.

8
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,310
 If we were to engage Ming in war, we would all be dead anyway. 

9
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,570
 I must go!  Only if I go, can I prevent Lee In Gyeom, who is in cahoots with Yuan... 

10
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,960
 Are you telling the truth?  Can you make me the promise? 

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,180
 I promise you. 

12
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,830
 Today at the Jangpyeong Gate, 

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,430
 we will change history. 

14
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,410
♫  Mu yi yi ya ! Mu yi yi ya !  

15
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,490
 Come quickly. 

16
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,520
 That... That song... 

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,650
♫  Politics that decide life and death 

18
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,580
♫  what difference does it have from the sword? 

19
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,700
 Mother!  That song...! 

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,550
 That man is the Jantgar.
 (Jantgar: the strongest man)  

21
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,730
♫  cannot be found anyway 

22
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,460
You know you wouldn't have done it alone.

23
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,320
A meager thing like you.
 Episode 3 

24
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,820
Who is the real culprit?

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,950
I see.  If you're going to say stuff like, "Every citizen is the true culprit, and the morning will come even if you kill them all,"

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,080
then don't even bother.  Makes me lose my appetite.

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,550
Even so, to just confess straight away is not to be for a scholar either, eh?

28
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,560
I'll provide you the justification.

29
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,140
Oh my god, that's horrid!  It's primitive.  Get rid of it!

30
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,240
Stuff like that is only for the likes of General Choi Young.

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,280
 Gil Tae Mi 

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,630
I like this sort of thing.

33
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,790
You know  domoji , don't you?

34
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,220
 domoji: placing layer upon layer of wet paper on the face until the the mouth and nose are blocked, causing silent asphyxiation. 

35
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,470


36
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,530
How was it?  How was it?  I said how was it?

37
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,260
I was so curious from a long time ago.

38
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,320
How does it feel?

39
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,230
Why won't you tell me?

40
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,010
 Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon 

41
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,930
Hold on to him again.

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,810
You heard, didn't you?  It's definitely that song.
 Ddang Sae, future Lee Bang Ji 

43
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,580
Yep.  It was that song.
 (Boon Yi) 

44
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,200
Since they went in this way, they'll have to come out sometime.

45
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,360
What do you mean that you're not returning to Hamjoo?
 (Lee Seong Gye) 

46
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,370
I am not going to Hamjoo.

47
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,940
Why not?  Would you like to live in Gaegyeong with me?
 (Lee Bang Woo: Lee Seong Gye's eldest) 

48
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,690
 Are you that man's disciple? 

49
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,060
 I would like to become like that man.  What do I have to do? 

50
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,920
Enter Sungkyunkwan.  (Goryeo's highest academic institute where talented students were selected to pursue studies or eventually enter politics.) 

51
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,810
 Lee Bang Won 

52
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,400
I will enter Sungkyunkwan.

53
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,960
Brother Po Eun! Brother Po Eun!

54
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,350
What happened? What about the Yuan envoy?

55
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,910
Eventually, the Yuan envoy in Kanggye, 
 (Han Goo Young, Shinjin scholar) 

56
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,640
went back to Yuan.

57
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,710
In the end, Teacher Sam Bong's words and methods were proven right.

58
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,910
Unfortunately, only Teacher Sam Bong is suffering in the cold prison.

59
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,520
That's right.  It appears that it is your turn to answer him.
 (Hong In Bang) 

60
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,970
That goes without saying!  Even though this deed was accomplished in cooperation with the Sadaebu who follow me,
 (Woo Hak Joo, Shinjin scholar) 

61
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,720
the determination of Sam Bong, who came forth without care to his safety,

62
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,820
was the path of the classic scholar that you all must emulate. Isn't that right?

63
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,960
Yes, Sir.

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,880
That's right.  We must gather our strength.

65
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,000
Find strength!

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,750
Brother! Brother!

67
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,550
What happened?

68
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,750
Please take a look at this.

69
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,670
The diplomatic letter to Yuan that the Prime Minister submitted to His Majesty was fake.

70
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,340
 Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo 

71
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,810
 We must strike down the noble scholars. 

72
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,480
At this time when the Yuan envoy has returned to his country, the noble scholars have taken the original diplomacy letter.

73
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,930
All the contents have been exposed!

74
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,780
Jeong Do Jeon, that bastard—

75
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,080
If this continues, and we were to show any signs of being pushed back,
 (Baek Yoon) 

76
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,330
then the Haedong Gabjok will side with the noble scholars!
 (Haedong Gabjok: 10 noble houses dating back to unified Shila dynasty) 

77
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:11,160
If they believe the noble scholars' prominence has increased, they might aid their power to that of the scholars!

78
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,370
Elder.

79
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,750
What is it?

80
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,070
The noble scholars were trying to submit a letter of appeal to His Majesty without going through Do Dang's inspection, so I snatched it away from them.

81
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,340
What does it say?

82
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,190
The content matters not.  These noble scholars are getting audacious!

83
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,820
They dared to mention Elder Prime Minister's name in that appeal.

84
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,450
 Lee In Gyeom 

85
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,680
They uttered something like he is the very person responsible for all that has gone wrong.

86
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,390
Let's strike!  Let's send this ember of trouble, Jeong Do Jeon, into exile and

87
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,790
strike down the noble scholars!

88
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,910
The problem is

89
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,930
Choi Young...

90
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,690
 Elder Prime Minister!  General Choi Young is here! 

91
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,360
 Choi Young 

92
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,350
Sam Bong.

93
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,650
- Brother!
- The Yuan envoy withdrew,
 (Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo) 

94
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,310
and we the noble scholars submitted an appeal that mentions Lee In Gyeom's name directly to His Majesty.

95
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,690
 Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon 

96
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,870
Everyone may have to face hardship because of me.

97
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,630
If that were to happen, all of us noble scholars may be tested in our resolve and strength.

98
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,600
What was each one's true principle?

99
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,280
What kind of person each one truly was...

100
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,730
Is that what you think?

101
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,730
Truthfully, using this occasion as an excuse,

102
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,120
no one can predict how far they will plot.

103
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,160
Now everything will depend on General Choi Young.

104
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,000
He is the balance of power.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,720
Look at the image of our country!

106
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,240
After King Gong Min was assassinated,
 (Choi Young) 

107
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,580
There was only one reason why I supported you.

108
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,640
The Mongols, Japanase pirates, Ming, and Yuan.

109
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,350
At a time when they're invading us, I only did it so that the country's safety won't fall into chaos and to protect Goryeo.

110
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,270
However, a mere fourth-level academic scholar, alone,

111
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,600
lifted the nation up and down, and you who wanted to catch that lone scholar,

112
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,680
would let in a fake Yuan envoy?  Can you call this a nation?!

113
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,050
I can't express how sorry I am, General.

114
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,340
As such, I was hoping to hear your opinion.

115
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,550
Start with

116
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,310
stabilizing the country. That's your job as Prime Minister!

117
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,990
Then...

118
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,930
I'm telling you to capture all the noble scholars!

119
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,800
I understand.

120
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,230
 Secretly send Jeong Do Jeon into exile without people noticing it. 

121
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,260
 Arrest every scholar who was involved in submitting the petition. 

122
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,950
 Arrest everyone! 

123
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,830
Tie him up!

124
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,920
Wow, Young Master! Because you're wearing clothes like this, now you really look like someone from Gaegyeong!

125
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,730
Is that so? Do I look like I'm from Gaegyeong?

126
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,970
Yes. You look like you're from here. It's awkward but nice.

127
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,410
Then, I'm going in!

128
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,590
Go on in!

129
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,790
What's going on? Who are these soldiers?

130
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,940
 Don't let anyone go out. Arrest everyone! 

131
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,610
Teacher! Teacher!

132
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,860
According to Confucius, what is the "In"?
 In: benevolent, seed, virtuous, etc. Made up of 2 characters: a person and the number 2, behavior toward one another. 

133
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,190
He said that the "In" was the same meaning as the one found in Haeng In, which means the core of the apricot seed.

134
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,220
He said that the "In" was like the one found in San Jo In, which means the core of the jujube seed.

135
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,940
That's right. The "In" Confucius refers to is

136
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,620
a seed! A life!

137
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,380
A seed will sprout.

138
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,290
On the surface it is hard so it appears lifeless, but it will break through the hard part and sprout life.

139
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,480
Therefore, (possessing) the heart of "In"

140
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,700
is to live and commune with all living things.

141
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,860
It is the bubbling fiery vigor!  More they try to confine you,

142
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,160
the more you keep on living and moving! Do you understand?

143
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Yes!

144
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,350
 That's right. I'm in  the right place.
(Lee Bang Won) 

145
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,030
What are you going to do?

146
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,140
Stay still. They're stopping. They're stopping!

147
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,190
Hey! let's take a break.

148
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,970
Go if you need a toilet break.

149
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,800
Ah! It's so hard. Aigoo. My leg.

150
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,490
Ah, my leg.

151
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,550
Sir,

152
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:41,940
that person over there is our father.

153
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,410
He's going far away,

154
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,250
I thought we should pay our respect.

155
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,030
These little brats! You can't! He's a criminal!

156
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,590
Hey you!

157
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,250
They are just children.

158
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,770
They don't know when they will meet again.

159
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,100
Okay, okay. Go ahead and pay your respects.

160
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,880
Thank you so much.

161
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,610
Thank you, thank you.

162
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,160
Ahjusshi, about the song you sang at Jangpyeong Gate. 
What song is it?

163
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,320
That's a song my mother used to sing. We are actually in search of her.

164
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,280
That was a song the late King composed long ago.

165
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,980
That is a song only a few who closely served the late King, and Princess No Gook, know about.

166
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,890
How does your mother know about that song?

167
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,400
Father.

168
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,860
Was your mother in the palace?

169
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,840
I don't know.

170
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,710
My mom's name is Gan Nan from Dongjin Village. Do you know her?

171
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,610
In Goryeo, there would be over a thousand women with the name Gan Nan.

172
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,090
What about Yeon Hyang?

173
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,870
Did you say Yeon Hyang—

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,780
Are you talking about the palace maid who closely served the Princess Yeon Hyang?

175
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,100
Do you know her? Do you know our mother?

176
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,430
I do know.

177
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,710
Where is she? Where is my mother?

178
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,250
She is dead.

179
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,810
She died 18 years ago.

180
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,670
 Yeon Hyang's children? Does that make sense? 

181
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,130
 She died 18 years ago. How can she give birth to a child like that? 

182
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,710
 But that little girl's eyes... 

183
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,770
 Don't they truly resemble each other? 

184
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,990
It seems that the person he knows is not our mother.
 (Boon Yi) 

185
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,150
But that strange man called her Yeon Hyang.

186
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,860
I clearly heard it.

187
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,750
I'm sure you did.  If not,

188
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,090
where would you have pulled out the name Yeon Hyang all of a sudden?

189
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:27,160
If she's Yeon Hyang, she knows that song. Mother definitely knows that song.

190
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,130
Let's go home now.

191
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,590
No. I can't just leave like this.

192
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,390
Then, what are you going to do?

193
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,120
I must know,

194
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,900
who mother is and what kind of situation this is.

195
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,680
Who took her...

196
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,200
I am curious too, but we don't have any method, method.

197
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,730
We did find one person who knows Mom but he said that she's dead.

198
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,580
Still, the person who died 18 years ago

199
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,660
gave birth to us with no problems.

200
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,150
Right, but while we were away from home, Mom may have returned home.

201
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,610
So, let's go home first...

202
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,420
Right, that's possible.

203
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,980
So, let's just go home first.

204
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,730
Right. You go home and wait. I'll look around some more and go back home later.

205
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,170
If you're scared at home by yourself, go to Yeon Hee's house and stay there.

206
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:54,280
You act like you're listening to everything that I say but you didn't hear a thing anyway.

207
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,400
Brother...

208
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,320


209
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,700
Move! Move!

210
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,250
You must really be a Sungkyunkwan scholar now.

211
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,530
That's right. From now, I'll be living in Gaegyeong, so

212
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,980
if anything comes up, come to me. Okay?

213
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,490
Yes.

214
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,780
 Wow, it's delicious! 

215
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,360
By the way, where are those kids I saved?

216
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,220
You know, the little fury...

217
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,290
They left.

218
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,330
What? When?

219
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,880
About two shik gyeong, I'd say.
 (Shik Gyeong: a span of time short enough to drink a tea or consume a meal. A short time.) 

220
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,560
 In Gaegyeong, you are the only one I can trust. 

221
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,210
 I am scared to death that I will lose my brother too, after Mom disappeared. 

222
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,160
 If your father doesn't have power, then what am I supposed to do? 

223
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:40,500
That girl... I was going to tell her that she can believe in me now.

224
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,310
 On that day, I was planning on suggesting 

225
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,350
 that she and I plant a Lee In Gyeom tree, 

226
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:08,630
 and that on the day I become the Jantgar who will defeat Lee In Gyeom, 

227
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,940
 that we should chop down this tree together. 

228
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,670
 Now, I will do it even just by myself. 

229
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,140
Lee In Gyeom.

230
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,090
 I will make sure to break Lee In Gyeom with my own hands. 

231
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,430
 Why does the king discuss benefits alone?
(Yong Bong Sa) 

232
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,910
 Aren't the things that truly matter are possessing "In" and "Ui".
(Ui: to be correct, righteous, and virtuous.) 

233
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,290
The meaning of this statement is as follows:
if the King thinks only to benefit his nation,

234
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:47,050
then the wealthy man thinks only to benefit his household,

235
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,740
and as such, the scholars and the commoners will only think of benefitting themselves,

236
00:20:52,740 --> 00:21:00,360
so the nation will become endangered as the people, of high and low stations alike, will seek to benefit only themselves.

237
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,300
Wow, the truly amazing feat isn't the statement.

238
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,020
You're not using dialect at all.

239
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,590
Aren't you a total Gaegyeong person now?

240
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,920
 Lee Bang Won 

241
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,110
By the way, Brother,

242
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,650
despite how important it is to possess "In" and "Ui", to instruct the king not to care for the nation's benefit,

243
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,310
does that mean that (the king) should neglect the daily living of his people?

244
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,300
He asked that we interpret it in terms of governing philosophy.

245
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:30,770
That is to say that when a nation's governing philosophy is to seek only benefits, the whole nation will devote itself solely to benefits.

246
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:36,470
A politician will step forth to expand his land, and a scholar will step forth to obtain a position.

247
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,240
And when it continues, the people whose situation has become dire will try to survive, even by selling off their own offspring.

248
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,200
What you mean is that if the governing philosophy wins, the whole nation will come to commit deeds like Gil Tae Mi.

249
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,490
As a man whose position is as high as the deputy minister of education,

250
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,910
has sent a person to my house to plead that

251
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,720
he win a claim that will snatch the farmers' lands.

252
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,960
Take it and leave at once!  These lands belong to people who had naught to eat!
 (Heo Jo, chief of legal &amp; legislative institute, Heo Gang's father) 

253
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,770
What will he do with the usurped land?

254
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,660
Elder.

255
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,550
If you bring up this matter and discuss it once more, I'll report you to the constabulary!

256
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,110
 Tell your master as such! 

257
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,200
That obstinate fool!

258
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,380
I can't even kill him.
 (Gil Tae Mi) 

259
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,330
By any chance,

260
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,280
is someone behind me?

261
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,420
Excuse me?

262
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,360
Aigoo, it must be delicious.

263
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,270
Good for you.

264
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,710
I found it out.  Those punks are gathered in Yong Bong Sa.

265
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,700
The likes of Sungkyunkwan scholars would secretly carry out what is prohibited by the federal law,

266
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,160
even resorting to changing the location...

267
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,000
That's what it means, right?

268
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,160
What's the matter?

269
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,930
It is said that Kang Chan Seong has left Sungkyunkwan.

270
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,380
- For what reason?
- It's reported that he isn't saying anything.

271
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,480
In the past month, five scholars from the Mencius textual exposition gathering

272
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,770
have left Sungkyunkwan of their own volition...

273
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,030
This is not a coincidence.

274
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,320
Wouldn't this be Gil Yoo's gang's doing?

275
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,280
In less than a year after our Teachers have been exiled.

276
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,250
Mencius (the philosopher) became the banned book.

277
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,110
The only pretext being that it was prohibited in Ming.

278
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,650
I can only assume they're trying to cut off the pulse of scholars produced by Seonggyungwan.

279
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,490
Anyhow,

280
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,420
until our teachers come back, we must

281
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,590
continue on this Mencius textual exposition gathering. Do you understand?

282
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,770
Yes!

283
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,810
Heo Gang?

284
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,130
You mean the Jeon Beob Sa Chong Nang, Heo Jo's son is?
  (Jeon Beob Sa: government office in charge of law, trial and imprisonment.) 

285
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,480
Yes, Father.

286
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,030
He is the leader of the Mencius textual exposition gathering.

287
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,410
Like father like son...

288
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,980
I'm already upset because that bastard's father doesn't listen.

289
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,350
You must deal with him with care, okay?

290
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,450
As such, I've been making the attendants of that gathering quit of their own volition.

291
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,100
How neatly you tie up the loose ends!

292
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,750
I'm proud of you. So proud.

293
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,590
I will contact you about the next gathering spot and time secretly.

294
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,170
Don't forget that the book must be hidden along the mountain path,

295
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,740
and be reminded that each and every trivial thing

296
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,890
will aid in keeping our intention.

297
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,900
Refreshing, isn't it?

298
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,940
Why are you like this? let go off me, right this instant.

299
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,090
Aigoo, it's so refreshing.

300
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,340
Look at this. Look.

301
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,760
Don't you know the federal law prohibits (reading/studying) Mencius?

302
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,670
Burn it.

303
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,330
What do you mean burn?

304
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,030
Why so surprised at the suggestion to burn a federally prohibited book?

305
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,620
Burn it.

306
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,120
I told you to burn it!

307
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,740
What are you doing not burning it?

308
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,470
I can't.

309
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,310
I am a student of Confucius.

310
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,910
How can I burn Mencius?

311
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,960
Grab him.

312
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,300
What on earth are you trying to do?

313
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,330
You will have a tattoo on your forehead.

314
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,340
A tattoo?
 (Ja Moon: a tatoo) 

315
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,900
You'd dare put a tattoo on the body of a Confucius scholar?

316
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,890
 - Aigoo 
- Why are you like this? don't do it.

317
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,460
You shouldn't move.

318
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,360
Right, you should stop moving.

319
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,490
I will draw it prettily.

320
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,960
Don't do it. I said don't do it!

321
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,790
Don't do it, you bastards!

322
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,350
Stop it, you bastards!

323
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,910
Look here.

324
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,550
Look here.

325
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,190
Look here, Dong Soo. What happened here?

326
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,630
Give it back!

327
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,820
This is an incident which happened within Seonggyungwan.

328
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,790
How dare a mere student try to read ahead?

329
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,580
He is

330
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,430
my closest friend.  Hand it over!

331
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:13,450
Right, that's why the Seonggyungwan counselor must read it first, no?

332
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,500
Look here, Gil Yeon!

333
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,310
Brother.

334
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,350
That.

335
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,250
Under.

336
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,460
 Sa Moon Nan Jeok: a person disturbing the order and  study of Confucius. 

337
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,190
What to do?

338
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,040
Hey!

339
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,440
Hey!

340
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,890
"I am a student who studies Confucius,

341
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,370
have protected the text of Mangja to the end."

342
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,700
 "However, I do not possess the bravery to live forever..." 

343
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,580
 as the scholar who has the tattoo of Sa Moon Nan Jeok. 

344
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,370
I'm sorry.

345
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,850
 Please protect our cause until the end for me. 

346
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,610
One passionate scholar has been born.

347
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,560
But will it be okay?

348
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,850
Our names were included.

349
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,090
All we have to do is write a little dot on a white paper.

350
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,870
Then it would appear as if (he) has thought to write something, but didn't get to, and killed himself.

351
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,950
It's always these obstinate Confucius scholar jerks who cause trouble.

352
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,220
 Brother Chan Seong! 

353
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,760
 Didn't you leave Seonggyungwan? 

354
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,930
Chan Seong.

355
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,450
Brother.

356
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,220
How...

357
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,160
How...
 (Kang Chan Seong) 

358
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,050
How did you come to take your own life Dong Won Soo?

359
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,750
How

360
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,500
did you come to die?

361
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,760
 In the end, 

362
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,790
 I've surrendered. 

363
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,100
 More, more, more!  Hey, quickly! 

364
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,090
 I burned the text of Mencius with my own hands. 

365
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,510
As a noble scholar, I could not allow

366
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,690
a tattoo like that on my forehead.

367
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,990
I should have died

368
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,910
and Dong Soo should have lived.

369
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:15,850
No, Brother.  Both of you have done wrong.

370
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,810
Even if a shameful tattoo was burned onto his forehead, he should have lived out his life.

371
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:25,110
and even if you burned the text of Mencius with your own hands after surrendering to a threat,

372
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,950
you should have remained in Seonggyungwan.

373
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:34,680
When neither brother has done anything wrong, when the wrong doing, an evil deed, was

374
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,130
done by them!

375
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,420
Why would one of you have to take his own life,

376
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,500
and one  leave Seonggyungwan?

377
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,950
They are really bad people. They've done something a hundred times worse

378
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,950
than killing someone with a sword.

379
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:09,010
They incited a person to commit suicide, and caused another to live in shame forever.

380
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:15,240
Or they drew  a tattoo on them so they would  live in shame their whole lives.

381
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,750
For certain, it would have been Gil Yu, that bastard, who incited it.

382
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,430
I can't forgive them.

383
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,370
But Bang Won,

384
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,450
you must not act rashly.  We cannot accomplish anything with our strength alone.

385
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,360
Brother! Brother!

386
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,950
What's the matter?

387
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,550
Teacher Hong In Bang has come back!

388
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,720
Teacher Myeong Jeong has returned from exile!

389
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,970
What? Teacher Hong In Bang?

390
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,790
That's right. He has come back to Seonggyungwan.

391
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,040
Teacher!

392
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,140
Ah, it is you, Gang Yu.
 Hong In Bang 

393
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,390
You have suffered much hardship, Sir.   I am Bang Won.

394
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,370
He came in on the day you got arrested.

395
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:21,280
He is a friend who reiterated the words you spoke at the time of your arrest  every day, as he awaited you more than us.

396
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,620
Did something like that really happen?

397
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,100
One of the students who suffered at their hands will bear witness.

398
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,470
They should definitely be punished.

399
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:36,640
Yes. I couldn't watch them do evil deeds in Seonggyungwan.

400
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,840
That's right. Evil deeds...

401
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,200
Evil deeds, you say.

402
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,990
Tomorrow between 7 and 9 am, we will place this poster that contains all of their evil doings in front of Myeong Yoon Jeon

403
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,870
and start our appeal in earnest.  As such, make sure to contact not only the scholars residing in Seonggyungwan,

404
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:02,210
but the scholars residing outside as well, so that not a single one will be missed at the gathering.

405
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,150
Yes. I will utilize this night to let everyone know.

406
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,820
Don't worry about us either.

407
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,870
Since Teacher has come back, we must use this opportunity to put Seonggyungwan back to rights.

408
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,570
Everyone, please work diligently.

409
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,930
Okay, let's go.

410
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:34,380


411
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,220
 I burned Mencius with my own hands. 

412
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,380
 Scholar Gil Yu and 3 Lee brothers made fellow students burn Mencius text, and were also tattooed and drove those who refused to their death. 

413
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,610
This can't be.

414
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,630
How?

415
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,210
Those bastards who deserve to be stoned to death!

416
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,150
These bastards.

417
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,280
By the way, why am I not seeing Bang Won?

418
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,150
He will come soon.

419
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,800
Young Master, you have to go to Seonggyungwang.

420
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,310
 Do you want to burn Mencius? 

421
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,800
 Wait. 

422
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,290
Young Master!! Something happened last night right?

423
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,890
Yesterday...

424
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:04,550
 Abandon one's integrity on one's own accord, and live forever in shame. 

425
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,300
 If not, they will draw a tattoo on them 

426
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,200
 so they will live in shame their whole lives. 

427
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,480
Young Master, say something. What is the matter?

428
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,600
Young Gyu,

429
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,870
Yes!

430
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,930
A man...

431
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,140
What about a man?

432
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,870
If he lives in shame forever,

433
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,250
how would it feels?

434
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,900
Eh?

435
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,560
 Please let it go this time. 

436
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,860
Young... Young.. Young..

437
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,960
Ah, so frustrating! I'm so frustrated!

438
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,560
Just what would my son find wanting that he would instigate such deeds?

439
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,290
Many students have already read the poster,

440
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:24,650
and the content of it is being spread through the palace. If we do not determine right from wrong,

441
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,900
it will cause trouble for Su Shi Joong as well.
 (Baek Yoon) 

442
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,630
So what?  Are you suggesting we interrogate my son or something?!
 (Gil Tae Mi) 

443
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,160
What? Won't you move it? Do you have a death wish?

444
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,910
Hey, Gil Tae Mi, sit down!

445
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,370
You take this matter over.  If Chief Scholar Hong handles this, even the students won't have any objections.

446
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,180
Wh-What?  Leave this to this guy?  Look here Dae Sa Seong!
 (Dae Sa Seong: highest position in Seonggyungwan, like a dean) 

447
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,820
If he isn't the most impudent...

448
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,470
As he serves Su Shi Joong, he believes himself to be Su Shi Joong, that mad punk.

449
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:24,880
Is that person really the best swordsman? Did he really defeat  Hong Ryoon?

450
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,770
Why? Are you curious? Is it suspicious?

451
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,820
Should I tell you whether I'm the best swordsman or not?

452
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,360
Look, Lee Ma Jo.  I hear you're the best in Seo Book Myeon?
 (Seo Book Myeon: Western parts of Goryeo) 

453
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:54,140
Wow! Look at those eyes.

454
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,730
I can read your thoughts.

455
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,030
"How can someone like you be the first-rate swordsman? I bet it's a false title."

456
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,520
"If I fought him, I would definitely win."

457
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,040
What?  Are you thinking something like that?

458
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,280
How did I know, you say?

459
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,240
There are a lot of people who think of me that way.

460
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,180
If he was the best swordsman,

461
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,730
he'd be prudent, dignified,

462
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,910
and solitary.

463
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,120
Well you'd think he'd be like that, right?

464
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,630
That's why people are suspicious.

465
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,540
But what happened to those people? They're all lying down

466
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,590
under the ground. Be careful.

467
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,350
The long and the short can only be measured through side-by-side comparison! 
(The proof of pudding is in the eating.)

468
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,270
No big surprise here, measured or not.

469
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,270
I placed the poster.

470
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:02,400
I took action as this is without an ounce of deception, and I found no reason to hide.

471
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,280
How could a bastard like you

472
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,550
falsely accuse a fellow student without any evidence?
 (Gil Yu) 

473
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,800
Is there any evidence that they harmed Dong Moon, at Gil Yu's instigation?

474
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,130
Yes, Sir.  We have evidence.
 (Heo Gang) 

475
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,640
Kang Chan Seong, come forward!

476
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,680
Did these people strike you and force you to burn the text of Mencius?

477
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,360
Did these guys threaten to put a tattoo on your forehead?

478
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,180
Say something.

479
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm asking if you've ever seen us outside of here?

480
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,980
Say it comfortably.

481
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,320
Did you burn Mencius with your own hands?

482
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,840
I...

483
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,790
I...

484
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,550
Mencius...

485
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,740
I didn't burn it.

486
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:34,820
The reason I left Seonggyungwan was because I needed to rest from the chronic illness that reared its head again.

487
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:40,280
I don't know why Brother Heo Gang is saying such things.

488
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,500
Are there no lies in your words?

489
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,970
No.

490
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,680
Look here, Scholar Gang!

491
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,050
I order a sentence of ten strikes and disciplinary confinement to Heo Gang, who falsely accused a fellow student

492
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:59,830
and disrupted Seonggyungwan's discipline.

493
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,600
How could Brother Chan Seong do this?

494
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,720
(He) was either placated

495
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,730
or threatened, for certain.

496
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,250
I'm sure he was.

497
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,220
No, it isn't.

498
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,660
In this world, what kind of scholar can say that he burned  Mencius with his own hands in front of everyone?

499
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,770
He's probably regretting telling us about it.

500
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,580
You.

501
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,930
How can you be so sure?

502
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,170
 Lee Bang Won 

503
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,990
 Because I know how that feels. 

504
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,660
Are you declaring war on Baek Yoon, right now?

505
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,940
Then what?  When that wretch Baek Yoon 
was siding with Heo Jo's son,

506
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,550
and saying that he would interrogate my son, did you want me to do nothing?

507
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,270
Elder shouldn't be like this either.

508
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,620
You've no idea how much effort my son put into helping you out, Elder.

509
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,510
I'm letting it slide since it ended well. If it weren't so...

510
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,320
If it wasn't for that, what?

511
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,540
No matter how you feel, do you think you'd have beaten Baek Yoon?

512
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,810
Baek Yoon did no better than to expand his power by taking others' lands!

513
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,010
That's why, Elder.

514
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,870
Do something with Heo Jo, so I can own some land too, M'lord!

515
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,300
This person! Still...

516
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,890
If you ever mess with Baek Yoon again,

517
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,380
I will take care of you with my own hands!

518
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,000
Put me down. Put me down!

519
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,300
Put me down.

520
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,360
Ah, I'm going to go crazy.

521
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,860
What do you want me to do?!!

522
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,690
If I kill everyone, it won't do...

523
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,730
You have a guest.

524
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,980
Young Master.

525
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,110
Young Master!

526
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,750
Young Master!

527
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,800
What are you guys doing?!

528
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,620
Did Gil Tae Mi send you?

529
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,230
If you thought that I'd be broken when he sent soldiers...

530
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,020
My Lord Ho Cheong Nang,

531
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,730
we came to arrest the culprit to a murder that happened last night.

532
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,730
A murder?

533
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,070
Is it correct that the Seonggyungwan student Heo Gang is Jeong Bok Sa Ho Cheong Nang's offspring?

534
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,440
What does that mean? I am Heo Gang.

535
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,120
What are you trying to say?

536
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,320
- How could Heo Gang...
- Last night!

537
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,160
After the physical scrupple in Ho Jo Dong, 3 Lee brothers were murdered

538
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,010
This was found at the scene.

539
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:10,270
What are you doing? Take him.

540
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,300
Yes!

541
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,200
It's not true, Father.

542
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,220
Father.  This isn't right!

543
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,970
Young Master.

544
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,490
Gil Tae Mi.

545
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,290
Does this make sense?

546
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,580
You were drinking with us the whole night.

547
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,780
I will testify to that.

548
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,210
I already did.

549
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,970
Then?

550
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,260
Why won't they release him then?

551
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,280
I suppose they thought it was false

552
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,790
as he is a close friend of mine.

553
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,290
To other people,

554
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,880
the motive is clear.

555
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,280
What happened to that piece of cloth?

556
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,290
Why was it found over there?

557
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,710
There's no way! Does this make sense?

558
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,710
Nonsense!

559
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,610
Saying that Kang has comitted murder?
 (Heo Jo: chief justice) 

560
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,530
What are you planning to do?

561
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,270
That's what I'm saying.

562
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:04,460
Deputy Minister Gil!  Aren't you afraid of heaven?

563
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,990
Then pray to heaven, or something,

564
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,530
to save your son.

565
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,100
If not, then

566
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,960
there are other methods as well.

567
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,250
Do you know what this is?

568
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:48,980
This half the land in Pyeongtaek.

569
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,890
How can the deputy minister of culture be so flippant?

570
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,420
Flippant, fickle, frivolous.  All with "F".

571
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,560
No other letter would suit me better!

572
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,550
Truly mysterious and marvelous, it was.

573
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,060
How did you (come up with) such scheme?

574
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,180
 Teacher, are you here? 

575
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,120
I am student Lee Bang Won.

576
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,110
Is Teacher inside?

577
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:49,780
Elder is at Hwasadan for a bit.

578
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,390
Hwasadan?

579
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,690
Where is that?

580
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,400
It's your first time at Hwasadan, right?

581
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,200
How is it? I was worried that you would hate it.

582
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,670
I have to get used to it.

583
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,370
Yes, yes. You should.

584
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,900
That's how we'll meet each other often.

585
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,610
I have become hugely indebted to you  this time.

586
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:18,520
People like Heo Jo need to have their sons pushed as murderers

587
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,690
for them to stamp something.

588
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,020
I've tried basically everything all that time.

589
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,420
Now it's your turn to keep the promise, Deputy Minister of Culture.

590
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,440
Ah, the marriage.

591
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,150
Of course.

592
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,490
Please let me know once you decide on the date, Chief Scholar Hong.

593
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,300
Ah, no... In-law.

594
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,970
Let's do it that way.

595
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,100
But

596
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:48,340
you didn't kill the Lee brothers yourself, right?

597
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,730
I hired an assassin. You don't have to worry.

598
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:54,010
Aigoo. You did well.

599
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,150
You did really well.

600
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,610
How?

601
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:03,680
I'm slowly starting to like you, In-law.

602
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,830
Is this place Hwasadan?

603
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,380
In-law! In-law!

604
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:38,720
From now, let's meet often.

605
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,850
I am... really lonely.

606
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,750
Let's do it then.

607
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:52,160
Wait. That wretch Baek Yun tries to step all over me constantly.

608
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,530
Elder is also not treating me like before.

609
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:02,520
He wouldn't lift a finger to help me this time either. With whose help  did he become Su Shi Joong?

610
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,760
This time,

611
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,300
it is only thanks to you giving me the strategy, in-law,
that I was able to beat that wretch, Heo Jo,

612
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,540
and been able to take the Pyeong Taek land!

613
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,680
Are you perhaps,

614
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,090
the best swordsman in Goryeo, Gil Tae Mi?

615
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,110
Yes.

616
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,000
I am the best swordsman, Gil Tae Mi.

617
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,170
But why?

618
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,150
By any chance,

619
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,830
Have you seen this person?

620
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:48,010
I don't know. How would I know who he is?

621
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,940
To find a person, I've come a long way from Daeryuk.
 Daeryuk: a large continent, refers to China) (

622
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,660
Please give it a thorough look.

623
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,600
What?

624
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,250
Who are you?

625
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,930
What I've heard is quite true.

626
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:41,040
but it's not you. The sword skills are different.

627
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:48,770
 How can a number one ranking swordsman be so flippant? 

628
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,860
What was that? That old man.

629
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,720
You, what are you doing here at this time?

630
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,680
  Lee Bang Won 

631
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,190
I saw you in front of Hwasadan.

632
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,800
What was that?

633
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,840
What did you see?

634
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,490
I think I might have imagined something.

635
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,700
What you saw was not imagination, but it was reality.

636
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:46,220
How could you do that, Teacher? 
How could you work with such a evil person ?

637
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,970
Evil Person ?

638
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,850
What does evil mean ?

639
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:54,720
Then what does good mean?

640
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,900
The day I entered Seonggyungwan.

641
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,640
You were the one who stood up against them with dignity and left Seonggyungwan.

642
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,500
However, how can you...

643
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,940
With those evil people.

644
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,520
  Teacher! Teacher! 

645
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:27,470
Is there such a thing as an evil person or good person ?

646
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,950
Just by doing evil deeds, does one become evil?

647
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,930
Or does one commit evil deeds, because they are evil ?

648
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,400
  I did wrong. 

649
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,840
  Save me. Please save me. Ahh! 

650
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,320
 I didn't know. It was all ordered by Jeong Mong Joo. 

651
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:57,090
Unless one takes flight, one won't know whether he's a chicken or a bird.

652
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:01,610
I didn't know either, what I was.

653
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:05,490
At that time, what kind of image I had.

654
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,970
Good and evil you say...

655
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,390
What's the use of that?

656
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:14,690
I don't know about good or evil.

657
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,250
But I

658
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:24,050
aspire to be just rather than good.

659
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,990
So you're just playing at words.

660
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,030
What's the difference between good and justice?

661
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,990
Brother!

662
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,810
Are you alright?

663
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,600
I am alright.

664
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,230
We should take care of your health first.

665
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,000
Let's go.

666
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,370
What? What are you talking about?

667
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,320
It's as I just said.

668
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,110
You have to pay the full price.

669
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,870
Even though I wasn't able to accomplish the entire thing, it's nearly as good as being completed.

670
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,500
I put my life on the line and entered that house.

671
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:11,200
Then, are you saying you didn't kill them?

672
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,450
I went there, but everyone was already dead.

673
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:22,780
 So I placed the coat string in his hand, as you instructed. 

674
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,690
What's going on?

675
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,900
 Then who killed those guys... 

676
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,520
 Hong In Bang. 

677
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:41,040
 Hong In Bang. Seonggyungwang Scholar. 

678
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,590
Young Master.

679
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,900
Please tell me.

680
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,410
I'm responsible for your safety.

681
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,390
I will break it someday.

682
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,850
Aigoo, Young Master!
 Jo Young Gyu 

683
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:08,750
Tell me what happened yesterday. Don't talk about other things.

684
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,930
Nothing much.

685
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,150
What do you mean, nothing much, when you're physically faltering!

686
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,510
You returned with your clothes soaked in blood!

687
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,310
Young Gyu.
Yes.

688
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:25,190
Do you know what the difference is between good and justice?

689
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:31,100
 However, I will aspire to be just, 

690
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,010
 rather than good. 

691
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:36,000
 You're playing at words. 

692
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,150
 What's the difference between good and justice? 

693
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:43,190
  Tell me. 

694
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:49,170
 Goodness tolerates and accepts even if it doesn't suit. 

695
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:54,030
 However, justice never tolerates evil! 

696
00:56:54,030 --> 00:57:00,920
 Just is only just, 

697
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,180
 when it prevents evil. 

698
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,990
No way, that kid...

699
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:16,170
What is good? What is evil?

700
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,110
Eh?

701
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:21,750
Aigoo, how would I know that?

702
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,610
Aigoo, aigoo.

703
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,550
Aigoo.

704
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,640
 Mencius 

705
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,140
Are you going to keep talking about other things?

706
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,600
I'm asking about all the blood from yesterday!!

707
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,750
That blood wasn't mine.

708
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,390
Then, whose blood was it?

709
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,470
Aigoo, Young Master!!

710
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,250
Why is it like this?

711
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:46,540
Why this all of a sudden? This is a first time...

712
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,060
The first time.

713
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,700
It's a start from now on.

714
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,100
 The Third Dragon 

715
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,000
 Lee Bang Won
Future King Taejong of Joseon 

716
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:28,440


717
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,030
  Six Flying Dragons 

718
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,840
 Turbulent.  It become more turbulent the longer it we progress. 

719
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,960
 You should have died together.  You should have died,
you idiot! 

720
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,920
 Sam Bong, where are you? Who should be killed now? 

721
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,160
 What exactly did I see? 

722
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,500
 What was it?
