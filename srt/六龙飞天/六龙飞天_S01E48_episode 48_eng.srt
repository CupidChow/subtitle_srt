2
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,320
 Jeong Do Jeon 

3
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,140
 Episode 48 

4
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:08,660


5
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,670
Move, Moo Hyul.

6
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,480
Please.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,170
Go back, Lee Bang Ji.

8
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,430
Prince Jeong An!

9
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,640
Do you know what he did?

10
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,470
I know.

11
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,360
He lured me out and Yeon Hee...

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,060
You...

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,540
Who do you think suggested that we lure you out using Yeon Hee?

14
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,600
It was me.

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,220
I suggested it.

16
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,840
You bastard...

17
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,540
You killed Yeon Hee.

18
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,960
 Lady Yeon Hee died? 

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,860
Moo Hyul!

20
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,810
I won't make excuses.

21
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,080
I don't want to kill you too so please move, Moo Hyul.

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,460
Please go back.

23
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,860
I also don't want to kill you.

24
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,680
If you were me,

25
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,910
could you go back?

26
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,830
If you were me, would you move?

27
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,420
Blockade all routes to Sookjeong Gate!

28
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,840
We must catch Nam Eun.

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Also, Jeong Do Jeon's younger brother, Jeong Do Kwang's people,

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,200
catch and arrest all those who remain!

31
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,780
Yes!

32
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,760
What should we do with Jeong Do Jeon's corpse?

33
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,070
Throw it on the hill.

34
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,440
I am the grandmother of Armory Minister Moo Hyul.

35
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,670
Have you seen Moo Hyul by any chance?

36
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,280
Earlier, he went to the side gate by himself.

37
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,860
Let's go.

38
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,870
No... This guy...

39
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,070
 Side gate? 

40
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,150
No! No, Moo Hyul!

41
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,030
No! Moo Hyul, no!

42
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,380
Aigoo, no! You must not!

43
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,920
Move, Boon Yi. You'll get hurt.

44
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,000
It's all over!

45
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,830
Elder Sam Bong

46
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,590
has passed away.

47
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,620
Prince Jeong An killed Elder Sam Bong.

48
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,570
Elder Sam Bong lost.

49
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,490
There's no turning back now.

50
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,550
So please, even if it's just you, escape. He lost. I'm saying that he lost!

51
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,270
It's not too late.

52
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,310
For the people,

53
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,780
surviving means winning.

54
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,630
So please, let's go, Brother.

55
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,650
Lee Bang Ji!

56
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,280
Aigoo, no. Don't do it.

57
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,520
Are you doing this to see your grandmother die?

58
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,570
If you're going to kill Bang Ji,

59
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,200
kill your grandmother too!

60
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
No, you must not!

61
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,850
Do I have to lose you too?

62
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,520
It's Prince Jeong An! Open the palace gate!

63
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,050
 Bastard. You killed Yeon Hee. 

64
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,580
 How many more do I have to kill? 

65
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,240
 How much more blood do I need to spill 

66
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,930
 for my heart to become strong? 

67
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,440
 Cheok Sa Gwang 

68
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,180
 Lee Seong Gye is really cruel. 

69
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,800
 Isn't the influential person right now Jeong Do Jeon? 

70
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,700
 It was Jeong Do Jeon's doing. 

71
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,320
 Lee Seong Gye. Jeong Do Jeon. 

72
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,220
 You'll probably die within an hour. 

73
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,200
 The beginning of all this, Nameless, 

74
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,560
 the owner of that armory, 

75
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,270
 and... 

76
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,140
Everyone, throw away your swords.

77
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,510
Hey, what happened to Jeong Do Jeon?

78
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,970
He was taken care of.

79
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,930
Right. Good job.

80
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:41,670
Once we cut off Park Wi's head here, everyone surrendered.

81
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,370
What about the crown prince?

82
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,650
He is in Donggoongjeon.

83
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,410
Is Lord Jo Joon still...

84
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,050
No. Not yet.

85
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,860
What?

86
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,770
Sam Bong was plotting to harm the princes.

87
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,010
Plot?

88
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,310
Do you not know or are you pretending that you don't know, Left Minister?

89
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,520
Sam Bong is the person who's pushing this country to war.

90
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,300
And so what do you want me to do?

91
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,620
Cancel the reckless expedition

92
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,540
and receive the royal command from His Highness to punish Sam Bong's crimes.

93
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,720
What about Sam Bong?

94
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,660
If Sam Bong is alive, a civil war will occur.

95
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,340
Sam Bong

96
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,100
died in Seonggyungwan.

97
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,400
Sam Bong has chosen his own path.

98
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,220
So please choose your path as well.

99
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,320
Sam Bong.

100
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,280
What did you say? Lord Sam Bong

101
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,960
is dead? What nonsense is this?

102
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,800
Uncle, calm down.

103
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,780
You bastards.

104
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,320
Are you all out of your minds?

105
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,420
This can't be. Quickly go fetch my pole-arm blade.

106
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,240
Uncle, listen to me first.

107
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,420
How could you do such a thing that not even a beast would do? Without even the His Majesty's command...

108
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,340
What is this...

109
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,320
Give it to me. Give me my armor!

110
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,220
Give it to me this instant!

111
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,220
Your Highness.

112
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,480
Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon

113
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,900
has died.

114
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,000
I won't let these bastards be.

115
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,280
Call Bang Won this instant. Now!

116
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,540
Have you delivered the news about Sam Bong to His Highness?

117
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,100
Yes.

118
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,300
But isn't this person one of Sam Bong's?

119
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,980
That's right. He's Sam Bong's informant!

120
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,020
Look here. Stop.

121
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,500
He's my upperclassman in Seonggyungwan. He's also a colleague from Doomundong.

122
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,100
Right. About Sam Bong's death.

123
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,860
What are Father's orders?

124
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,940
His Highness was greatly angered and asked for his sword.

125
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,100
Also, he asked you to come.

126
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,360
Then, I'll be going.

127
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,740
Your Highness, until Lord Jo Joon

128
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,440
and Lord Lee Ji Ran are persuaded, you must not go.

129
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,880
Yes. I have to do that,

130
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,020
but for Father to give up,

131
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,260
I'd have to help him.

132
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,880
Pardon?

133
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,440
Your Highness.

134
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,320
What happened?

135
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,540
I succeeded in blocking Lee Bang Ji but I lost him. I'm sorry.

136
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,200
I understand. You must be heavily injured so get treated first.

137
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm fine. Where is His Highness. I will guard him.

138
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,460
Hyungnim!

139
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,060
Why are you doing this? Please don't do this.

140
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,980
Hyungnim!

141
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,660
Hyungnim, please save me. Please save me!

142
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,700
If there's anything that I did wrong, please tell me.

143
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,160
I will clear the misunderstanding and—

144
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,060
There's no misunderstanding or sin that needs to be forgiven.

145
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,900
Then, why?

146
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,040
A person who died yesterday

147
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,340
once said something like this.

148
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,080
Sin and death

149
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,140
are not connected.

150
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,040
I have to go see Uncle Ji Ran.

151
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,440
Yes, Your Highness.

152
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,940
Lee Bang Ji has disappeared. Wouldn't it be dangerous?

153
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,440
We have to be prepared. Do it like this.

154
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:17,600


155
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,420
 I'm sorry, Yeon Hee. 

156
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,080
  I couldn't even say what was in my heart. 

157
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,020
 I love you. Let's live together. 

158
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,160
 I need you. 

159
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,340
 I should have said that. 

160
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,560
 Unni, I'm really sorry. 

161
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,480
 Also, thank you. 

162
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,840
 Goodbye, Unni. 

163
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,140
Seeing that you didn't die, it seems that you didn't lose.

164
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,400
I wasn't able to finish the fight because of Lady Boon Yi.

165
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,580
Boon Yi.

166
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,400
Lady Yeon Hee also died.

167
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,560
You have to be careful. Bang Ji won't be in his right mind.

168
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,140
That's right. He's probably not.

169
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,880
What about Elder Sam Bong's corpse?

170
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,100
I heard it's near Doksangam on Gilsan mountain.

171
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,760
Brother, you must not think of other things.

172
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Please.

173
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,820
Boon Yi.

174
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,100
If you feel like having different thoughts, think of me, Brother.

175
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,360
I understand.

176
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,810
Are you really human?

177
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,450
Your Father said that you're smart and that you were studying in Seonggyungwan.

178
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,970
Do you know how much he liked it?

179
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:05,350
When Sam Bong complimented you, your father had the biggest smile.

180
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,910
But you want to be the crown prince?

181
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,790
You killed Sam Bong and your brother.

182
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:23,210
Uncle, you have to persuade Father.

183
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,550
What?

184
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,280
Go out this instant.

185
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,030
If you can't persuade him too...

186
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,680
Shut up and go out!

187
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,580
If Father will not cancel the command for the expedition

188
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,420
and not announce that Jeong Do Jeon is a criminal—

189
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,170
Uncle.

190
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,750
Don't you know what will happen?

191
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:18,760
What? Are going to kill me then too?

192
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,510
No...

193
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,240
At that time,

194
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,520
I will end up...

195
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,680
Father...

196
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,570
Shut your mouth, Bang Won!

197
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,380
If you say one more word,

198
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,040
I will rip your mouth with my hands.

199
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:02,030
So Uncle,

200
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,890
you have to persuade Father.

201
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,550
This is the royal command canceling the expedition

202
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:34,830
This is a royal command permiiting the ex post facto approval of Sam Bong's execution.

203
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,200
I...

204
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
I understand.

205
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,950
His Highness still

206
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,620
doesn't know about the crown prince's death.

207
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,220
The crown prince...

208
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,320
Left Minister, leave this instant!

209
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,910
He's passed away.

210
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,300
Are you saying he was killed?

211
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,730
Your Highness!

212
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,140
Your Highness! Your Highness!

213
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,580
Was it Bang Won? Was it Bang Won who did it?

214
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,220
Get me my sword!

215
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,740
Please take care of your health, Your Majesty!

216
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,060
These bastards!

217
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,460
Your Highness! Please calm down.

218
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,110
Move!

219
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,200
Your Highness!

220
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,190
It seems that Uncle Ji Ran is entering the palace.

221
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,880
Then, does that mean that Prince Jeong An has persuaded General Lee Ji Ran?

222
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,370
Your Highness!

223
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,270
Your Highness.

224
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,340
Your Highness!

225
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,750
You're worse than a dog or a pig.

226
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,700
Even a dog or a pig wouldn't kill their brother and teacher!

227
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,900
In order to take the entire government to himself, Jeong Do Jeon

228
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,350
has made every young prince unfit to be the crown prince.

229
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,250
He planned to get all of us princes killed.

230
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,110
It's the country I established!

231
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,440
How did you become a prince?

232
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,320
How were you able to dream of being a king?

233
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,820
Because for 50 years,

234
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,370
I went about the east, the west, the south and the north to defeat the Japenese pirates.

235
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,470
It's my reputation. My power!

236
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,790
It's the power of the people having faith in me.

237
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,570
Without my sacrifice, without Sam Bong' sacrifice,

238
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,930
do you think you could've ever dreamed of such a thing?

239
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:03,880
So the crown prince who will succeed me,

240
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,360
it's only right that I decide on it.

241
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:17,000
But you stole what belongs to your Father and your brother.

242
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,360
This is treason and revolt!

243
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes. Everything that you said is right.

244
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,450
So the only person who can kill me

245
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,610
is you, Father.

246
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,640
Father.

247
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,030
If you say that you can't forgive me

248
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,030
and that you will kill me,

249
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,730
I can just accept that.

250
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,430
Yes. I

251
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,940
would rather

252
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,980
accept death.

253
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,850
I'd rather have death

254
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,450
for this suffering

255
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,990
to end.

256
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,610
Kill me!

257
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,030
How dare you bluff until the end?

258
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,590
Do you think that I cannot kill you?

259
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,610
Put your swords back!

260
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,540
Put them back!

261
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,240
Please decide now.

262
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,370
My life

263
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,370
is in your hands.

264
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,900
This bastard!

265
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,260
Stop it!

266
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:21,460


267
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,200
Hyungnim,

268
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,500
please stop.

269
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,740
Are you going to kill all your children?

270
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,450
We first had to see Bang Woo off, and now Bang Seok and Bang Beon are dead.

271
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:56,560
Now, Bang Won, Bang Gwa, and Bang Gan, killing all of them.

272
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,830
Hyungnim.

273
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:08,420
Will this end things? Will you be able to live?

274
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,300
Can the people follow a king who killed all of his children?

275
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,790
They're your children, Hyungnim.

276
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,460
Isn't this the country you have established?

277
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,080
It has to end well.

278
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,390
Hyungnim, just this once,

279
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,520
please allow it.

280
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,980
I will go back to Ham Joo.

281
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,940
You have to ascend the throne right away.

282
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,440
Father

283
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,270
will abdicate the throne.

284
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,750
Bang Won, I don't have any sons with my wife.

285
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,050
I don't have other motives.

286
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,180
Do you understand?

287
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,970
Your deep consideration,

288
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,500
I will accept it.

289
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:13,590


290
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,730
 Why did you do something like that yourself? 

291
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,680
 You should've made the other guys do it. 

292
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,260
But you're not there, Hyung.

293
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,750
 I'm sorry that I'm not around. 

294
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:18,180
If I order Moo Hyul to do it, I feel like

295
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,280
he'll also leave me.

296
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,380
 Young Master. 

297
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,770
 Don't look back. You've made it all the way here. 

298
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,760
Right. That's right.

299
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,940
I should do that.

300
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,010
You...

301
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,670
Lord.

302
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,170
- I... Elder Bon Won...
- I heard.

303
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,340
I heard.

304
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:33,020
Don't we need to make a plan for the future somehow?

305
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,430
Of course, we have to rebuild

306
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,920
but not me.

307
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,050
What are you saying? You must not.

308
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,890
As long as we have the Milbon document, we can start over.

309
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:01,250
We still have our Milbon members who signed the oath document.

310
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,820
It's not over yet.

311
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,790
So you should achieve fame and prestige under Prince Jeong An

312
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,550
and look for an opportunity.

313
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,850
What about you?

314
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,470
My last role

315
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,770
is to make you into one of Prince Jeong An's people.

316
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,960
Pardon?

317
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,290
Take my life.

318
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,940
My Lord.

319
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,580
There's no time. Hurry.

320
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,700
 Nam Eun 

321
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,360
Husband, you'll have to go out for a bit.

322
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,980
Brother.

323
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,300
Your Highness.

324
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,840
I heard about Your Highness' rebellion

325
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,150
and I wanted to help but I'm incompetent

326
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,050
so I wasn't able to take part in it.

327
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:14,950
So I killed Nam Eun, a person of Sam Bong's who

328
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,910
planned to harm Your Highness.

329
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,210
Stand up.

330
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,410
From here on, it will be important.

331
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,940
I will believe you.

332
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,480
 Does he know about my identity or not? 

333
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,920
Please reinstate Lee Shin Jeok in a government post.

334
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,910
You were originally in the investigation office, right?

335
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:40,580
Yes, Your Highness. I will pledge my loyalty.

336
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,340
 I have to deliver this message. 

337
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,770
 I have to know where Elder Jeong Do Kwang is for me to deliver this. 

338
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,910
 Ajussi, this is Maeng Soon. 

339
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,750
What is it?

340
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,250
Ajussi, Elder Jeong Do Kwang...

341
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,730
What about Elder Jeong Do Kwang?

342
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:11,000
He said he'll be waiting near Doksangam on Gilsan mountain.

343
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,990
Look here.

344
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,090
Elder.

345
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm sorry.

346
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,130
I couldn't protect him.

347
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:57,490
Don't say such things. If so, I'm also a sinner.

348
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,510
Did you come to collect his remains?

349
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,110
Yes, Elder.

350
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,750
I am grateful for that.

351
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:14,710
But... Did you come here to meet someone?

352
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,130
I did but what's wrong?

353
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,580
Ddang Sae!

354
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,530
Ajussi.

355
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,180
You're here.

356
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,740
Yes, Elder.

357
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,370
Ajussi!

358
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,750
Escape!

359
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,410
Ajussi, get on my back.

360
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,980
Aigoo.

361
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,960
This.

362
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,320
Elder Sam Bong wants this delivered to Elder Jeong Do Kwang.

363
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,880
- I'm leaving this with you. 
- Ahjussi.

364
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,480
Ddang Sae. I was supposed to die in the Western district a long time ago.

365
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,330
I am not scared of this at all. Are you okay?

366
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,670
Take care of our Boon Yi, okay?

367
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,010
Hurry and go.

368
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,970
Get on my back.

369
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,700
Hurry and go!

370
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,410
What are you doing? Search down there.

371
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,250
Yes!

372
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,310
It's the royal command.

373
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,100
What is it?

374
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,820
His Highness has permitted us to search and investigate Banchon.

375
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,350
This is the royal command.

376
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,350
Banchon is related to Jeong Do Jeon's political upheaval in various ways

377
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:26,360
It's the royal command to eradicate all the rebels.

378
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,090
How are we connected to that?

379
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,460
 It seems like the army has entered Seonghyeonbang. 

380
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,900
 That's what Gab Boon said when she came. 

381
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,790
You wench.

382
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,090
Me?

383
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:48,370
Aren't you the one who went to Seonghyeonbang and told Jeong Do Jeon to escape?

384
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,390
Immediately arrest this wench!

385
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,720
No... No. I was just...

386
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,800
Please spare her. Please.

387
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,150
Please spare her.

388
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,780
Stop.

389
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,680
Unni Gab Boon.

390
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,840
An extensive investigation of Banchon will commence now.

391
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,590
Whoever resists will be hurt.

392
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,070
Start searching!

393
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,050
Yes!

394
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,040
 I have to survive no matter what. 

395
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,780
 I have to wait for the next command. 

396
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:05,590


397
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,680
What happened?

398
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,960
You were unconscious for a long time.

399
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,660
Eat some of this. You need to get your energy back.

400
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,110
I didn't know you were alive.

401
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,700
I didn't know.

402
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,640
For ten or so years, I didn't know you were alive.

403
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,700
It doesn't matter now whatever situation you were in.

404
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,120
Elder Sam Bong is dead,

405
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:07,480
so does it seem like Nameless has gotten what it wanted?

406
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,740
I don't know anything about politics, but

407
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,400
from what I've seen all this time, I know two things..

408
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,940
Lee Bang Won and Elder Sam Bong are the same.

409
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,420
The way they think about this world and the country is the same.

410
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,360
Lee Bang Won just wants  to own it.

411
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,010
And the other thing is—

412
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,750
What is it?

413
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,730
What will happen to Nameless now?

414
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,010
Will Lee Bang Won just let Nameless be?

415
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,730
It's the truth.

416
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,890
We were all risking our lives back then.

417
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,910
If your mother knew that you were alive,

418
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,950
she would have run away from the organization again.

419
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,920
There was nothing to do about it.

420
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,550
Yes.

421
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:28,340
♫  Cry, cry, bird.  ♫

422
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:36,470
♫  Sleep, wake up, and cry, bird.  ♫

423
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:46,570
♫  I, who am more sorrowful than you,  ♫

424
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:51,000
 Do Kwang, I think this is it. 

425
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,170
 Don't follow me. 

426
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,470
  It's better for the living person to make a decision himself. 

427
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:03,430
 The age where I don't exist will be different from when I was alive. 

428
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,710
The living person

429
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:11,070
can make a decision himself.

430
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:16,750
  If you see Bang Ji, please tell him that in the end, he fought for me, 

431
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:20,950
 and to not consider his life lightly for me. 

432
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,690
 Elder Bon Won, I'm sorry. 

433
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:30,990
 I couldn't protect you. 

434
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:36,130
 Also...  About this last will,

435
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,300
I will not be able to keep it.

436
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,000
I will do the land survey again.

437
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,250
Land survey?

438
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,710
The land reform is already done.

439
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:02,830
Also, I will break down Buddhism.

440
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:07,120
Your Highness, something that even Sam Bong couldn't accomplish until the end...

441
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,420
Since Sam Bong left without accomplishing all of it,

442
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,440
I have to finish it,

443
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,640
don't you think?

444
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,180
Then, what about the private armies?

445
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,420
The expedition came to be because of Sam Bong wanting to forcibly abolish the private armies.

446
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,660
You have to keep it, right?

447
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:34,870
Look here, Teacher. Am I crazy?

448
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,260
Just leave the private armies be?

449
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:43,310
In the future, private armies must not exist in this country.

450
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,110
Yes, I knew you would do that.

451
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,440
I guess there will be another blood storm.

452
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,980
The first storm

453
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:00,570
won't be that.

454
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,720
If not?

455
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:11,360
It's time to attack the second enemy I talked about.

456
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,890
 I will attack two enemies. 

457
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,140
 Two enemies? 

458
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,820
Nameless.

459
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,100
Do you mean Lee Bang Won?

460
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,640
Lee Bang Won is now the de facto most influential person in this country.

461
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,070
Then, just like when we made a pact with Wang Gun (1st King of Goryeo) 500 years ago,

462
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:36,250
shouldn't we do the same with Lee Bang Won?

463
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,740
I will organize the things to require of him.

464
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:45,290
He's different from Sam Bong, so we'll be able to get through him.

465
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:48,380
He's an ambitious person.

466
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,880
If what I said is true about Lee Bang Won and Sam Bong going with the same policy,

467
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,400
are you going to attack Lee Bang Won?

468
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,950
We don't know what Lee Bang Won will do,

469
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,860
but if he will attack us...

470
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,390
Arrange a place.

471
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,580
What place?

472
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:34,800
A place where I can take Lee Bang Won's life.

473
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:37,680
Nameless?

474
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:44,050
Do you think I would share power with those people?

475
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,650
 Nameless. 

476
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:57,730
 Now I will finally take away that 700 years of life. 

477
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,470
 Lee Bang Won, I'll kill you. 

478
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:15,540


479
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,350
 Six Flying Dragons 

480
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,100
 Prince Jeong An is a sword that's had its use all gone. 

481
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,580
 Please arrange a banquet. 

482
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,670
 For the 1000 years of this country and our pact 

483
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,950
 We'll make it so that Prince Jeong An was killed by Lee Bang Ji. 

484
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,210
 What is it? 

485
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,820
 It's a message for you to spit out the bug. 

486
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:44,140
 Please, Bang Won. You should know by hearing this. Please.
