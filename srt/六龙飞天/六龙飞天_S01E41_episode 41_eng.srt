2
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,510
 Do you think you can take me down with just this? 

3
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,330
 Because I know I can't, I will be even more prepared  from here on. 

4
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,270
 What are you doing? Hurry and arrest him.

 Episode 41 

7
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,430
Hurry and confess. When did you join hands with Nameless?

8
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,100
I don't know anything.

9
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,840
Late last night, you urgently met up with Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won)

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
and that wench, Cho Young.

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,060
Are you saying it's just coincidence?

12
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,190
You're not going to say anything?

13
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,150
What are you doing? Continue.

14
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,870
Yes!

15
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,440
 Father appearing at that time and place... 

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,720
 It means that everything had been planned all along.
There is no actual evidence. 

17
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,190
 But Sam Bong will not let go of this pretext. 

18
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,720
 What are you going to do, Lee Bang Won? 

19
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,520
Then, is Prince Jeong An allied with Nameless?

20
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,970
It is true that he was meeting Cho Young who's been exposed as a Nameless.

21
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:01,520
But how can Prince Jeong An be with those people...

22
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,580
Do you have definite evidence?

23
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,320
Why is there a need for evidence?

24
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,560
The fact that the prince of a country would do something like that is already a big problem.

25
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,880
His Highness is blocking Prince Jeong An's path.

26
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,050
He's trying to put in order everything that may be a threat to the Crown Prince's safety.

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,000
If that's the case, is there really nothing we can do?

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,740
His Highness is also trying to sort out the problem that you are worried about as well.

29
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,460
Don't be too upset.

30
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,380
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,100
It's something related to the Wang family.

32
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,710
Left Minister had a lot of worries from the start.

33
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:56,150
His Highness has put it to the side until now while thinking of the public's opinion.

34
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,130
The whole country is in chaos because of this and that.

35
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,110
All are big problems that can't be just covered up.

36
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,150
So we'll have to settle things as soon as possible.

37
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:12,410
We'd have to start wrapping up things with Prince Jeong An. He's a formidable person.
 (Shim Hyo Saeng: Lee Bang Seok's Father-in-law) 

38
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,330
Lee Shin Jeok also joined them.

39
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,590
Just when did that person follow Prince Jeong An?

40
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,410
Honestly, isn't he disgraceful?

41
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,820
 Dying here is not the problem. 

42
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:35,340
 If Prince Jeong An gets different intentions, Bi Guk Temple will be wiped away. 

43
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,240
 I have to let them know. I have to tell the organization no matter what. 

44
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,060
Yes. I will deliver your words.

45
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,660
You were the head of the investigation office until last night,

46
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,500
but you've become so helpless,

47
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,700
even though you still have subordinates like that following you.

48
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:30,020
Shut up! You ruined everything! What are you planning?

49
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:36,850
Yes. I also got fooled by the child I raised.

50
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,180
That's right.

51
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,340
That wench. That Yeon Hee is the problem.

52
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,410
That wench stuck to Lord Sam Bong and planned this nonsense.

53
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,230
How could I have been pushed aside by such a lowly wench!

54
00:05:52,230 --> 00:06:01,380
Yes. I know full well that you have no connection to Nameless,

55
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,740
but who would believe in my words in this situation?

56
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,350
Since I was caught with Prince Jeong Ahn in the middle of the night, Lord Sam Bong will try to end me here.

57
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
Should I help you?

58
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,520
How can you help me?

59
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,380
It's simple.

60
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,480
You just have to send a short letter outside.

61
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,720
Teacher Ho Jeong!

62
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
I came because I have something to consult with you about concerning Prince Jeong An.

63
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,740
It's happening to Prince Jeong An but it's something that can happen to both of you as well.

64
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,620
What are you talking about?

65
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,980
Right now, Sam Bong is trying to subdue the royal family members who have many soldiers.

66
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,840
Then do you have any good plans?

67
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,780
Immediately meet with General Lee Ji Ran.

68
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:11,240
Together with General Lee Ji Ran, you have to petition to His Highness to deal with Prince Jeong Ahn by public discussion of the Court.

69
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,840
How should I do it?

70
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,320
If Prince Jeong An is conspiring with Nameless, they'd have to do an investigation.

71
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,560
Say that it must be dealt with by investigation and public discussion.

72
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,040
If we do that and find evidence, what do we do?

73
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,120
No. Right now, His Highness

74
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,020
will find it burdensome to make this official and investigate.

75
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,810
- Uncle!
- Aigoo. Get a hold of your temper.

76
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,340
For now, we also don't have evidence that he's not allied to them.

77
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,440
There is no evidence.

78
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,760
If Bang Won is really that suspicious, aren't we supposed to do a cross-examination?

79
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,500
That's right. Just because he's a prince, it's not right to settle it without a fair investigation.

80
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,050
Please interrogate Cho Young.

81
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,560
So you really want to take it to the investigation bureau?

82
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
I have to prove my innocence.

83
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,040
Cho Young received your letter and ran all the way to Gyeongdeok Jeon.

84
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,400
That alone is a problem for a country's prince.

85
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,660
But ignoring your father's face in front of all the ministers,

86
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,760
You want to do an interrogation?

87
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,560
Why? For what?

88
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,340
Lord Sam Bong's and your thoughts,

89
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,580
I just can't act according to them.

90
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,040
Do you want to be the crown prince?

91
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,960
I have already decided on a crown prince.

92
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,500
If you want to be crown prince, you'd have to attack your brother, me, and Sam Bong.

93
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,210
Can you do that?

94
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,360
Father.

95
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,710
How can you...

96
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,470
That is an impossible greed.

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,480
While I still have a little bit of love for you,

98
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,820
stop that greed.

99
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,210
Greed?

100
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,380
Why do you call my dream greed?

101
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,080
Becoming the king wasn't your dream.

102
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,980
Prince Ui An (Lee Bang Seok)

103
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,590
also never dreamed of it but he became the crown prince.

104
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,510
But I've been dreaming of it.

105
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,170
So why is it that only my dream is greed?

106
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,480
I couldn't do anything anymore.

107
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,970
If you still believe that I am a part of Nameless

108
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
you are going to have to prove it.

109
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,080
Is Prince Bang Won really

110
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,520
working with Nameless?

111
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,310
That's not it. This is called a struggle for power.

112
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,590
It's even more brutal than fighting with swords.

113
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,280
Boon Yi's organization has decided to leave.

114
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,570
Was it Banchon?

115
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,090
At any rate, they said that they will be able to at least eat and live without doing this kind of work.

116
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,290
Boon Yi made the right decision about that.

117
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,580
Gab Boon, you should just go with them.

118
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,440
You are kind of part of that group.

119
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,750
Still, would it be alright for me to do that?

120
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,310
I will

121
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,090
try to open a Tavern in Banchon

122
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,170
Let's just try to squeeze our way in.

123
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,780
Let's try to squeeze our way in together.

124
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,180
Whatever happens to Prince Bang Won, it doesn't have anything to do with you anymore.

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,190
How can it have nothing to do with me?

126
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,920
I heard you are leaving for Banchon.

127
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,020
You made the right decision. You're going to do well there.

128
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,780
And the people from your group are going to do well too.

129
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,590
- But Yeon Hee, Prince Bang Won--
 - Although it's unfortunate

130
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,060
his greed brought this upon him.

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,630
Greed?

132
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,040
Why is only Prince Bang Won's greed a bad thing?

133
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,810
When there is just greed, it is not a bad thing.

134
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,320
Even for people who commit theft, greed is just

135
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,410
wanting to be full, wanting good things

136
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,100
That's all. It's something everyone has.

137
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,520
How is this in any way similar?

138
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,300
So, what's going to happen to Prince Bang Won?

139
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes, what's going to happen?

140
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,240
It will probably be difficult for him to return to politics.

141
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,390
Lord Sambong is going to make it that way.

142
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,640
As we said before,

143
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,650
stay away from their issue.

144
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,610
It doesn't seem like this problem will change even if we do something

145
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,050
I don't think this is something that we can help  with.

146
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,920
Probably, right? Obviously.

147
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,440
I heard you made a  tough decision.

148
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,120
Yes, I did. A tough one.

149
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,180
- You're upset, aren't you?
- More than that,

150
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,060
I just don't like it. I hate this situation terribly.

151
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,450
But there's one thing I know. Now

152
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,150
is the time to make a choice.

153
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,490
What will your choice be?

154
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,090
I will go with Prince Jeong An.

155
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,290
Believe in your decision.

156
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,260
I'm not upset at all.

157
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,890
Prince Jeong An will probably be the same.

158
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,410
What do you want me to do?

159
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,910
Ask a favor from that soldier who follows you

160
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,350
and let our organization know about this situation.

161
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,570
Why are you hesitating?

162
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,110
We're just riding the same boat

163
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,460
out of a difficult situation for a short time.

164
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,480
Please have some water.

165
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,250
Can you risk your life for me?

166
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,950
- Of course.
- Thank you.

167
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,240
Deliver a letter.

168
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,760
For now, I'm satisfied with what happened to Prince Jeong An.

169
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,760
Why are you laughing?

170
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,760
Look here, Lord Shim.

171
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes, Lord.

172
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,210
Actually, my plan

173
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,070
hasn't started yet.

174
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,050
No. It has probably started now.

175
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,540
What does that mean?

176
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,320
Bon Won, he's here.

177
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,470
I will never join hands with Nameless.

178
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,250
Yes. Don't worry.

179
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,470
I did as told.

180
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,280
Aren't you from the investigation office?

181
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,400
I think Lee Shin Jeok

182
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,190
has succeeded.

183
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:45,230
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

184
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,540
 This time, 

185
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,560
 your body will eventually get hurt. 

186
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,410
 I am prepared. 

187
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,890
 To eradicate Nameless, 

188
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,980
 I think this is the only way. 

189
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,750
 It's not just Nameless. 

190
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,140
 You have to become Prince Jeong An's person now. 

191
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,950
 -Start.
-That's too much! 

192
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,930
 What's the matter? Calm down. 

193
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,330
 Lord Sam Bong is wrong. 

194
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,870
 Right now, Prince Jeong An 

195
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,160
 is probably really upset because he wasn't selected as a meritorious contributor. 

196
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,850
 Try to approach him. 

197
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,610
 This isn't fair treatment. 

198
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,470
 Do you really think so? 

199
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,440
 Bon Won, this time you must 

200
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,580
 expose Nameless' true identity. 

201
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,840
What? Lee Shin Jeok resorted to desperate measures?

202
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,560
Even if we arrested Nameless,

203
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,950
one problem was that we couldn't get a grasp of their leaders.

204
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,600
The second one is preparation for Prince Jeong An.

205
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,880
Preparation? Prince Jeong An will be chased out soon.

206
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,820
But he's a prince.

207
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,850
He's also an amazing and wise prince at that, so

208
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,980
it's highly possible that he will make a comeback.

209
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,870
Lee Shin Jeok is now under Prince Jeong An because of this.

210
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,810
Anyway, we have to start the next step.

211
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,570
Yeon Hee, organize Hwa Sa Dan's data.

212
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,580
- It's all organized.
- Is that so?

213
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,690
Then we will be able to utilize it soon.

214
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,830
Yes. I will get it ready.

215
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,900
Because of this incident, the Wang family that has a chance to restore Goryeo, the Nameless,

216
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,420
and Prince Jeong An.

217
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,890
We can catch all three of them.

218
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,700
We have to.

219
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,390
Take Bang Ji and start the operation to arrest Nameless.

220
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,160
Yes.

221
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,840
Slowly turn around.

222
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,830
So you're from Hwa Sa Dan.

223
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,880
Why are you following that person?

224
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,680
Why is Hwa Sa Dan...

225
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,830
 White soil mark? 

226
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,110
Is the army following you?

227
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,380
Mugeuk!

228
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,390
I think this place has been exposed.

229
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,330
We have to get out of here.

230
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,270
This is the fourth white soil mark.

231
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,050
Let's go.

232
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,380
Yes!

233
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,030
This place has been exposed?

234
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,970
Just how?

235
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,910
I think the communication line has been broken.

236
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,170
Then...

237
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,070
Cho Young probably got arrested.

238
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,390
If not, she was betrayed or fooled by a plan.

239
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,460
Tell all the members to lie low for three months.

240
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,430
Yes. I will do so.

241
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,560
What about the Ming work that Cho Young was supposed to do?

242
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,210
I will personally do that one.

243
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Teacher Yook San, after three months,

244
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,180
inspect the Hwado Inn in Tamra first and go north.

245
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,040
Yes. I understand.

246
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,330
Let's go.

247
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,900
I think Lee Bang Ji came as well.

248
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,100
The traces were cut.

249
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,500
It's that way.

250
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,840
She was found out.

251
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,270
Divide and spread out.

252
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,460
Arrest those who are suspicious. If they resist, you can kill them.

253
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,110
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

254
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,690
Mother.

255
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,930
That's right.

256
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,150
I was dying to see you.

257
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,800
For a long time, I went around looking for you

258
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,590
but I get to meet you here.

259
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,480
Ddang Sae.

260
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,210
Did you really...

261
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,610
Did you really abandon us?

262
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,810
That's what you told Boon Yi.

263
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,350
You didn't look for us. You didn't even want to look for us.

264
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,240
Our poor Boon Yi

265
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,970
said that you have always been like that.

266
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,010
So she told me to not look for you and just forget.

267
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,760
Without giving her a warm hug,

268
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,710
without even saying sorry,

269
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
that's what you told her.

270
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,630
Please answer.

271
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,290
I told you to answer.

272
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,230
That's what I said.

273
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,010
Everything.

274
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,180
Everything was your fault!

275
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,090
While looking for you, I met Sam Bong.

276
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,840
While looking for you, I learned how to use a sword.

277
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,400
But you never looked for us.

278
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,170
You didn't leave.

279
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,350
You abandoned us.

280
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,290
That's right.

281
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,850
So why did you appear?

282
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,310
If there's something I feel sorry to you about,

283
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,110
I can only do this to make up for it.

284
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,180
Leave Jeong Do Jeon. I came to tell you that.

285
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,020
If you want to keep your life, leave Jeong Do Jeon.

286
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,270
That person has amazing ideals.

287
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,980
And rarely seen in history,

288
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,640
That person, who has amazing ideals, also has great power.

289
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,490
That has never happened before.

290
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,710
But...

291
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,470
A country like that is impossible, Ddang Sae.

292
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,280
It seems that you believe in that country, like Boon Yi—

293
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,540
No.

294
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,560
I'm different from Boon Yi.

295
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,250
I don't believe it and I don't even dream of it.

296
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,910
Boon Yi, whom you've abandoned...

297
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,730
The dream Boon Yi has...

298
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,520
Protecting that is everything to me.

299
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,480
I will protect it no matter what.

300
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,830
So in the end,

301
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,680
you will

302
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,010
be going against me.

303
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,120
That's how it ended up.

304
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,690
Ddang Sae.

305
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,690
The real identity of your mother who lived poor in the Western district for ten years

306
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,630
is Mugeuk,

307
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,940
Nameless' leader.

308
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,990
Boon Yi's dream, the world she believes in.

309
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,310
If you want to protect them,

310
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,370
kill me now.

311
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,030
You can't always protect everything in the world

312
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,950
so you have to choose.

313
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,730
If you can't choose to leave Sam Bong,

314
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,360
you'd have to kill me, Ddang Sae.

315
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,110
I will let you

316
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,420
kill me any time.

317
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,560
If you ever want to kill me

318
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,040
post up a notice any time.

319
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,930
Your once foolish

320
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,330
and innocent

321
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,860
heart. The sin of putting hell in that heart.

322
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,960
That's the only sin I can admit to.

323
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,230
Also, tell Sam Bong

324
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,460
that Nameless will not disappear with just catching everyone.

325
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,600
We

326
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,030
are the people's hearts.

327
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:14,870
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

328
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,260
A few of the lower ranks have killed themselves.

329
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,060
Then the leading figures have escaped again?

330
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,470
I apologize.

331
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,680
But since they lost two of their main bases, their activity will be reduced.

332
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,080
Has Cho Young confessed?

333
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,180
Why would her confession be important?

334
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,770
We have records that can prove her charges.

335
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,870
The assassination attempt of His Highness in 1392.

336
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,490
The materials used for the operation you guys called "Kill the ash tree flower"

337
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,830
were bought by you. This is true, no?

338
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,650
Confirm it.

339
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,380
Yes. That is Cho Young's handwriting.

340
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,790
Is it also true that you made a deal

341
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,090
with the merchant group operated by the dethroned king, Wang Yo?

342
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,510
The entries under Myeongun merchant group are all

343
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,440
transactions with dethroned king, Wang Yo.

344
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,740
What are you going to do?

345
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,410
I am trying to prove that Nameless tried to enthrone Wang Yo.

346
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,740
If you think like that,

347
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,950
then to you it will happen soon.

348
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:47,380
I will talk to her for a moment.

349
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,990
Go ahead.

350
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,280
I have gotten Cho Young's confession.

351
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,830
It is true that Nameless was involved in the plot to assassinate the King.

352
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,110
It is also true that Nameless continuously made deals with the dethroned king, Wang Yo.

353
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,890
Good.

354
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,580
I am going to tell this to His Highness

355
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,070
and get royal permission to execute the dethroned king Wang Yo and the Wang family.

356
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,360
 What are we going to do? 

357
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,610
 By saying that during the process of your enthronement the Nameless was part of it, 

358
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:34,360
 public opinion of the Court is leaning towards executing Your Highness. 

359
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,860
 Your Highness, if you decide to escape, 

360
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,700
 I will help you. 

361
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,000
Your Majesty, what are you thinking about?

362
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,720
You should go inside.

363
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,470
Do you

364
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,480
have something to say to me?

365
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,130
A long time ago

366
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,010
you saved me.

367
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,440
That's right.

368
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,280
Tired from ceaselessly walking,

369
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,940
you were dying from hunger in the streets.

370
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,270
Just skin and bones.

371
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,890
Your legs were so bruised, they were about to explode.

372
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,650
I

373
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,150
washed, clothed,

374
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,970
fed and raised you.

375
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,160
Yes.

376
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,040
You did.

377
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,970
Then how

378
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,600
could you betray me?

379
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,720
I wanted to live.

380
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,590
Selling my smile to countless men,

381
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,970
pretending to give them my heart while obtaining information,

382
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,470
killing.

383
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,840
It was a time when I didn't feel like I was living.

384
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,100
The one who saved me

385
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,710
was Lord Sambong.

386
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,080
Have you not thought about

387
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,810
how you might be being taken advantage of?

388
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,410
Even if I am being taken advantage of,

389
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,800
since this is my dream now,

390
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,360
I do not care.

391
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,600
That dream

392
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,950
will never be fulfilled.

393
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,870
At the end of life is death.

394
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,080
You said this.

395
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,150
Yes.

396
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,900
Even if it is not fulfilled

397
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,440
how great is it that we can dream

398
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,650
while we are alive?

399
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,030
Leave.

400
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,580
Do not ever again

401
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,310
talk to your enemy about such innermost thoughts.

402
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,900
I am sincerely grateful for everything.

403
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,250
Good—

404
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,750
Good-bye.

405
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,400
Take it away!

406
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,510
Until I am allowed to talk with Cho Young

407
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,580
I will not drink a drop of water.

408
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,140
Father, do you not think that Prince Bang Won should cross-examine Cho Young as he wishes

409
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,840
and conduct an exact investigation?

410
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,040
That's right. Father, Bang Won...

411
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,700
I mean, Prince Jeong An. Even if he is kicked out,

412
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,550
shouldn't he leave without being wronged?

413
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,990
I also

414
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,380
think so.

415
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,050
Isn't he this country's prince?

416
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,000
Exile or whatever.

417
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,570
If we just handle it like this...

418
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,690
Fine.

419
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,120
Let him cross-examine her.

420
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,500
But there will be no interrogation.

421
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,560
Just a cross-examination.

422
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,050
It was very touching.

423
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,930
Yeon Hee, that wench.

424
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,160
A traitor.

425
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,480
In this turbulent time,

426
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,910
believing someone is a bigger crime.

427
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,530
How can betrayal be a sin?

428
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,320
Well,

429
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,990
whether it's you or that wench Yeon Hee,

430
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,690
are not even Sadaebu or men so whether you betray or not,

431
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,540
you won't care about hurting your honor.

432
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,850
Though we are not women of a noble family,

433
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,040
we have honor as women

434
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,550
and honor as spies.

435
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,880
It's like that for people like you, so what do you think it will be like for someone like me?

436
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Someone like me... Falsely accused of secretly communicating with Nameless.

437
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,580
I just can't stand that.

438
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,730
I am only joining hands with you for a short time.

439
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,080
Yes. I am aware of that.

440
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,290
There will be communication soon...

441
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,300
What's wrong?

442
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,620
What happened?

443
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,400
Yes. I put it on that place you told me about.

444
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,890
Please untie me for a bit.

445
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,950
Yes.

446
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,690
But Prince Jeong An will be cross-examining that wench.

447
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,160
He's on his way.

448
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,430
Is that so?

449
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,790
When did you deliver it?

450
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,720
I left it there as soon as I left earlier.

451
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,060
I opened it after a while and it wasn't there.

452
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,680
Lee Shin Jeok.

453
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,000
As a person who thinks so preciously of honor

454
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,100
and is terribly scared of being  connected to Nameless,

455
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,490
how can you

456
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,030
escape with me?

457
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,840
If you escape with me, you

458
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,620
will be confirmed as Nameless, so why?

459
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,010
What are you saying?

460
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,600
Furthermore,

461
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,790
if my organization took that letter,

462
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:10,260
to leave a mark, they will open that roof tile and never use that one again.

463
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,760
But...

464
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,520
You

465
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,960
opened that place again?

466
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,980
Lee Shin Jeok, so you're Sam Bong's

467
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,920
desperate measure.

468
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,850
Prince Jeong An will be here soon.

469
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,250
You bastards planned to use me as your spy!

470
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,080
Go out

471
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,720
and buy more time.

472
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,180
Hurry.

473
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,310
Yes!

474
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,270
Wait!

475
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,060
Please wait for a little bit.

476
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,300
What's taking so long?

477
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,250
What happened?

478
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,700
I'm sorry.

479
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,750
Cho Young found out my real intention.

480
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,780
Prince Jeong An is almost here

481
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,470
If this were known, the next plan would be ruined, so

482
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,110
I had no choice.

483
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,700
Damn.

484
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,000
What should we do?

485
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,280
Prince Jeong An is waiting right now.

486
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,720
Move her to a prison.

487
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,730
Pardon?

488
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,030
Cho Young committed suicide in prison. Do you understand?

489
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,020
Cho Young killed herself in the prison.

490
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,820
Do you expect me to believe that?

491
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,070
Do you want to check?

492
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,810
Will you believe it then?

493
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,290
How did you kill Cho Young?

494
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,880
Nothing like that happened.

495
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,050
Are you going to kill me too?

496
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,740
Aren't you already planning that anyway?

497
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,300
Your Highness.

498
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,000
After Po Eun died,

499
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,270
I erased all the hesitation in my heart.

500
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,390
Exercising tolerance,

501
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,930
endurance, patience, and persuasion.

502
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,410
I have realized that things like this will eventually

503
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,970
disturb everyone and bring misfortune.

504
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,000
That's fortunate.

505
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,500
Although you are too late.

506
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,750
Yes.

507
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,170
That's why I am gravely blaming myself,

508
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:55,930
so I hope that I won't make the same mistake with you.

509
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,850
Five years.

510
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,850
Please go to Geoje for just five years.

511
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,070
I was thinking of issuing you a government post in Geoje.

512
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,200
Within five years, I

513
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,720
will make this country stable in many ways and make its foundation strong.

514
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,530
Five years?

515
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,290
It's the time

516
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,720
when Bang Seok becomes an adult.

517
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,010
Yes. Please come back then.

518
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,180
What if I won't go?

519
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,150
You have to go.

520
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,740
If Po Eun had also

521
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,470
done this earlier, he could have been saved.

522
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:54,750
You wouldn't have done such a terrible thing.

523
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:03,030
So I have to save you even if I do it like this.

524
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,480
Yes.

525
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,460
Try it.

526
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,670
Jeong Do Jeon is going in.

527
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,030
Is it true that Cho Young committed suicide?

528
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,390
I apologize, Your Highness.

529
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:41,410
So you weren't able to cross-examine her?

530
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,630
Then, Prince Jeong An won't surrender again.

531
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,120
So instead of an exile,

532
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,300
what about issuing him a government post in a province?

533
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,720
 That's right. Keep him away for just five years. 

534
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,290
 Just five years. 

535
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,400
Your Highness.

536
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,840
I have decided.

537
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,280
Let's send Bang Won

538
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,520
to Geoje.

539
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,050
Your Highness, it's not that.

540
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,700
A message has come from the Mings.

541
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,780
And?

542
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,880
A while ago, they captured Japanese pirates that invaded the frontiers of the Ming's country.

543
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,720
And the pirates confessed that on the orders of the Joseon's Court,

544
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,360
they were spies observing the Mings.

545
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,100
What?

546
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,760
So one of our princes has to go in to Ming.

547
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,440
and give explanations on this matter.

548
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,500
Won't they be hostages anyway?

549
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,530
And what do they mean spies? They are just nitpicking.

550
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,190
And looking at Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's recent actions,

551
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,420
it can't be any more atrocious!

552
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,330
He massacred 20,000 subjects!

553
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,380
It's a place of death.

554
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,710
How can we send our princes to Ming in this hopeless situation?

555
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,810
But if we don't send them,

556
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,340
they'll just make bigger excuses.

557
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,590
 Your Highness, I will be in charge of being the villain. 

558
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,210
 Don't lose strength. 

559
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,940
You are a smart person so you will understand what I'm saying.

560
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,820
Please choose between two options.

561
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,950
There's no other way.

562
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,160
One is

563
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,360
to go to Geoje and stay there for five years

564
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,650
and the other one is...

565
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,410
Perhaps, me?

566
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,340
Yes. That's right.

567
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,190
Go to Ming as an envoy?

568
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,300
That's right.

569
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,290
You might die due to the Ming emperor's anger

570
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,090
or you might go into exile in Ming.

571
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,700
Did Father

572
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,790
really approve this?

573
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,730
Because he knows that the only person

574
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,140
who can go to Ming and persuade the emperor is you.

575
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,360
So he eventually acknowledges me at times like this.

576
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,960
No.

577
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,670
He acknowledges you and he deeply knows that

578
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,080
and you have become dangerous

579
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,040
to His Highness and to the Crown Prince.

580
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,190
Thank you.

581
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,500
I didn't even know that both of you acknowledge me.

582
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,900
I will go.

583
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,200
I can't stay for five years

584
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,350
in a place like Geoje.

585
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,750
I knew it.

586
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,470
I'd rather go to Ming as an envoy.

587
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,080
Whether I die as an envoy while doing work for the country

588
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,510
or

589
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,210
I persuade the emperor of Ming

590
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,730
and return home in glory

591
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,070
within a year.

592
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,610
Father.

593
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,460
Come back

594
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,430
in glory.

595
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,430
Your Highness.

596
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,230
You

597
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,820
make sure to go to Banchon.

598
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,740
Like you said,

599
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,750
whatever happens,

600
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,180
you must not be swept away by Sam Bong or me.

601
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,580
Why, all of a sudden?

602
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,220
You must not be swept away.

603
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,210
What's the matter?

604
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,850
If you don't get swept away,

605
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,390
if you make it so...

606
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,220
You are going to be relieved

607
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,400
and live like a beast?

608
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,380
Comfortably.

609
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,320
Don't say that.

610
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,980
Please don't say that.

611
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,320
If you don't, how can I comfortably leave for Banchon?

612
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,210
Still,

613
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,460
you have to leave.

614
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,640
Whether as a beast or whatever...

615
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,400
Whatever happens to me somewhere,

616
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,040
even if I die,

617
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,080
still...

618
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,180
You'll be somewhere smiling.

619
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,440
Please let me think that way.

620
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,890
During the time when we were friends back then,

621
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,740
the reason why I liked you,

622
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,670
do you remember?

623
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,220
Because I don't look like I will die.

624
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,370
♫  In the middle of this painful world  ♫

625
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:08,400
♫  I breathe and live even though it's difficult  ♫

626
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,370
♫  I try to endure the day  ♫

627
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:18,260
♫  Even if destiny blocks  ♫

628
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,550
♫  and abandon me,  ♫

629
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:27,450
♫  I have to protect  ♫

630
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,880
 Liaodong Fortress 

631
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,340
Why are you here?

632
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,100
We are envoys from Joseon.

633
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,200
We're on our way to accept the emperor's summons.

634
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,440
Arrest these people!

635
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,190
No.

636
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,490
What happened here?

637
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,580
It has started.

638
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,450
What is?

639
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,740
Being an envoy going to the mainland is always like this.

640
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,250
It's not like we came here for something good,

641
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,150
so we won't know what will happen from here.

642
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,180
I've had a bad feeling since we departed.

643
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,500
Ah, my legs are stiff.

644
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,980
You're in trouble now.

645
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,930
What did he say?

646
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,710
He said we're in trouble.

647
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,130
Your country got caught

648
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:19,640
accepting Yeojin (Jurchen) tribes.

649
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,560
He said they know about us accepting Yeojin (Jurchen) tribes.

650
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,110
Well, you are all the same. Uncivilized bastards.

651
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,280
He said we're all the same, uncivilized bastards.

652
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,710
What?

653
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:50,530
Translate what I'm going to say

654
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,320
from here on.

655
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,470
Yes.

656
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,140
Listen well.

657
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,810
Listen well.

658
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,870
You.

659
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,080
Do you want to die?

660
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,470
Translate it.

661
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,350
Do you want to die?

662
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,680
You.

663
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:36,440
Who are you?

664
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,510
He asked for your name.

665
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,880
I am Lee Bang Won.

666
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,980
Who are you?

667
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,010
I am Lee Bang Won.

668
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,690
Who are you?

669
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,410
I

670
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:57,210
I am Ju Che (Zhu Di)!

671
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,980
Ju Che (Zhu Di)...

672
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,240
What did he say his name was?

673
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,180
 (Ju Che (Zhu Di): Later 3rd emperor of the Ming dynasty, Yeong Rak Emperor (Yongle Emperor))

676
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,570
 Go back. I never allowed envoys to pass. 

677
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,960
 The result can be war. 

678
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,270
 Is that what you want? 

679
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,240
 Don't you know that you could die because of what you say? 

680
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,480
 It's tonight. Is everything prepared?  

681
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,140
 Tonight, everyone will be gathered at Jeongyeonam. 

682
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,780
 Is there still no news about Prince Jeong An who went to Ming? 

683
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,670
 Nothing yet. 

684
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,160
 You're probably alive, right, Bang Won? 

685
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,310
 Please let us pass through Yodong (Liaodong). 

686
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,940
 How arrogant and foolish. 

687
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,370
 You bastard will either live or die today. 

688
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,240
 Then please let me die fighting.
