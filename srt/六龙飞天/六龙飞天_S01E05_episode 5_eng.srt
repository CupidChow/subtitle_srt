1
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,730
 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,740


3
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,200
 But why do you want to kill a man called Baek Yoon? 

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,450
 I will put an end to this country, Goryeo. 

5
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,850
 Wait for the right timing and kill Baek Yoon. 

6
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,040
 Baek Yoon needs to die for this rotten Goryeo to end. 

7
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,070
 Sam Bong, who do I need to kill now? 

8
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,620
 New Joseon 

9
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,070
 Just... 

10
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,360
 Who made this? 

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,700
Establish... New country...

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,140
Establish... without war
 (Lee Bang Won) 

13
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,250
without aggression,

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,660
without overthrowing.

15
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,800
Establish new nation.

16
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,040
This is unheard of.

17
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,450
 Episode 5 

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,000
My Lord! My Lord!

19
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,370
What is this chaos so early in the morning?

20
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,690
Lord Baek Yoon... Lord Baek Yoon...

21
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,740
Why are they looking for me?

22
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,500
He was murdered.

23
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,690
His warrior guard was murdered with him.

24
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,880
Was it Gil Tae Mi?

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,800
Either way, he'll be suspected first.

26
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,190
 Wait for the right timing and kill Baek Yoon. 

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,710
Could it be?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,360
 No. It can't be. 

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,950
 The situation now is different from before.
  

30
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,640
 It's something that doesn't concern Sam Bong. 

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
Where were you last night?!

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,320
Why are you asking me that?

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,890
You nitpicked and quarreled with Lord Baek Yoon.

34
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,020
The whole world knows that.

35
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,080
That's right! That's right!

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,800
What? Picking a fight?
 (Gil Tae Mi) 

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,350
Yes! Furthermore, there were times you almost brandished a sword at Lee Man Joo!

38
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,500
How many times were those?

39
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,540
I  almost  did, but I never did it!

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,760
So did you do it this time?

41
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,500
Look here! ChanSungSa! 
(ChanSungSa: name of a political position)

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,340
Who is Lee Man J00?

43
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,920
He's the best warrior in the northwestern side!

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,880
In Goryeo, how many people can actually kill Lee Man Joo by themselves?

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,780
So?

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,200
So are you saying I killed him?

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,560
So where you were between 12 and 2 am last night

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,240
I'm saying that you should reveal that.

49
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,690
Gyung Bok Heung and Lee In Gyeom will suspect each other as the killer of Baek Yoon.

50
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,650
Once suspicion starts it will be unstoppable, and a grand

51
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,200
internal strife will arise.

52
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,660
 Ja Jung Ji Ran: A fight arising inside the same faction 

53
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,040
What should we do?

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
If you grant me the power...

55
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,360
I will try to control internal strife before it spreads.

56
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,400
Now that Baek Yoon's position is empty,
 (Lee In Gyeom) 

57
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,500
it will become a good opportunity.

58
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,390
Was it Gil Tae Mi?

59
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,690
No.

60
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,810
Then, is it Hong In Bang?

61
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,150
It seems like it's not him either.
 (Cho Young-  Hwa Sa Dan's Intelligence) 

62
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,500
Actually, I was not able to discern his intentions.

63
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,410
The Hwa Sa Dan that has a grasp on the most classified information in all of Goryeo,

64
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,190
and you couldn't discover it?

65
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,040
Do you not intend to sell it to me?

66
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,140
Is that even possible?

67
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,660
I am also very flustered.

68
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,990
However, Jukryong of Bi Gook Sa

69
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:57,080
has not been able to find out anything either, so please do not reproach me too much.

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,600
The two biggest information sellers in Songak do not know...

71
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,300
You say that you don't know.

72
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,680
Didn't you always place someone on Baek Yoon?

73
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,800
That's why I

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,060
have been wandering through the incense and easing my mind, because of that incident.

75
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,300
Right now, the most expensive intelligence in Gaegyeong

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,080
has been lost, in front of our eyes.

77
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,140
Da rong ga rong joo rong da rong ga rong...

78
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,900
However, Cho Young of Hwa Sa Dan is also stuck and hasn't been able to find anything,

79
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,860
so don't place too much blame.

80
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,120
Please look into it. I will compensate you.

81
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,260
This incident, however...
 (Juk Ryong - BiGookSa's Chief Monk) 

82
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,260
There's a strange feel to it.

83
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,980
If we keep collecting intelligence and understanding them,

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,130
we'll see a pattern.

85
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,490
There are correct ones and wrong ones,

86
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,170
but we'll see the big picture.

87
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:11,060
However, this incident does not fit into a big picture.

88
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,980
It's just my speculation, but I think this is a plot of someone irrelevant to politics.

89
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,500
Do you know Jeong Do Jeon?

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,910
- Jeong Do Jeon?
- Yes.

91
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,180
I know that he's in exile.

92
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,180
He is forbidden from entering Gaegyeong, but it's been some months since he's returned from exile.

93
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,570
Please look into where he is and what he is doing.

94
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,140
Why are you downhearted and what are you thinking about?

95
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,680
I'm stupid.

96
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,840
Why didn't I think of something like this?

97
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,680
What?

98
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,320
I want to meet with him.

99
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,060
I want to have it and I want to know.

100
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,260
Who is it?

101
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,070
 No matter how long I wait, you don't appear. 

102
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,790
 As you planned, I killed Baek Yoon. 

103
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,110
 Who do I kill next? 

104
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,850
That's right. I at least have to find this person.

105
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,120
I only heard a sound.

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,180
What kind of sound did you hear?

107
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,000
All of a sudden, "Who are you?"

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,540
"Are you Lord Baek Yoon?" I heard something like that.

109
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,120
All of a sudden, chaeng chaeng chaeng.

110
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,250
I heard the sound of swords and a scream.

111
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,440
- How did the swords sound?
- What?

112
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,620
The sound of the swords.

113
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,210
Chaeng chaeng...

114
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,070
Was it  chaeng chaeng  or was it  chaeng chaeng chaeng ? 
Tell me correctly.

115
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,780
It was chaeng... then chaeng chaeng.

116
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,260
Three slashes.

117
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,140
Do you have anybody in mind?

118
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,380
Could it have been Uncle?

119
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,500
What do you mean, uncle? He's an insolent bastard who abandoned his family.

120
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,030
If it's that person, he could have ended it with just two slashes.

121
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,200
No. Ho Dok Soo?

122
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,220
Ah, right. I killed Ho Dok Soo last year.

123
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,000
Lee Bang Woo?

124
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,500
That's right. Lee Seong Gye's first son, Lee Bang Woo, is quite good with the sword.

125
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,220
We need to check on that person.

126
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,250
Could it be the Viper?

127
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,500
The Viper?

128
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,570
Who is that?

129
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,780
Such useless words...

130
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,750
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,910
Who is it?

132
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,270
It's a rumor spread among the people.

133
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,030
Whenever there is a battle against the Japanese pirates, some skilled person appears.

134
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,270
He is an unknown warrior that disappears after slaying dozens of Japanese pirates.

135
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,050
The storytellers in the market are always talking about them,

136
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,370
so I must've overheard it.

137
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,620
It's the Viper! The Viper!

138
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,600
♫  Survive... I will survive   

139
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,510
♫  I will survive in the Green Mountain
  

140
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,290
♫  Eating wild grapes and gooseberries 

141
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,500
♫ I will survive in the green mountain 

142
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,760
Now, then. Shall we talk about King Gong Min who supposedly is alive in a Chinese mountain today?

143
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,310
 That's right. 

144
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,060
No, the Gga-Chi-Dok-Sa! The Viper!
 (Gga-Chi-Dok-Sa: a viper, someone who attacks and disappears fast, like a viper.) 

145
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,650
What are you doing? Hit it!

146
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,420
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay...

147
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,860
General Lee Seong Gye's arrow

148
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,290
was headed towards Ah Ji Bal Do's head...
 (Ah Ji Bal Do: Japanese pirate general) 

149
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,590
while it was flying!

150
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,470
Because the back of Hwang Mountain is so rough in terrain that the Japanese pirates

151
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,660
slink, slink, slink, slink...

152
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,420
They showed their faces.  Those damned bastards.

153
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:33,080
What can you do? Fine. To starve to death or to die while fighting

154
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,840
or to be cut down by Do Hwa Jeon's blade party. "It is mere one life, you bastards," he said.

155
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,590
Pretty.

156
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,700
They were charging forward while shouting!

157
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,330
Move, move, move!

158
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,400
All of a sudden, the burst of screams shot out from the back of the Japanese pirates.

159
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,980
Why?

160
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,150
You're curious, right? About those bastards.

161
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:37,930
That's why, after looking back...

162
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,910
After looking?

163
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,020
After looking,

164
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,960
a warrior dressed in the blackest attire,

165
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,840
with white lapel,

166
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,000
 A warrior... 

167
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,070
charged crazily forward as he killed those Japanese pirates!

168
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,560
His sword moved so fast that neither the blade nor the person's face were seen, but only his black attire and white lapel.

169
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,690
So then, one of the Japanese pirate says, "Is that a magpie or a human?"

170
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,800
Common.

171
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,080
Go on ahead to the inn.  I'll be there after I wash up.

172
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,930
Okay.

173
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,810


174
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,240
Boy, you sure retreat fast enough to avoid paying the street tax.

175
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,100
What did we do?

176
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,600
What are you looking at?!!

177
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,750
Hey, hey, hey... Quickly.

178
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,400
Ah! I understand!

179
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,220
 - Where are you going?
- Just let me get that... 

180
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,400
 Moo Hyul 

181
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,950
Since the teacher said I wasn't to start yet...

182
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,770
Ah, this won't do.

183
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,680
Let's go. Let's go.

184
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,970
Why are you all doing this?

185
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,330
Oh, Warrior-nim! Please save me, Warrior-nim!

186
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,010
- Please!
- What?

187
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,740
If you don't want to leave this world early, don't get involved and just go away.

188
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,770
Okay.

189
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,040
Warrior-nim! Don't go! Please help me!

190
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,030
Please.

191
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,000
Let go of her hand!

192
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,010
What?!!

193
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,780
 What am I saying right now? 

194
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,190
- Come here.
- No, I'm sorry.

195
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,850
Come here!

196
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,950
You totally messed with the wrong person today. Do you see? Do you see the emblem on this person's clothes?

197
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:12,120
This person right here is the Oh Cheol,

198
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,450
a Maehwa Warrior.

199
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,550
 Maehwa Warrior? What is a Maehwa Warrior? 

200
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,520
 What is this? How is that possible? 

201
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,710
 That person won. That person must be really good. 

202
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,140
 So how did he win? 

203
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,180
Aigoo.

204
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,180
 Mae Hwang 

205
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,400
- Master!
- Go, go!

206
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
Master!

207
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,170
If we are to get home within the day, we have to depart early. So why are you so late?

208
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,710
Something happened.

209
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,470
Ah, it's so hot!

210
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,750
Master!

211
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,960
Y-You beat a warrior of Mae Hwa?

212
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Yes, Sir.  I beat the Maehwa Warrior Oh... Cheol?

213
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,530
Squashed that Oh Cheol or something.
 (Instructor Hong - Moo Hyul's teacher) 

214
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,220
 Oh Cheol, no less? 

215
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,110
If one is a Mae Hwa warrior, he is the newest of the newbies.

216
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,950
Will you preen over defeating such meager punk?

217
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,900
Not to mention, I've ordered you not to engage anyone in combat without my permission.

218
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,960
Wait a minute.  Are you perhaps bewitched by wenches, and slurp, slurp, slurp?

219
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,390
It's nothing like that.

220
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,900
You have barely mastered twelve of 24 of my Dong Bang Ssang Yong martial art moves.
 (Dong Bang Ssang Young: Twin dragon of the east.) 

221
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,150
Only if you master the remaining twelve moves, then you will barely be good enough to be admitted into the clan.

222
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,430
If you don't do that, even twelve lives won't be enough.

223
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,510
There is no mercy in the clan.

224
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,530
Before I say that the time has come,

225
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,710
you must not use your strength on anyone. Do you understand?

226
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,980
- Yes.
- Do you understand?

227
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,330
Yes. Yes!

228
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,990
Okay. Let's go.

229
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,770
Aigoo.

230
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,340
Do you know where we might meet with the man called the Viper?

231
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,930
I don't know. It's just something I heard.

232
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,820
What did you hear?

233
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,970
Just that wherever Japanese pirates appear is where he appears.

234
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,700
But for the past few years, there have been Japanese pirates appearing at least once every tendays.
 (Jo Young Gyu) 

235
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,560
Any how, (he) supposedly appears wherever Japanese pirates are.

236
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,370
Okay. I get it.

237
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,290
 Ddang Sae - later Lee Bang Ji 

238
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,860
It's the Viper.  It most definitely is the Viper.

239
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,120
That man was also in black attire with a white lapel.

240
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,430
Find out where the Japanese pirates have appeared now.

241
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,460
Yes, Master.

242
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,650
 Woo Hak Joo's House 

243
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,080
Who do we have here?
 (Woo Hak Joo) 

244
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,240
 Here is the Yi Seo Goon (Western district), here is the Dae Hyun Goon (Northern district), 

245
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,300
 and here is the Han Jin Goon (Northwest district). 

246
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,690
All of this is the late Lord Baek Yoon's land.

247
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,370
That's right.  Won't the people present here

248
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,540
accept the Soo Jo Gwon (taxing rights) over these lands?
 (Soo Jo Gwon: a right to forcibly collect tax from the citizens.) 

249
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,280
The taxing right over these lands should rightly go to Lord Baek Yeon's children...

250
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,130
What curt utterance is this?

251
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,210
I'm not suggesting that you abscond with his children's right to collect tax.

252
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,850
I'm suggesting that we increase the tax rate.

253
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,590
All we have to do is raise the 50% taxable land to 60%, and 60% taxable land to 70%.

254
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,110
I'm telling you to have it.

255
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,820
But you see,

256
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,560
the Yi Seo Goon (Western district) is the land that has reached Su Ryang Ji Jong.
 (Su Ryang Ji Jong: a land that has reached its tax limit.) 

257
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,360
It is a land that already pays 80% tax, so

258
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,880
how could one increase it?

259
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,990
There is a way.

260
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,080
Just raise it is all.

261
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,150
Why do you think the tax limit was 80%?

262
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,170
It is because the people can't live after paying a 90% tax.

263
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,060
I guess you don't believe in the greatness of our people.

264
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,260
Though innumerable kings and nations have flickered away,

265
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,600
but the people have never changed for tens of thousands of years.

266
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,710
Hence, the Yi Seo Goon's people will be able to survive

267
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,310
even after they pay 90% of tax.

268
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,380
Just why... are you doing this?

269
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,960
Because I'm uneasy.

270
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,260
Everyone present here are the next influencers of the Baek Yoon faction Song Hak (Neo-Confucian),

271
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,610
however, having had lost the leader in that manner, you may have become uneasy in many ways.

272
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,110
Hence, it is my request that you soothe your uneasiness with that (increased tax)

273
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,400
and stop the attack on the Su Shi Joong, the Lord Gil Tae Mi.

274
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,220
That's the first reason.

275
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,410
Get you gone!

276
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,790
Is this frivolous scheme something you should say to our faction who has lost the great elder?

277
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,910
You haven't heard the second reason yet.

278
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,100
What is that?

279
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,870
Since King Gong Min's demise, the Lords Gyeong Bok Hoon, Lee In Gyeom, Baek Yoon

280
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,130
and until not so distant past, the Lords Lee In Gyeom, Baek Yoon, Gil Tae Mi.  These three

281
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,720
have held the power, kept the balance, and governed the nation.

282
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,970
However as Lord Baek Yoon has met a violent death, the equilibrium has been broken.

283
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,970
If you lords would aid this humble person with your powers,

284
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,570
this humble man will devote myself to become the chief of Han Mok faction,

285
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,000
and stand on one corner of the balance of power with all of you.

286
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,950
 Hong In Bang 

287
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,060
Help me out.

288
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,760
Send a man to Yi Seo Goon (Western district).

289
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,460
I'm told the Japanese pirates are near Yi Seo Goon.

290
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,740
Good, let's go.

291
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,800
Yes.

292
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,650
I'll definitely catch him.

293
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,790
 Yi Seo Goon Deok Jin Hyeon 

294
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,290
- You weren't caught, were you?
- Of course not.

295
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,790
If we were to have been caught, we would have lost everything to those bastards.

296
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,890
But I don't see our emperor Han Ha Si Joong.

297
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,570
She is coming over there.

298
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,000
You are all here?

299
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,070
Whose command would we dare to disobey, Your Highness?

300
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,620
I already told you not to do such things.
 (Boon Yi) 

301
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,410
Why are you like that?

302
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,560
Yoiur Highness Prime Minister Commander General!

303
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,300
Look at this. Now she's copying you.

304
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,920
To be honest, whenour chief Boon Yi first suggested that we cultivate this wasteland,

305
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,990
we never even dreamt that we would come to harvest!

306
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,810
Right, right.

307
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,710
For exactly three years, while avoiding those bastards' eyes.

308
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,780
Secretly removing stones, digging the soil.

309
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,280
- Oh god.  I'm about to get emotional.
- Stop it already.

310
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,750
If it weren't for Boon Yi, we wouldn't have tried it ourselves.

311
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,890
Thank you.

312
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,280
Why thank me?

313
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,260
With our combined strength, this became our land.

314
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,340
The crops that came out of this land are ours that no one can take away.

315
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,460
Right.

316
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,270
Alright, I'll go stand watch, so get started quickly.

317
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,760
 Don't you recognize me? I'm your father. 

318
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
 What? 

319
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,110
 You forgot that we met before? 

320
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,460
 You called me your father. 

321
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,690
 Could it be... the criminal from that time? 

322
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,490
 Yes. 

323
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,530
 I'm a criminal. 

324
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,090
 So something that terrible happened. 

325
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,590
 My brother left, 

326
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,060
 and there is no news of Yeon Hee Unni. 

327
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,300
 So you don't know anything about your mother?
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon) 

328
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,750
 I don't know anything. 

329
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,940
 I don't want to know either. 

330
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,560
 My mother or my brother. 

331
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,090
 They are people who are already gone. 

332
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,370
 Please have a look at this for me. 

333
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,100
 I learned the letters so I could help the villagers make claims to their land— 

334
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,020
 Do not take legal action. 

335
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,830
 Why? 

336
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,010
 It's no use. 

337
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,290
 Right now, just endure it. 

338
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,220
 This is unbelievable. 

339
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,830
 I never thought you would say something like that. 

340
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,440
 I must have been wrong. 

341
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,960
 You don't have to help then. 

342
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,920
 You will get hurt. 

343
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,490
 Then what should I do? 

344
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,190
 Living means doing something, right? 

345
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,310
 There is nothing I can do. 

346
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,690
 I lost the way. 

347
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,580
 Then should I just die like this? 

348
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,390
 I should do something so I can live. 

349
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,490
 Instead, cultivate this here without anyone knowing. 

350
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,190
 If you don't get caught, 

351
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,740
 this will become wholly your land that won't be taken away by anyone. 

352
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,310
 If it were up to me, I'd put my money on this land instead of taking legal action. 

353
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,460
 If this doesn't work either, then 

354
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,260
 take this and come find me. 

355
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,880
 That's if you lose your way again. 

356
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,890
 We are going to make our first harvest.
(Boon Yi) 

357
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,070
 I found the way, Ajussi. 

358
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,130
I said, did you understand me?

359
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,700
What I'm saying is that from now on, you will have to

360
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,380
pay not 80% but 90% tax, got it?

361
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,320
Because so many Japanese pirates have come this time.

362
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,290
Did you understand it correctly?

363
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,440
If (the harvest) fetches ten seom,
 (Seom: about 180 liters, appx. Today's 50lb bag of rice) 

364
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,570
then you have to pay nine seom, got it?

365
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,540
Yes.

366
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,720
Ninety percent it is.

367
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,560
Why is there no response?

368
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,180
Hey, let's go.

369
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,010
That... That... I should just...

370
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,910
What our chief said was exactly right.

371
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,780
My word. How could there be anyone more like highway robbers than those bastards?

372
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,260
What should we do?

373
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,930
Didn't we prepare ourselves for days like this?

374
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,530
As this is the first harvest year,

375
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,690
This is what heaven wants, right?

376
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,100
Let's strike while

377
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,150
the iron is hot.

378
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:20,390


379
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,910
 Right, this is it. 

380
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,300
It's wholly our land,

381
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,110
and all those are wholly our harvest!

382
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,070
It's a kind of land that we don't have to lose to anyone

383
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,370
and the kind of land where we can reap what we sow.

384
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,340
Right, right.

385
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,550
Hey, hey, hey. Look at these guys.

386
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,090
I was wondering how your reaction was so lukewarm despite the tax rate being increased.

387
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,390
You have hidden away this neat piece of land,

388
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,410
and were going to take in all those crops by yourselves?

389
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,200
All the land in Goryeo is owned by the country!

390
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,410
Ayo, no, no.

391
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,610
The crops will head to the government office,

392
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,130
and I will bring charges against you punks, separately.

393
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,610
Now, put all of it in the cart!

394
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,050
Yes!!

395
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,760
Not those crops.  You can't take those crops.

396
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,920
Kill all that resist!

397
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,690
These were our crops.

398
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,790
If we can't eat them,

399
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,630
I will just burn everything instead!

400
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,150
Father!!

401
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,490
Eon Nyeon, no!

402
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,420
No you can't!  Run!  You have to survive!

403
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,930
We can just do it again. Run!

404
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,540
 - Aigoo, a-aren't they Japanese pirates? 

405
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,660
 Omo, what should we do? 

406
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,280
 The 11th of the 24 moves of Dong Bang Twin Dragon method 

407
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,670
Hoo.  Hiya.

408
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,430
The 12th move of Dong Bang Twin Dragon method!

409
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,160
What is this, seriously?

410
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,720
Nothing works out.

411
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,490
Why the Japanese pirates in the backwoods?

412
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,900
Everything about Young Master is good

413
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,290
except that he's meddlesome.  Right?

414
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,890
Hyung.

415
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,000
What is it?

416
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,810
Our horses are gone.

417
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,300
Those maggots!

418
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,940
What are you doing?!! We should go and capture them!!

419
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,720
We barely found them.

420
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,470
Those maggot, don't even know how precious these horses are.

421
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,720
Luckily, there are only two of them.

422
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,160
Let's take the horses for now.

423
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,050
You bastards, I will--

424
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,460
Aren't those Japanese pirates?

425
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,610
Why are the Japanese pirates here?

426
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,190
Right?

427
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,050
By the way, what are those bastards doing with the Japanese pirates?

428
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,040
But what is that?

429
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,150
What? who?

430
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,010
Are you on their team?

431
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,380
I'm not, Sir.  I just came to pick up wood...
 Moo Hyul 

432
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,450
You came to pick up wood, then what?

433
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:35,610
The thing is that I saw the Japanese pirates moving some sacks to a shed.

434
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,290
Well,

435
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,320
I could hear the shrieks coming from the sacks!

436
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,860
- Shrieks?
- Are you saying that

437
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,890
there are people in the sacks?

438
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,830
Those are the people who were captured and dragged away by the Japanese pirates.

439
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,770
Those gosh-darned bastards!

440
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,360
How many were there in the shed?

441
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,830
There were about eight Japanese pirates...

442
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,940
Outside, there are seven.

443
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,570
Five of the roughnecks are donning the swords, and there are eight inside.

444
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,860
In total there are twenty.

445
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,520
Why are you looking at me?

446
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,080
- It would work, right Hyung?
- What would work?

447
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,130
Ah, why are you like this?

448
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,230
What's with you? Can you do it or not?

449
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:23,220
It's not like we're defending our turf. Invading the enemy territory and taking out 20 is tough.

450
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,780
Five could be possible.

451
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,480
It's too much to do this myself.

452
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,550
You're not alone though.

453
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,330
I'll leave then.

454
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:48,040
Why did you stop collecting wood and follow the Japanese pirates to this place?

455
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,880
I bet it was because you heard the shrieks and were worried about the people.

456
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,540
Then, you should help us.

457
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,320
 You must not measure your strength against anyone. 

458
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,270
What help could I be by being here?

459
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,560
He is right.  Let's alert the government office quickly.

460
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,200
You have a nice build.

461
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,150
Take it off.

462
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:22,460
What?

463
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,210
 Who goes there? 

464
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,970
I heard that there were good dealings happening so I came.

465
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,170
 Ah, I'm ... in Song Hak Trading Company in Gaegyeong. 

466
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,080
Look at this man.  Just what manner is this?

467
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,540
Get out of here when you're warned nicely, for if you try to benefit from other trading company's deals, you'll be severely punished.

468
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,820
How can you treat someone who's also doing business so badly?

469
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,210
Don't you see this deal is something we've already made? So shameless.

470
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,730
There's no need to be so harsh.

471
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,590
You wouldn't buy everything anyway.

472
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,730
You speak Goryeo language very well.

473
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,380
That's because I'm in charge of the intelligence.

474
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,680
But, these two next to you?

475
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,020
This here is my body servant,

476
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,750
and that over there is my bodyguard.

477
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,420
 Warrior. 

478
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,690
Let's cut to the chase.

479
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,280
As I don't know the going rate for this area, I'll offer my rate in Gaegyeong excluding the profit.

480
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,440
How does it sound to you if I were to give 1 seom (1 rice sack) per person?

481
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,820
What?

482
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,020
1 seom (rice sack) per head?

483
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,880
No way, that's nonsense.
 1 seom (10 Mal): 1 sack of rice. 

484
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,680
In here, two mal is the standard!

485
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,470
What? Two--

486
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,320
In Gaegyeong, it's minimum 2 seom per head.
But what, 2 Mal (1/10th)?

487
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,280
We're all traders but you guys are being too much.

488
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,160
No, no, no. It's really not true. This person is lying.

489
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,650
Look here, I've never even heard of a Song Hak Trading Company.

490
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,370
How can you tell a blatant lie--

491
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,260
It's true that (the going rate) is 2 to 3 mal per slave,

492
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,990
however it really isn't 1 seom.  He's lying.

493
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,670
Hurry and get lost.

494
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,260
He said get lost.

495
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,750
 Ah, yes. Hyungnim, let's go. 

496
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,520
He said get lost!! Get lost!!

497
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,340
 First, I'll get rid of those five roughneck traders. 

498
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,320
 Then it'll leave the 15 Japanese pirates. 

499
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,350
 At that time, I will say this, 

500
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,300
 "Do you want to trade?" 

501
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,880
Do you want to continue with the dealing?

502
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,300
Will you really pay 1 seom per slave?

503
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,310
Of course.

504
00:40:53,310 --> 00:41:00,030
I was able to achieve my deputy head's position with loyalty alone, despite this young age.

505
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,560
- How many people can you sell?
- Ten.

506
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,340
Then 10 seom (rice sacs), I shall hand them to you right now.

507
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,760
Wow, it's a nicest thing I've heard today.  I thank you.

508
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,970
I piled some crops down below this mountain.

509
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,320
Do you think about five of your people can go along to fetch them? I will send my body servant along with them.

510
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,170
Well, we can do that. Hey, follow him.

511
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,170
Like this. This way.

512
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,730
 So you're saying I will take five and take care of them, right? 

513
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:42,770
 Then, say that while you were transporting the crops on the cart, one of the wheels came off... 

514
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:47,290
 After that, you take five people with you again. 

515
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,080
 Then, there will be exactly five people left here. 

516
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,770
Isn't it time you'd show me the "items"?

517
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,350
Of course, of course.

518
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,610
What are you doing, not following me?

519
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:20,800
 Listen well. You can just stand by my side and follow me. 

520
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
 Here. 

521
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,940
Come, come, quickly.  This way.

522
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,410
If you see this item, you will think that it's worth it.

523
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,200
Why are you like this?

524
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,140
 Why are you like this? I said let it go. 

525
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:39,530
You wretch!  Are you human?  As the citizen of the same nation, instead of helping, what deed is this?

526
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:50,010
That person is here to save all of you. He was going to get rid of all the Japanese pirates!

527
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,350
 I... what did I just say? 

528
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,830
Slowly get up.

529
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:26,150
You bastards... You were all people of Goryeo.

530
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:32,680
They are fake Japanese pirates who disguised themselves so they can kidnap  people and sell them to China.

531
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,560
I don't know your identity but you know ours so, there is no choice.

532
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,440
Wait!!

533
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,900
What?

534
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,850
I will take the valuables once I've killed you anyway.

535
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:25,590
No.  I will give you thousand times this gold piece.

536
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:31,720
But I will only give it to one person! Everyone, look at the person on your right.

537
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,040
Kill the person on your right.

538
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:47,490
And to the last survivor who cut and cut again the ones to his right, I will grant half of the open field in Pyeong Taek.

539
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,470
Does it sound like a lie?

540
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:55,280
The one who takes me to Do Hwa Jeon after killing everyone here,

541
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,630
is the one who becomes the hero who has saved the eldest grandson of the Lee family of Seong Joo.

542
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,290
No matter how much of a fool the lot of you are,

543
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,400
you must have heard of Do Hwa Jeon, right?
 (Do Hwa Jeon: Goryeo's most powerful man, Lee In Gyeom's, residence.) 

544
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,840
Do Hwa Jeon?

545
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,860
An opportunity of a lifetime doesn't come to you multiple times.

546
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:19,300
Now! To your trivial lives, the first opportunity has arrived.

547
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,660
Hurry!

548
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,240
To make a living, didn't you kidnap fellow Goryeo citizens?

549
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,530
Didn't you give up being human?  Why do you hesitate?

550
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:46,470
If you're not going to be human, just live as beasts instead.

551
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,320
We are not beasts!

552
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,420
Then what are you exactly?

553
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,190
The beings who couldn't be humans,

554
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,110
can't even be beasts,

555
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:20,650
There is no choice then.

556
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,340
I'll have to kill you all off.

557
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:31,390
I'm the eldest son of the Great Goryeo's Minister of Culture, Lee In Gyeom, and that person standing there is

558
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,640
 Me? 

559
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,130
He is the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms, Gil Tae Mi!

560
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,290
 I am? 

561
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:50,350
He has merely stood by and watched, as he felt pity for your trivial lives.

562
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,420
Warrior-nim.

563
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,520
I don't think this will do.  Please do kill them all.

564
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:15,820
 Please, please, take the sword out. That's all you have to do. 

565
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:20,890
  Why is he like this to me? I can't do it. 

566
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,670
Those bastards are fake. Don't be scared.

567
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:31,250
Gil Tae Mi is the one who killed Hong Ryoon. 
There's no way Gil Tae Mi is that young.

568
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,730
Warrior-nim, hurry and draw your sword!

569
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,240
This wench, I will really...

570
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:52,450
Warrior Moo Hyul!

571
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:24,740
Hey.

572
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,250
Mae Hwa Warrior?

573
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:41,950
Mae Hwa Warrior?

574
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:48,390
Jo Doo's highest level of warriors.  Though the clan has dispersed, the infamy of the Mae Hwa warrior is...

575
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:56,060
Tell it to me straight.  What is this about Mae Hwa warrior?

576
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:02,180
Doesn't Hong Yoon Do Go Deok Soo also spring from Mae Hwa warrior?

577
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,440
 Please spare me this time. 

578
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,990
 Mae Hwa warrior is the highest level of warrior? 

579
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,730
 To speak of Mae Hwa warrior, they're the newest of the newbies who can't even hold a sword correctly! 

580
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:13,290
 I was tricked. 

581
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,490
 Un Yeon!! 

582
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:29,600
Ah, so tough.  Aigoo, I don't know if I can do this three times.

583
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:35,960
Ah, so hard. Ah.

584
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,630
Aigoo.  Aigoo Master, a wheel of the cart came off so...

585
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,050
What happened here?

586
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,560
Endure for a little longer, Un Yeon.

587
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,500
Let's go home. Home.

588
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,250
Unni...

589
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,490
Yeah?

590
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,370
Help me, Great General Highness.

591
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,850
It hurts...

592
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,140
 Un Yeon. 

593
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,420
Un Yeon, Un Yeon.

594
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,200
Un Yeon!!

595
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,340
Oh my, what should we do?

596
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,650
Aigoo, Un Yeon.

597
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,180
Un Yeon... What do we do...

598
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,190
Aigoo...

599
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,410
Where are you going?

600
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:43,390
Thank you for saving me.

601
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,740
I asked where are you going?

602
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,050
I'm going to the government office.

603
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,190
Why are you going to the government office?

604
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,270
You heard our situation.

605
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:59,130
We cultivated the barren soil, but had all of our crops were taken

606
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,290
and people were injured and died.

607
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,310
We can't just sit around like this.

608
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:06,890
I've told you that this is Hong In Bang's government workers' doings.

609
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:11,230
Hong In Bang is the one that put the current local official into office.

610
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:16,260
But you are going to report it to the government office? Do you want to accompany those that passed away?

611
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,150
I have to go.

612
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,710
Even if the local official treats this problem fairly,

613
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,170
this was against the national law.

614
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:34,210
By the looks of it, you guys created this whole mess by secretly cultivating a land without telling the government office.

615
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,790
So it's true that you guys broke the law.

616
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,970
What do you nobles know about anything?

617
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,050
You nobles?

618
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,950
Originally, we used to harvest 400 sacks of crops  from our lands each year.

619
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,920
National law?

620
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,830
According to the national law, we give 40 to the national government, and 40 to the local government.

621
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,830
But I've never seen that actually happen since the day I was born.

622
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:07,910
The year I was born, I heard we gave 240 sacks.

623
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:11,470
The year I turned six, we gave 320 sacks.

624
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,230
And not long ago,

625
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:20,850
to these eight nobles claiming to be the owners,

626
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,230
we had to give 360 sacks!

627
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:30,350
There are about 200 people that have to live off of the 40 remaining sacks for a whole year.

628
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,410
You have no idea what that number means, do you?

629
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:36,230
That means you have to live every day with only two spoonfuls of rice to eat!

630
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,980
Regardless, we still had to live.

631
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:48,000
So that's why we kept digging and digging this barren soil.

632
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,970
And this year's harvest was our first yield.

633
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,640
But then...

634
00:54:54,900 --> 00:55:00,750
they killed people and stole all of our crops.

635
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:07,540
That's why, for the sake of Un Yeon who's left this world after three years of cultivation and not a single grain to eat,

636
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:13,720
I'm going to do something.

637
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:19,990
Because as long as I'm alive, I have to do something.

638
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,280
- I think I need to go after her.
- Why?

639
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,930
I heard a sound from her heart.

640
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,970
Please stop making jokes like that.

641
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:56,010
I know you are saying that to keep my mouth shut. I'm not going to fall for it anymore.

642
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,260
Even though I got tricked once or twice, but...

643
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,700
- Hiyah!
- Sigh

644
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,650
Jeez... Studious people are always slow to act because they think too much,

645
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:09,870
but I guess he's not studying anymore. Nope, he didn't study.

646
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,150
Let's go!

647
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,900
I-I-I think that's in the direction of the provincial office of Lee SeoGoon.

648
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,710
That's the crop storage! The crop storage!

649
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,540
No way!

650
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,020
What is that? You did that?

651
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,280
It was ours.

652
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,720
When you said you've to do something for Un Yeon...

653
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,450
I had gone to hold a funeral.

654
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:26,890
Un Yeon was always hungry.

655
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,420
She should at least be fed well as she's leaving this world.

656
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,390
That woman is really crazy.

657
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,210
Still, how could she burn down the crop storage of the provincial office?

658
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,590
You know, she is...

659
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:01,270
Yes, Master. She's really crazy.

660
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,220
She is...

661
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,550
so romantic.

662
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,150
Eh?

663
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,940
 If that doesn't do it, 

664
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,020
 take this and come find me, 

665
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,480
 if you get lost again. 

666
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,490
 I'm lost again. 

667
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:55,710
 Yes, I'll go to you, right now. 

668
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,860
 Fifth dragon 

669
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,970
 Boon Yi: later Lee Bang Won's Lover 

670
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:13,150


671
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,260
 Six Flying Dragons 

672
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,720
 I am deeply sorry, Young Lord. 

673
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,110
 Hey, Hey!! 

674
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,530
 There's someone that I really have to meet. 
There might be a way we can all survive. 

675
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,070
 I've grasped hold of a clue. 

676
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,590
 Do you know of Lee Eun Chung? 

677
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,900
 He used to be a student of Sam Bong. 

678
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,730
 I don't know what's going on, but how could you do such a thing to a person? 

679
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,090
Are you Teacher Lee Eun Chang?  

680
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,640
 The thing that you desire... 

681
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,910
 This. 

682
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,790
 I'm warrior Moo Hyul. 

683
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,880
 It's dangerous. 

684
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,000
 Why did you steal and run away? Why? Why do you ignore my kindness?
