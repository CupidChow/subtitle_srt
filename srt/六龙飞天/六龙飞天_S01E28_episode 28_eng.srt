 Episode 28 

3
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,740
 Yeon Hyang! 

4
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,750
 Mother

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

6
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,240
Right? It was her, right?

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,100
My mother is...

8
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,290
My mother is here.

9
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,710
I was right that that was Yeon Hyang!

10
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,590
Gil Seon Mi is also gone.

11
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,160
This temple contains the memorandum of King Taejo.

12
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,030
It's a place where those with severe illness or retired soldiers stay.

13
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,910
How can you dare to bring military troops to this place?

14
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,760
It's an important matter connected to the death of the country's government officials.
 (Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon) 

15
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,400
Then, please proceed as quietly as you can.

16
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,390
Without missing anything, search thoroughly.
 (Nam Eun) 

17
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,050
Yes!

18
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,980
Search everywhere!

19
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,710
This way!

20
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,980
There was nothing.

21
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,560
There's nothing here.

22
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,660
- Nothing here.
- There's nothing here.

23
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,730
There was nothing strange.

24
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,000
I couldn't have seen it wrong.

25
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,510
There's no way that both of us saw it wrong.

26
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,200
It was definitely Yeon Hyang.

27
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,890
But how

28
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,250
can she disappear in a blink of an eye?

29
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,810
I've been looking for her for ten years.

30
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,660
How can she disappear in front of me?

31
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,960
We managed to catch one of Gil Seon Mi's men alive. He's probably being interrogated now.

32
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,270
Let's try to put our hopes on that man.

33
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,980
If you are thinking of confessing, nod your head.

34
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,830
I will torture you to make you nod your head.

35
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,680
Look at all these reports!

36
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,760
These are all reports regarding the land reformation survey that we have to review.

37
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,060
Yanggwang-do, Jeolla-do, Jeongsang-do. There's no place that didn't send one.

38
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,840
That's why His Highness ordered us to discuss this over again.
 (Lee Saek) 

39
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,830
We must not stop the land survey.

40
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,270
Three officials already died!

41
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,630
The investigation regarding that case is underway,

42
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,550
but if we stop the land survey here, we'll be moving exactly the way those people wanted us to.

43
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,370
A country's politics must not be moved that way.

44
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:52,070
Yes. The land survey has already received royal assent to proceed,

45
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,270
so we cannot stop it even if we want to and it must not stop.

46
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,010
Yes. I completely agree with that.
 (Min Je: Haedong Gapjok's Head, nicknamed Po Eun) 

47
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,630
Isn't it something that has already started and must be pushed through?

48
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,730
Still, only after the people who killed the officials are exposed

49
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,500
can the land survey proceed. That's the right order.

50
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
That's right!

51
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,220
How can you not say a word?

52
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,070
Can the reformation really be stuck like this?

53
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,480
At the end of that reform!

54
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,090
I know what lies at the end of that reform
 (Po EUn: Jeong Mong Joo) 

55
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,810
How can I support you like a shield?

56
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,210
I'm not doing the reform to achieve that.

57
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,820
It's just that after doing the reform, it naturally goes that way.

58
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,710
Colleague... If we lose this chance, there will be even bigger resistance.

59
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,870
I'm also trying. I'm trying.

60
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,520
Do you know who sent you the letter that led you to my cave?

61
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,900
Those people are the ones who killed the land survey officials.

62
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,780
Does that mean that you know who those people are?

63
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,580
Who are they?

64
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,820
It's Nameless.

65
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,460
Nameless.

66
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:36,440
Nameless. Are you talking about those who King Gong Min thoughtlessly talked about before?

67
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,960
It's not a rumor. They actually exist.

68
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,020
It can't be.

69
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,000
Ho Jeong said that Lee In Gyeom was also chasing after this organization.

70
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,110
Whether it is Nameless or not,

71
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,280
we are getting played with by this powerful group that is trying to stop the land reform!

72
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,450
 Bad things always come at the same time. 

73
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,530
 Three problems have occurred all at once. 

74
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,170
 The difficulty of the investigation was the first problem. 

75
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,510
 The land reform being delayed is the second. 

76
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,790
 Of all times, Po Eun learns about our work now. That's the third. 

77
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,380
 No. Actually, there's only one problem. 

78
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,580
 Nameless. It's Nameless. 

79
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,070
Did you find anything at that Buddhist temple?

80
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,490
There were no court people from King Gong Min's reign.

81
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,510
There is also no one who knows Yeon Hyang.

82
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,690
But Mother was at that Buddhist temple.

83
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,690
On top of that, she was helping a weak old woman. She couldn't disappear that fast.

84
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:09,310
In that Buddhist temple, there surely is a secret passage like the one in Do Hwa Jeon or they are conspiring with those monks.

85
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,010
If we take the Head Monk and interrogate him, don't you think he will speak right away?

86
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,390
We can't just forcibly do that.

87
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,150
It's a case regarding the deaths of three government officials.

88
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,400
Why can't we do it?

89
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,230
Bang Ji.

90
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,640
Finding your mother and finding Nameless are not different things,

91
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,940
but you must keep in mind that this is about the great cause.

92
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,600
I understand what you feel so if it's hard for you to be objective.

93
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,740
What about leaving it to us to find your mother?

94
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,230
Brother.

95
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,170
Why are you like that?

96
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,630
Boon Yi.

97
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,830
About Mother.

98
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,590
She's alive.

99
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,110
Who said so?

100
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,250
It's not because someone said so.

101
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,390
I saw her.

102
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,610
In the temple where we followed Gil Seon Mi to,

103
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,460
Mother was there.

104
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,700
- You saw Mom?
- Boon.

105
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,040
Now, we can look for Mother and meet her.

106
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,500
One member of the organization that kidnapped Mother

107
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,610
is being interrogated at the Investigation Bureau.

108
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,080
But the thing is throughout the whole organization,

109
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,560
members only know their direct supervisor.

110
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,520
Still, if we keep on pushing, we'll find something.

111
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,540
We can find her.

112
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,670
I will not give up again.

113
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,090
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

114
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:39,030
Boon Yi, I'm not like I used to be.

115
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,240
Please trust me, Boon. I will surely

116
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,650
break that organization that kidnapped Mother and I will save her.

117
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,060
Brother, still,

118
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,630
we might not have to save her.

119
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,660
What do you mean?

120
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,600
What are you saying, Boon Yi?

121
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,260
Mom

122
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,970
was not kidnapped.

123
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,450
She was not kidnapped.

124
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,750
On that night,

125
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,500
on the night when Mom disappeared, I saw her.

126
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,540
You were sleeping but I saw her.

127
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,460
What did you see?

128
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,010
You said that you didn't know anything back then.

129
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,590
For a long time,

130
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,770
I just thought of it as a dream.

131
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,780
I believed that it was a dream.

132
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,480
 "The one that never existed will always be there." 

133
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,290
 A person with no name 

134
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,040
 will never disappear. 

135
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,070
 Have you been doing well? 

136
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,800
 It's my first time seeing you. 

137
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,180
 Because I'm part of the Chunmyeongjo branch. 

138
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,670
Then, the next day, I heard it.

139
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,600
 Are you done thinking? 

140
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,660
At that time, Mom...

141
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,430
She answered like this.

142
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,710
 I will cut ties with my children. 

143
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,770
Morning came

144
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,840
and we looked for Mom while crying,

145
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,380
but Mom was gone.

146
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
At that time, you told me

147
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,690
that Mom had been taken away.

148
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,770
I

149
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,770
probably wanted to believe what you said.

150
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,060
Mom

151
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,310
didn't abandon us

152
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,490
but she was just taken away.

153
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,150
I think I was hoping it was that.

154
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,920
That's why

155
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,530
I think I wanted to believe in you.

156
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,950
But

157
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:13,130
as I grow older, I remember that time more clearly.

158
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,470
- Mom surely—
- You were probably mistaken.

159
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,570
You were only eight years old back then.

160
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,390
So

161
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,530
when we came to Gaegyeong to find Mom,

162
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,140
you wanted to go home

163
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,400
and told me to stop and just go home.

164
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,800
No, Boon Yi.

165
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,170
You resented not having Mom

166
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,390
so you only made up that memory.

167
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:56,450
No, Brother. Something like that

168
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,060
is too distinct in my memory.

169
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,690
That's why I'm so scared.

170
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,570
I have to find her.

171
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,750
If what you're saying is true,

172
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,290
it's even more reason to find her. Why she did that,

173
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,640
I have to find her and ask.

174
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,670
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

175
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,550
- Let's go.
- Where?
- To that temple.

176
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,480
Clues to find Ajumma will probably be there.
 (Yeon Hee) 

177
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,440
Let's go. If we keep at it all night, we'll be there by morning.

178
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,470
It's not that but I heard what you talked about with your brother.

179
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,900
Even if you pretended that you didn't know, at that young age,
   

180
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,550
it must have been so hard on you.

181
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,240
Since you had to live pretending it was nothing,

182
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,450
it must have hurt so much inside.

183
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,760
You must be feeling very bitter inside.

184
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm sure your mother was

185
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,180
in some kind of dire situation.

186
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,600
Being a mother is like that.

187
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,610
Without being in such a situation, there is no way she could have done that.

188
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,110
Aigoo.

189
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,580
It's okay.

190
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,610
Actually, I can't

191
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,560
remember Ajumma's face well.

192
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,130
It was back when we were young.

193
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,960
Boon Yi said she's scared of finding Mother.

194
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,620
Why?

195
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,050
She thinks that Mother wasn't kidnapped

196
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,810
but left on her own.

197
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,700
Saying she saw it half awake.

198
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,190
It's totally like Boon Yi.

199
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,140
"Mom left because she chose to."

200
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,220
"Let's live our lives well by ourselves."

201
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,520
While looking at you having a hard time,

202
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,780
she probably thought of it that way even more.

203
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,570
So that she can at least take care of her brother faster,

204
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,820
she wanted to work on living.

205
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,330
I vaguely remember Ajumma's face

206
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,980
but I clearly remember thinking

207
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,120
that she definitely didn't abandon you.

208
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,020
Don't press them too much and try to explain it well.

209
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,450
If we explain the importance of this work, the officials of the Ministry of Revenue will understand.

210
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,980
I will explain it clearly

211
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,900
but if they still don't follow,

212
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,080
I will show them their corruption records.

213
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,610
What's going on here? Where did all the Ministry of Revenue officials go?

214
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,330
Not a single person came.

215
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,590
What is this? Those bastards!

216
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,340
We have a big problem.

217
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,150
There's been a big problem. That guy Woo Jae (Jo Joon)

218
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,980
That guy finally...

219
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,360
Let's hurry and go to the Do Dang.

220
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,900
Why are you all looking at me like that?
 (Jo Joon) 

221
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,960
It seems that you did get scared of being impeached.

222
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,690
Look here, Chief Inspector General.

223
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:05,370
If even such a small land expropriation gets charged as a crime, 80% of the Do Dang won't be safe from it.

224
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,900
Yes. So instead of that 80%,

225
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,920
I will only impeach the three of you who are here.

226
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,750
What?

227
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,630
What?

228
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,220
How can you be this unfair?

229
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,620
Yes. I will unfairly impeach you.

230
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:29,950
If you aren't pleased with it, then come into the Do Dang right now!

231
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,540
I've intimidated them, but I'm not sure how they will react.

232
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:48,450
If Po Eun stands up, then the young officials and the Sadaebu's opinions will be changed.

233
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,830
But why is Teacher Po Eun staying silent?

234
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,780
What is this?
 (Yeo Joo: King Woo's house) 

235
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:01,100
Your Majesty, please wait. We are all

236
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:08,450
trying our very best to bring you back into Gaegyeong.

237
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,490
Yes, Your Highness. We're doing our best to get you back to the throne.

238
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,900
The only problem is Lee Seong Gye.

239
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,680
How can this man treat the former king so poorly?

240
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,680
If Lee Seong Gye is gone,

241
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,230
how comfortable would it be for Your Highness.

242
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,000
If he was gone? Did you ask what would happen if Lee Seong Gye was gone?
 (King Woo: Goryeo's 32nd King) 

243
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,150
Yes, Your Highness.

244
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:45,730
Yes. I also wish that he would just disappear.

245
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,970
Your Highness.

246
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,690
What is it again?

247
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,500
I have something to tell you.

248
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,410
By considering your sincerity,

249
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,360
I am thinking of putting my life on the line.

250
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,740
What are you saying?

251
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,190
Please give Lee Seong Gye a royal gift.

252
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,770
Why are you asking me to give him a royal gift all of a sudden?

253
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,920
If you will allow me, I will prepare everything.

254
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,910
What kind of royal gift?

255
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,370
Come in.

256
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,370
Please send him as a royal gift.

257
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,010
What is your name?

258
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,510
I don't have a name. I lived in Guk San,

259
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,340
Mr. Cheok.

260
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,160
Mr. Cheok from Guk San?

261
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,690
Just hearing that, I know which family warrior you are.

262
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,930
Look here.

263
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:32,170
Give him a drink. I will grant him a cup of alcohol.

264
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,630
Do you know?

265
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:48,240
Do you know even a quarter of the suffering I'm going through?

266
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,520
It's a reform that I have dreamed of all my life as well.

267
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,690
But I, Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo, am hesitating with it right in front of my eyes.

268
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,020
Do you know how I feel?

269
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,690
No matter how I think about it, it's treason.

270
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,170
Then why aren't you reporting me?

271
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:23,350
You should go to the Investigation Bureau, and--
No, you should go to the Queen, to the Gwon Moon Sae Jok, and to Teacher Lee Saek

272
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,210
and tell them everything you know.

273
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,430
I can't. I can't ever do that.

274
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,310
If I do that, and cause you and your people to be expelled,

275
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,880
this country will lose the only opportunity of reform and rejuvenation that's come by in several hundred years

276
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,800
and will fall into hell again.

277
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,100
So please join us.

278
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,360
Why are you trying to make me join you?

279
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,090
Are you just worried, because I am not agreeing with you after knowing everything?

280
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,970
Then why don't you just get rid of me before I go report you?

281
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,250
I also can't do that. If we do this, our reform will be shaken by the roots.

282
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,650
The country might become a mess from the start.

283
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:27,550
Colleague... No matter what, I am going to convince you.

284
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:33,750
Even if it takes a long time, I will discuss and debate with you.

285
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,660
But this land reform doesn't have that much time.

286
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,020
If we lose this chance, we don't know how many years it will take.

287
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,760
Can you promise me one thing?

288
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,730
If... I don't become convinced,

289
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:05,130
then don't ever try a thing such as changing the country itself.

290
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,660
Can you promise me that?

291
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,020
I don't know how many more times we have to discuss the same thing.

292
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:31,690
But my thoughts are still that until we find the culprit who caused this and everything is safe,

293
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,420
we should postpone the land survey.

294
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,900
Postpone it? How can we postpone it?

295
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,020
If you are really worried about the safety, then you can just post bodyguards.

296
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:50,950
The young officials who met such an unfortunate death got killed even before they left to survey the lands,

297
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,940
on the day their names were put on the list.

298
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,710
Then do you think the Do Dang and the court have to submit to those evil people?

299
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,410
Who said we have to submit to them?

300
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,630
Postponing it until we find the criminal is the right thing to do.

301
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,850
Just how many more days

302
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,170
are you going to talk about the same thing over and over again?

303
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,470
No matter what you try to do, there's no one who will take the task.

304
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,500
In the end, it's Po Eun. If Po Eun stands up, then his young followers will follow suit.

305
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,550
Why...?

306
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:40,620
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

307
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,430
I will ask the chief overseer.

308
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,930
Yes.

309
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,440
Can you promise me?

310
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,790
 If in the end I don't become convinced, 

311
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,920
 then don't ever try a thing such as changing the country itself. 

312
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,480
 Can you promise that? 

313
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,400
 Are you going to try to convince me until the day I die? 

314
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,510
 Will I be able to convince Po Eun in the end? 

315
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:41,760
Chief Overseer, I asked if you can promise me.

316
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,820
Can you promise me?

317
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:05,940
Yes. I promise.

318
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:20,640
The land survey will proceed.

319
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,250
What?

320
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,990
What are you saying? Who is going to conduct the survey?

321
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,400
Park Chan Hyun, Yoo Moon Sang, Lee Do,

322
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,150
Gwak Jin Gyoon have already volunteered to conduct the land survey.

323
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,450
The land survey will proceed without stop.

324
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,640
However, this time, we'll take special care to guard the officials surveying the lands.

325
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,280
Also, for the Chief Inspector General and the Chief Overseer heading the land reform,

326
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,290
the Do Dang will have to join together to provide support.

327
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,110
Thank you, Po Eun.

328
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,150
All I did was just trust Sam Bong's promise.

329
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,570
I will keep that promise.

330
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,630
From now on, we have to focus on the reformation process without looking back.

331
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,350
Of course. Please help us Po Eun.

332
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:38,450
The reformation has to be performed confidently in the open, instead of in the darkness.

333
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:43,580
Also, it has to be performed, not for personal reasons, but for a fair and just reason.

334
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,500
You are correct.

335
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,620
Do you have any good suggestions?

336
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,460
First of all, get out of that cave.

337
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,600
The heart of the reformation shouldn't be in such a dark place.

338
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,780
Yes. I will think about it.

339
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,290
How about Do Hwa Jeon?

340
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,950
But Do Hwa Jeon has been used by the powerful people to do evil things.

341
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:11,150
If we carry this work out with only fair and just morals,

342
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,810
using Do Hwa Jeon as our base of operations will be symbolic to our cause of changing this sick and rotten country.

343
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:22,690
 Are you that bothered by the words "New Joseon" in that cave? 

344
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,270
Symbolic...

345
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,390
What do you think, Sam Bong?

346
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,830
Yes, I will do that.

347
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,540
I  will  do that.

348
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,850
What? A promise?

349
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,310
A promise? Then what?

350
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,270
What did Sam Bong say?

351
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,690
Because he was nervous, he was just staring,

352
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,430
and finally he said that he promises.

353
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,680
Do you know what it is?

354
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:00,260
Make a guess this time too. What is it?

355
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,260
I don't know what it is,

356
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:08,410
but I think Sam Bong has been caught in a bind.

357
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,290
What? How could you make such a promise?

358
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,870
I just did.

359
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:21,930
Yes... Since we have to resolve the current situation first, and time is of the essence,

360
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,730
I think you did well to work around it.

361
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,850
Work around it? I did it sincerely.

362
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,000
What if you are not able to convince him in the end?

363
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,060
I will convince him.

364
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,620
Since I said I will convince Po Eun till the day I die, I will convince him.

365
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,740
How can this great cause be shaken by one man's thoughts?

366
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,520
It's not just one man's thoughts.

367
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,080
The Sadaebu, the scholars, and the students who all follow Po Eun

368
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,610
will be the foundation and the driving force of the new country we are trying to make.

369
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,010
- But— 
 - In 1375,

370
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,550
when I was creating all these plans and this organization, while I in exile,

371
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,510
Po Eun continued to train younger students and raise talented men.

372
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,870
If all of them turn their backs on us, who will manage the country?

373
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:17,710
We can just raise them again, since new people will continue to be born.

374
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,790
How long does it take to build fortress in the frontier?

375
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,540
Three or four months probably.

376
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,200
Okay, Three or four months is good enough for building a fortress. It takes a year to harvest crops.

377
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,100
At the latest, we can survey all the lands in three years.

378
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,050
We can build another palace like the Royal Palace in five years.

379
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,000
So what?

380
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,900
It takes decades to raise talented men.

381
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,700
What's worse is that if we lose the education that's been built upon and handed down, we'll lose

382
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,750
even more than a hundred years.

383
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,220
What's the point of making a new country,

384
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,020
if we lose a hundred years in the new country and the great plans we have.

385
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,580
If Po Eun has other thoughts, what do we do?

386
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,420
 Residence of Wang Yo (aka Jeong Chang Goon) 

387
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,450
Come hither!

388
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,260
Have you come, Teacher Po Eun?

389
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,320
Is Lord Jeong Chang Goon here?

390
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,020
Yes. Please go in.

391
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,220
My Lord, are you serious?

392
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,390
Yes. Let's get married.

393
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:42,670
Though you are not my first wife, I will sincerely love you and care for you.

394
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,690
Where I was born and raised...

395
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,150
You don't know anything about me.

396
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,850
Then how could you... with someone like me?

397
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:01,870
None of that matters.

398
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,820
My Lord...
 (Yoon Rang) 

399
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,800
When I was young—

400
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Stop it.

401
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,130
In these turbulent times, why does that matter?

402
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,600
I know your dance,

403
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,750
I hear your words, and I know your heart,

404
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,690
so what more do I need?

405
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,800
My Lord...

406
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,170
Elder, Teacher Po Eun is here.

407
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,250
You are going to have a second wife?

408
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,390
Congratulations.

409
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,740
I'm embarrassed.

410
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,510
I don't know my place and I am greedy, so it happened this way.

411
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,070
What do you mean you are greedy?

412
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,470
I heard that there is no one in this residence who is starving.

413
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,670
Isn't it because you look after your people so that the public sentiment leans towards you?

414
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,950
If you think about it, the reason my business is going well is because of the people.

415
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,260
So I just showed a little bit of my gratitude for that.

416
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,570
A person like you who cares for the people should be doing politics.

417
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,650
Don't say such things. Me, in politics?

418
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,770
It's been long since I've forgotten that I am of royal lineage.

419
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:42,270
I can't even remember the last time I've gone into the Royal Palace.

420
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:48,270
What if the current generation wants you?

421
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:01,490
Teacher Po Eun, how could a wise man like you understand me?

422
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,690
My capabilities are nothing more than this.

423
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,610
I just want to live the rest of my life

424
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,950
as one woman's man. I am that kind of person.

425
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,960
 Po Eun... It is to not lose Po Eun. 

426
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,300
 Po Eun will, until the end, 

427
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,500
 keep my Confucian beliefs, 

428
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,440
 and maintain the legitimacy of our reform. 

429
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,150
 I will convince him. Since I've said I will convince him until the day I die, 

430
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,080
 I will do it. 

431
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,900
A royal gift?

432
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,360
Yeah. The previous king in Yeojoo has bestowed a royal gift.

433
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,340
He said to prepare well since it's on the fifth day of the month at mishi (1pm-3pm).

434
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,440
Really?

435
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,580
I guess he is still king even if he abdicated.

436
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,300
 What the— Don't do it like that. 

437
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,110
Teacher Po Eun went inside Jeong Chang Goon's house.

438
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,000
Jeong Chang Goon?

439
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,350
Up until a while ago, Jeong Chang Goon was one of the most likely nominees of the throne.

440
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,530
Why is Po Eun...

441
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,630
To think that we've ended up using Do Hwa Jeon...

442
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,050
Yeah... It feels like a different world.

443
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,010
As you have said, now Do Hwa Jeon

444
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,510
will stand up as the symbol of our reform.

445
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,430
Yes. We will definitely make it happen.

446
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:58,660
Of course. That's why it is very important that you guys survey the land well.

447
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,230
Yes.

448
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,960
Colleague!

449
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,840
What's the matter?

450
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,240
That guy has opened his mouth. I think there's been a change in his state of mind.

451
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,460
There really is nothing unusual about this place.

452
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,700
It's almost weird to see that there's a temple in Goryeo that is so ordinary and without any issues.

453
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:40,020
I also kept watch, but nothing seemed off.

454
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,540
There's no way that the three could all disappear at once without help.

455
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,180
Ddang Sae, let's just go.

456
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,130
I want to stay here.

457
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,680
My mother was here at least a couple of days ago.

458
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,350
Okay.

459
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:10,500
If I disclose anything, I'll die.

460
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,360
We said that we would protect you didn't we?

461
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,700
You won't be able to protect me.

462
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:23,940
If you refuse to reveal any information, then you have no choice than to die painfully.

463
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,570
That could be true too

464
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,270
but besides that I'm putting my hope in another place.

465
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,210
Hope?

466
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:42,440
If I persevere here and don't say anything, then I'll definitely be rescued.

467
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,750
Are you saying that you are going to escape from the Investigation Bureau?

468
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:52,230
If that person so desires, then I will end up leaving.

469
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,840
Lee Bang Ji.

470
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,740
Gil Seon Mi.

471
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:12,740
Just look straight and continue walking. If you look back, then I'll disappear.

472
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,490
You found the wrong place. It has nothing to do with this place.

473
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:31,740
Why were you in a place that has nothing to do with it?

474
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,830
It's not that I was here, but I followed you.

475
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,000
Why did you follow me?

476
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,420
I have something to tell you.

477
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:45,080
I already warned you once not to look for your mother—that if you looked for her then you would die.

478
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:50,370
If there was someone who could kill me, then that could happen.

479
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:54,890
That's right. The situation's changed hasn't it?

480
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:59,530
So I'll give you an opportunity.

481
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,710
You probably want to meet your mother, right?

482
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,390
Where is my mother?

483
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:14,690
Come to Yeoamjeong by mishi (1pm-3pm) on the fifth day of the month. You will be able to meet your mother there.

484
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,730
But I have a condition. First,

485
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,400
you must come alone. Second,

486
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,400
you must not tell anyone of this fact.

487
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,970
If you don't keep these, then you'll never see her.

488
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:37,540
What if I take out my knife and torture you until you tell me correctly

489
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,360
I'm not sure

490
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,390
I'm not confident whether I'll be able to do that to you.

491
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:49,010
But you probably aren't sure that you can either.

492
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,300
I did what you asked, but do we have to go this far?

493
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,860
I guess you aren't really pleased with it.
 (Yook San) 

494
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,710
Is this truly the wish of that person?

495
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:35,150
"Kill the ash tree flower." You know that that's his command.

496
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,410
"Kill the ash tree flower."

497
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:45,320
That's right. He said to cut off the flower on the ash tree before it blossoms.

498
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,870
What if we fail?

499
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,500
Fail?

500
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,610
I'm sure that will be some sort of result, and then we can move to the next step.

501
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,060
Let's go.

502
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:36,720
 Come to Yeoamjeong by mishi (1pm-3pm) on the fifth day of the month. You will be able to meet your mother there. 

503
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:49,620

504
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,000
 I'm scared. 

505
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,600
Teacher Po Eun met Jung Chang Goon.

506
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,300
What?

507
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,980
Teacher Po Eun definitely has other thoughts.

508
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,830
How could you dare follow Teacher Po Eun?

509
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,030
I cannot trust him completely as you do.

510
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:20,740
Whether you trust him or not is not important! I trust him and he trusts me!

511
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,460
Leave all matters related to Teacher Po Eun to me. Don't even take interest in them.

512
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:33,800
Do you understand? Are you not going to answer?

513
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,410
Yes.

514
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,100
We barely stopped his suicide and kept him alive...

515
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,630
Are you talking about the man from Nameless?

516
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,410
Yes. I don't think he will speak any further.

517
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,220
Is there a good method?

518
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:13,600
If there's no method, then we can at least use the one from Yak San.

519
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,240
Yak San?

520
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,630
Yes. We allow them to escape.

521
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,060
Escape?

522
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,650
It might be worth doing.

523
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,130
But why?

524
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:27,200
We can't just keep looking at this one guy, anyway.

525
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,060
I don't know if it will work. But even if doesn't, we'll have stopped wasting our time, and

526
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,820
we can think of another method.

527
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,690
Sure, you lead this then. Don't concern yourself with other things.

528
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,640
Do you understand?

529
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,350
Boon Yi will be coming, so utilize the messenger network.

530
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,000
Yes.

531
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,840
Carry out this plan tonight and come to Do Hwa Jeon  to report the outcome.

532
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,910
Yes I understand.

533
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,190
Did you call for me?

534
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,360
- Follow Bang Won's orders. 
 -Yes.

535
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,290
What are you saying we do?

536
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,670
The plan is simple.

537
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,710
You understand, right?

538
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:26,930
The deployment is done, so you have to take care of it well on your own. Okay?

539
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,500
Huh?

540
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,910
You're not coming?

541
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,700
I have to do something else.

542
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,040
Then.

543
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,790
Excuse me.

544
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,780
Yes. Warrior-nim.

545
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,870
You're weird, my lady.

546
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,450
Why don't you have any strength?

547
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:25,920
If the plan with Nameless goes well, then you can meet your mother whom you haven't seen in about ten years.

548
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,230
Are you not happy about it?

549
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,210
I think I would be.

550
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:42,430
I don't know my mother or father.

551
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:47,960
No, actually I remember until around ten,

552
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,850
and then it became vague and finally disappeared.

553
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,830
At what age did they pass away?

554
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:01,570
When I was around nine, but I actually don't remember very well.

555
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,300
I just remember my grandmother crying.

556
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,320
Where the corpses were, or how it happened,

557
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,120
I don't know anything. Just that they died.

558
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,270
So it would be nice if I saw them once in a dream.

559
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:28,120
It would be really nice. I think that.

560
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:36,560
I would like that too, if you met your mother in your dream.

561
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,220
I will wish that for you.

562
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:48,470
How nice it must be for you that it's not a dream, but reality. You thought your mother was dead but

563
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,300
now you can see her. Must be nice.

564
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,460
Why?

565
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:07,060
You are just sorry to see your mom when I can't ever see my mom, right?

566
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,200
- Warrior-nim. 
 - Yeah?

567
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Did you hear something from Grandma?

568
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:21,600
No. I didn't h-h-hear anything. I don't even talk to my grandma these days.

569
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:26,010
Thank you, Warrior-nim. Really.

570
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,920
You are just trying to comfort me.

571
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,450
You are such a kind person.

572
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,250
Um... It's really not  like that...

573
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:49,170
But I'm really being honest when I say I'm jealous.

574
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:56,150
Whatever is going on with your mom, now there is at least hope that you can see your mom again.

575
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,320
 Hope? 

576
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,220
So why are you like this? If it were any other time, would you have entrusted this task to someone else?

577
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,390
You would have been in the lead, taking care of it yourself.

578
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,730
Seeing you so weak like this is a bit...

579
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:24,450
Get some rest. I will do well in this operation.

580
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:34,990
By the way... Why are you afraid of hope?

581
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,900
I'm really taking my leave.

582
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,510
 You feel very bitter, huh. 

583
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:15,030
 I'm sure your mother was in some kind of dire situation. 

584
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,320
 Being a mother... is all like that. 

585
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,540
 Without being in such a situation, there is no way she could have done that. 

586
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,780
 If what you are saying is right 

587
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:31,580
 then there is even more reason to find her. To ask why she did it, 

588
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,730
 I will find her. 

589
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:41,230
 By the way, why are you afraid of hope? 

590
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,240
 The operation is simple. 

591
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:20,590
 You said that he believes that his organization will come to save him. 

592
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,410
 It's his orders. Get moving. 

593
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,300
Jump over the wall, jump over it, jump over it.

594
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,520
Yes. There you go. Jump over the wall.

595
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,010
Yes! What are you doing?

596
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,580
There's been a jailbreak! Chase after him!

597
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,670
 We have to chase after him. But we mustn't capture him. 

598
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,810
After him!

599
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,080
 We'll lure him into the alleyway on the left side of the Jeongseung-dong crossroads. 

600
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,470
Get him!

601
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:28,010
 Once he finds the cart, he'll try to hide. 

602
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,260
 Moo Hyul, you must let him go in right away. 

603
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:40,310
 Once that happens, I think you can follow behind the cart with agile soldiers in disguise. 

604
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,630
 Let's try that. 

605
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:46,330
 Boon Yi, you should deploy the messenger network in various places around the area just in case something happens. 

606
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,110
 Okay. 

607
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,690
Please hide me.

608
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,010
Get in the back right now.

609
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,060
Sound of swords clashing? What are you doing? Run!

610
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,860
You guys go that way. We'll go this way.

611
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,720
Just who is that guy?

612
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,710
What about that Nameless guy?

613
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,660
I think he ran away while I was fighting.

614
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:12,800
He's disappeared! We are trying to find him but...

615
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,350
Look here.

616
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:38,290
The organization has abandoned me.

617
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:42,810
 Organization? Then this man must be...! 

618
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:48,650
They sent an assassin to kill me.

619
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,550
Even though I didn't say anything...

620
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,430
Even though I've kept my pledge...

621
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,020
Look here. Look here!

622
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:11,230
Please tell the investigation bureau, "Kill the ash tree flower."

623
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,260
 "Kill the ash tree flower"? 

624
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,430
Fifth day of the month.

625
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,610
You've heard something you shouldn't have.

626
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,680
 "The one who never existed will always be there." 

627
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,750
 "The one with no name" 

628
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,660
 "will never disappear." 

629
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,410
 But the thing is, throughout the whole organization, members only know their direct supervisor. 

630
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:11,150
"The one that never existed will always be there."

631
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:18,600
 Cho Moo Ja Moo Jin 
The one that never existed will always be there. 

632
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:24,810
"The one with no name will never disappear."

633
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:45,680
