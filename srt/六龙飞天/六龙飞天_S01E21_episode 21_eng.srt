00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,140
 Episode 21
If we continue this war, you will take 50,000 children to those 100,000 parents. 

3
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,900
 What are you going to do with the blood and tears that you are being like this? 

4
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,270
 General, please save my siblings. 

5
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:09,660
 ...the "guk" character in country is made up of the characters "spear," "land," and "people." This is country. 
(protecting the land and people with a spear) 

6
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,270
 Immediately enact military discipline and execute them. 

7
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,210
 Immediately arrest Kim Hwan! 

8
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,450
 What? 

9
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,540
 I, Lee Seong Gye, will not cross the Yalu River! 

10
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,000
General Lee, what are you doing right now?

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,380
What do you mean you will not cross the Yalu River?

12
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,040
Do you even realize what you are saying?

13
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,490
That means you are going to defy the His Majesty's command.

14
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,160
It's treason!

15
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,280
So carry on His Majesty's orders and march the army!

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,440
Why are you just standing there? Arrest this man right this moment!
 (Lee Seong Gye) 

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,950
Yes, sir!

18
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,950
Let me go, you rascals! I am an inspector here on His Majesty's orders!

19
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,430
Let me go this instant!

20
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,580
Let me go this instant!

21
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,130
Dying from crossing the river, dying from an epidemic; this is all nonsense. 
 (Woo Hak Joo) 

22
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,430
How much effort did we put in raising these soldiers?

23
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,670
We've sent a royal messenger requesting the withdrawal of the army, so we'll soon receive a reply.

24
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,270
We already know what the response will be!

25
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,790
We've been played by General Choi Young ever since he brought up the conquest of Liaodong.

26
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,530
Yes, at this rate we, the Gwon Moon Sae Jok, and Lee Seong Gye will all be taken out,
 (Gwon Moon Sae Jok: group of powerful high ranking people with close relations to the Mongols) 

27
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,650
and only Choi Yeong will be left! Just Choi Yeong!

28
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,390
The Commander of the Right Army is here.

29
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,370
On what business are you here, General Lee?

30
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,780
Eunuch Kim Hwan arrived with His Majesty's decree.

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,180
And? Did His Majesty give permission to withdraw the troops?

32
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,450
I've arrested Kim Hwan.

33
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,180
What are you saying?

34
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,260
Kim Hwan came to order us to cross the river and carry out His Majesty's command.

35
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,190
I cannot cross the Yalu River.

36
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,980
I can't allow for more soldiers to die for no reason.

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,580
Then what is it that you are going to do?

38
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,500
Let's withdraw the army.

39
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,600
How would we, without the royal order?

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,510
With or without the royal order,

41
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,540
I am not going to cross the Yalu River.

42
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,050
You! Are you saying you are going to commit treason?

43
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,670
If saving the 50,000 soldiers,

44
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,840
and saving the people of this country from this calamity is considered treason, then I suppose I'm committing treason.

45
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,920
However, the one who knows the current war situation best is you, General Jo.

46
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,780
You could just as well punish me as a traitor right here,

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,690
and march onward to Liaodong.

48
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,980
It's your choice.

49
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:06,620
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

50
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,200
Then,

51
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,380
let's request a withdrawal one more time.

52
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,520
Even if we send another royal messenger, the response will be the same.

53
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,980
Brother, are you really thinking of withdrawing?

54
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,310
What about the kids? What about the your wife and your kids who are held captive?

55
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,480
Leader B-B-Boon Yi has been captured?

56
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,820
Has all of my family been captured as well?

57
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,060
Yes. The Homeless Gang saw them. And I was able to check only then. 
 (Gab Boon) 

58
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,910
What did the messengers do? No one knew that?
 (Lee Bang Ji) 

59
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,890
D-D-Ddang Sae... The thing is... After that day when our plan was canceled,

60
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,760
everyone was feeling a little down...

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,180
Have you looked into it?

62
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,590
In Seogyeong they've covered it up,

63
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,540
but in Gaegyeong, there is a rumor passing among the nobles.

64
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,510
What?

65
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,970
The generals in Wihwa Island made two requests to withdraw the army, but were rejected both times.
 Yeon Hee 

66
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,710
Request for withdrawal?

67
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,180
Teacher, if that's so...

68
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,250
What about the family?

69
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,790
We save them, of course.

70
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:32,710
Yes, we have to save them. We don't know how the situation will play out. We have to save them quickly. 
 (Sam Bong -Jeong Do Jeon) 

71
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,980
 General Choi Yeong rejected the request for withdrawl
(Min Da Gyeong, later Queen Wongyeong) 

72
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,160
 and put the family in isolation. 

73
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,050
 Choi Yeong must be feeling anxious.   

74
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,080
 Is Father-in-law perhaps planning on doing something? 

75
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,270
 Then we have to somehow let someone on the outside know of our situation 

76
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,970
Excuse me, miss.

77
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,630
What's the matter?

78
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,250
Last night, didn't you meet Min Jae?
 (Boon Yi) 

79
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,850
Did you hear any news by any chance?

80
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,450
General Lee Seong Gye requested the troops be withdrawn,

81
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:46,500
but General Choi Yeong rejected it and sent someone to Wihwa Island in order to urge the march.

82
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,490
Then the reason Moon Ha Shi Joong Choi Yeong has put us in isolation is because...

83
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,550
Because?

84
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,360
Because he is anxious enough not to have trust in General Lee Seong Gye.

85
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,030
Then if something happens that makes his fears come true,

86
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,030
we have to make sure we don't get in the way.

87
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,550
 Is this wench thinking the same thing as I? 

88
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,510
We have to let Young Master Bang Won know our location no matter what.

89
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,550
Bang Suk... Bang Suk!

90
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,000
What's going on?

91
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,360
We even went away on a trip to get medical treatment for his asthma,

92
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,200
but we were brought here in such a hurry we don't have a lot of medicine left.

93
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,140
It's not something we can get just anywhere...

94
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,250
Well, in that case, please give me the prescription.

95
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,990
I'll try asking the soldiers.

96
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,530
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

97
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,450
Um, by the way...

98
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,770
Does Young Master Bang Won know of Young Master Bang Suk's illness as well?

99
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,350
He does, but why do you ask?

100
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,070
Then does he also know that the medicine is not something it can be acquired anywhere?

101
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,330
Yes, he also knows that.

102
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,960
Yes, that's it. Let's try that.

103
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,770
Yes. If it's Young Master Bang Wong, then he'll be looking for us and will remember it.

104
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,940
Tell them outside to go get some medicine.

105
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,900
By doing that, we can let our location be known.

106
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,880
Teacher, Bang Suk has a bad case of asthma,

107
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,660
so he needs medicine made from a walnut.

108
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:52,110
A walnut? It hasn't been that long since it's been produced in Goryeo, so it's not very common.

109
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,830
Yes. We can try betting on that. How much of the medicine is left?

110
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,750
When I saw it last, there were only about 20 bags.

111
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,080
Then, by tomorrow they'll be out of medicine.

112
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,900
That is correct, Teacher.

113
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,880
They might try to acquire more medicine.

114
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,660
There are probably only about five doctors in Gaegyeong that can sell the walnut.

115
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,760
Yes, let's do that.

116
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,570
Make a request of him to meet me.

117
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:40,000
Your Majesty, Moon Ha Shi Joong, High Commander Choi Yeong is entering.

118
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,340
Have they crossed to Liaodong?

119
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,240
Your Highness, please give me permission to go to battle.

120
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,800
Why are you saying that again?

121
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Lee Seong Gye and Jo Min Soo had arrested Kim Hwan and sent a third request to withdraw the troops.

122
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,380
What?

123
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,940
The movements in the battlefield have been serious anyway.

124
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,900
I think I need to personally go and lead the battle. Please give me permission to go.

125
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,660
I already told you that you can't do that.

126
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,480
Your Highness!

127
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,560
In Goryeo's government there's only you and I that are supporting the conquest of Liaodong.
 (King Woo, 32nd King of Goryeo)   

128
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,900
Do you think that I didn't know that?

129
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,600
But, you are just going to leave only me in Seogyeong?

130
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,020
Have you already forgotten how my father, the previous king, faced his demise?

131
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,980
He died during the time you went to Tamra Island (Jeju Island).

132
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,360
But Your Highness, if we just leave it like this, we cannot predict what will happen!

133
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,200
That's why I told you to make preparations.

134
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,780
I told you to take Lee Seong Gye's family as hostage.

135
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,220
Didn't you say that Lee Seong Gye will put his family first more than anything? Everyone says so.

136
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,020
Lee Seong Gye will never abandon his family.

137
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,300
Lee Seong Gye is not capable of harboring different thoughts.

138
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,760
Even if Jo Min Soo will asks to withdraw the troops, Lee Seong Gye will stop it.

139
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,920
So don't think of leaving my side

140
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,260
and send another command to them.

141
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,680
Tell them that if they don't march forward, it will be considered treason.

142
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,340
Are you saying that they rejected it again?

143
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Yes.

144
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,920
He sent a threat that if they don't advance this time, it will be considered treason.

145
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,760
The Japanese Pirates are active in the North side again.

146
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,680
How can he be this stubborn...

147
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,980
From the start, this has been a reckless battle.

148
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,280
Yes. His Highness is being too much.

149
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,560
It's not the King but General Choi Yeong who's being too much.

150
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,780
It's not the time for us to be doing this too.
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

151
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,920
We have to raise an appeal now saying how impossible this battle is.

152
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,840
Will it work if we raise an appeal?

153
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,340
Right now, it doesn't matter if it will work or not.

154
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,260
For the Generals in Wihwa Island to be able to withdraw the troops, we need to establish public opinion

155
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,420
that withdrawing the troops is not treason.

156
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,700
Are you saying that it is possible to withdraw the troops without the royal command?

157
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,180
That won't work so...

158
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,080
Something is strange.

159
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
What's wrong?

160
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,060
The soldiers are whispering among themselves that Father and General Jo Min Soo
 (Lee Bang Gwa) 

161
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,140
arrested the King's envoy who went to Wihwa Island.

162
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,560
Is that true?

163
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,060
Yes. They are also moving us to a prison.

164
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,320
Just like what Father predicted, advancing will be difficult.
 (Lee Bang Woo) 

165
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,220
Something that has been impossible from the start...

166
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,320
We must not become a burden to Father. We need to be prepared.

167
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,260
Yes, Hyungnim.

168
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,660
General! We do not have a way anymore!
 (Wihwa Island) 

169
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,520
Now that His Highness has rejected all our requests, the only option is to withdraw the troops!

170
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,460
I will withdraw the troops. Make preparations.

171
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
- Yes!
- Yes!

172
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,700
What are you saying? We cannot do this.

173
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,140
Are you not listening, Hyung-nim? Your family are being held hostage right now.

174
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,260
You're withdrawing?

175
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,320
Are you really planning to get your whole family killed?
 (Lee Ji Ran) 

176
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,020
Can you live after getting your family killed?

177
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,200
The Hyung-nim I know is not this kind of person. Aren't you someone who couldn't live after doing that?

178
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,180
Then, do I look like someone who can live after getting 50,000 soldiers killed?

179
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,720
Without doing this, it's only obvious what calamity the people will face.

180
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,660
Do I look like someone who can live while looking at that?

181
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,860
I will withdraw the troops. Don't say anything further!

182
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,920
In the end, our third request to withdraw has been rejected.

183
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,520
What shall we do now?

184
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:19,960
General Lee looks sure about his decision. We also need to decide quickly.

185
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,970
My troops will also withdraw.

186
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:31,630
However, that's not the end but the beginning.

187
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,390
That's why I'm thinking of the next move.

188
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,290
Next move? What is that?

189
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,030
If my troops and General Lee's troops come into power

190
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,850
after going back to Gaegyeong with 50,000 soldiers,

191
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,260
who will hold on to that power?

192
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,680
It will be Lee Seong Gye and I.

193
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,070
Before deciding on withdrawing the troops,

194
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,330
I need to consult with General Lee Seong Gye.

195
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,950
What consultation are you talking about?

196
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,340
Still, I learned about one thing.

197
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,870
What?

198
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,140
I thought that there was no connection between me and the affairs of the Do Dang.

199
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,770
But?

200
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,580
What do you mean, but?

201
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,390
This...

202
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,840
There's a big connection.
 (Moo Hyul) 

203
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,730
If the Do Dang decides to go to war,

204
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,720
people like us have to go without knowing if we will live or die,

205
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:50,140
and we wouldn't know what would happen to our families.

206
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,720
Aigoo, aigoo. You're thinking of something great.

207
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,110
That's something everyone finds out after learning how to walk, aigoo.
 (Jo Young Gyu) 

208
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,690
So I've decided to live for a person that can really make that kind of decisions at Do Dang.

209
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,100
A person who can make that kind of decision?

210
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,130
Who is that? The General?

211
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,980
No. It's Young Master Bang Won.

212
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,850
Young Gyu, Moo Hyul! Come with me for a bit.

213
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

214
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,690
What? Withdrawing the troops?

215
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,450
Can't you be more quiet?

216
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,220
Is that the general's decision?

217
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,090
That's right.

218
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,290
So Young Gyu, go to Gaegyeong and relay this news to Bang Won.

219
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,250
Whatever method you use, you must save Sister-in-law and the children.

220
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,030
Yes, I understand.

221
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,530
- Moo Hyul.
- Yes?

222
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,150
Go to Seogyeong and let Bang Woo and Bang Gwa know about this.

223
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,530
You must help them escape from that place.

224
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,670
Yes. I entrust my younger sibling to you.

225
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:13,490
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

226
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,630
Have you decided?

227
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,930
What will you do?

228
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,630
Before I give you my answer,

229
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,930
please tell me what kind of plan you have after withdrawing the troops.

230
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,600
As you already know, General Choi Yeong is the person

231
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,670
who was most eager to do the Liaodong conquest and to push the people into disaster.

232
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,760
So, after withdrawing, we will build a military camp close to Gaegyeong

233
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,490
and send a petition to impeach General Choi Yeong to His Highness...

234
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,150
That,

235
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,260
cannot be so.

236
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,540
I will tell you one condition I have regarding the withdrawal of the troops.

237
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,880
What is it?

238
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:11,040
If we just let His Highness be, he will surely retaliate over our withdrawal. That's why we need to have a different King.

239
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,630
If you won't agree to that, I will not withdraw my troops.

240
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,990
Assemble the soldiers.

241
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,940
My 50,000 sons!

242
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,820
Today, to our families who are waiting for us,

243
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,030
we will go back!

244
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,820
 Yes!

T-There, there!

262
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,010
Lee Seong Gye's army of 50,000 has withdrawn.

263
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,000
It's treason! It's treason!

264
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,900
Light up the beacon! The beacon!

265

Light up the beacon!

266

Ah, what kind of dream was that?

267
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,390
 General, General! 

268
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:01,430
 Lee Seong Gye... Lee Seong Gye! I will definitely...! 

269
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,790
What are you talking about? The army withdrew?

270
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,100
Lee Seong Gye...This man has finally gone against the royal order!

271
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,220
Your Majesty, all of this is my fault.

272
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,110
This irreversible mistake... Please ask for me to pay for my sins later on.

273
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,910
What are we going to do now?

274
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,530
We have to return to the palace in Gaegyeong immediately.

275
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,810
Also we have to gather up all the scattered troops in the south.

276
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,220
We have to stop the rebels, Lee Seong Gye and Jo Min Soo, and protect the the country, Your Majesty!

277
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,620
Oh my, oh my.

278
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,180
Where have you put Lee Seong Gye's family that have been put in isolation in Gyegyeong?

279
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,520
I've put them in a remote area with few inhabitants.

280
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,340
When they hear of the withdrawal, Lee Seong Gye's followers will try to rescue the family members.

281
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,370
Move them to a safer place!

282
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:02,510
When I return to Gaegyeong, I will put them on top of the castle walls of Manwoldae as hostages!

283
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,600
Yes, Your Majesty!

284
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,390
Also,

285
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,860
aren't Lee Seong Gye's first and second sons in Seogyeong right now?

286
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,200
We've put them in isolation inside the castle, but since the first son Lee Bang Woo is a famous warrior, I was worried,

287
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,620
so I've ordered that they be put in jail.

288
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,640
No need for that.

289
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,750
Just execute the first son and the second son right away!

290
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,760
Do you mean right now?

291
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,800
Cut off Lee Seong Gye's sons' heads right now,

292
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,720
and hang them at the front gates!

293
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,600
I'll have them shown right before Lee Seong Gye's eyes as the army returns.

294
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,750
 Stop! 

295
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,590
Is there a problem? You said we'll be moving to a different place to stay. Which place is it?

296
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,550
Oh, I must have been mistaken.

297
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,260
Let's go through the side way. It's on the inside of the Seogyeong Castle.

298
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,360
What are you talking about?

299
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:32,390
Capture them! It's the royal order to have them executed, to have their heads cut off and hung!

300
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,270
Have our heads cutoff and hung?

301
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,080
Do you not understand my orders?

302
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,900
Haven't I said we need walnuts?

303
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,990
Madam, forgive me, but–

304
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,180
My son is suffering an illness.

If he doesn't take his medicine on time and something bad happens to him, how will you take responsibility for that?

306
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,460
Who is my son? He's General Lee's son!

307
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,750
Once he comes back from conquering Liaodong, will you be able to take what he will do to you later?

308
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,110
One of you can just go to the clinic.

309
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,020
Yes, I understand. What type of medicine should I get?

310
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,300
Make sure to get a medicine with walnut according to this prescription.

311
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,150
Stay still.

312
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,690
Do you have walnut here?

313
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,690
Oh yes, it is, but why?

314
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,100
Please get me some of this medicine.

315
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,590
Who is it for?

316
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,870
A seven-year-old child.

317
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,400
Brother! Brother, I found it!

318
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,920
Looking at the soldiers surrounding a private house, there's no doubt that they are there.

319
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,720
How many soldiers are there?

320
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,500
It looks like there are approximately twenty people.

321
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,760
Can you do it?

322
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,740
Of course.

323
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,100
Elder Bon Won!

324
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,690
General Lee Seong Gye arrested Kim Hwan who went there to pressure them about the crossing.

325
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,930
After that, he sent a request for withdrawal

326
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,890
but His Highness has rejected it again.

327
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,950
He arrested Kim Hwan and asked for a withdrawal of the troops?

328
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,330
But he got rejected again so what can he do?

329
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,630
No. If he already arrested Kim Hwan...

330
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,400
What should we do?

331
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,640
Father arrested His Highness' envoy?

332
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,000
He probably couldn't cross the Yalu River with the soldiers.

333
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,400
But His Highess and General Choi Yeong's will is strong. If it comes to this...

334
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,140
It will be difficult to advance or to retreat.

335
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,630
In the end, Father couldn't cross the Yalu River and he is worried about his family.
 (Lee Bang Won) 

336
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:07,140
He can't disobey His Highness' will so he will be stuck in Wihwa Island.

337
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,690
It's a critical situation so they took the hostages?

338
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,510
Then...

339
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,810
Boon Yi will be in more danger.

340
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,400
We have to save them whatever method we use.

341
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,800
It's in Do Hwa Jeon!

342
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,430
Leader Boon Yi and the general's family were all taken to Do Hwa Jeon.

343
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,990
No you can't. There are a few hundred soldiers there.

344
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,720
It seemed like General Ahn's first troop was stationed all over Dohwajun.

345
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,670
But I still have to go.

346
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,690
What are you planning to do?

347
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,650
I have to save them.

348
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,110
Didn't you hear? There are a few hundred there!

349
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,710
Then...

350
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,740
What about Boon Yi? What are you going to do about your family members?

351
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,990
There's no one here who is not anxious.

352
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:08,670
You think I'm not worried about Boon Yi?

353
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,820
But if we act even a little bit recklessly and mess it up,

354
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,120
they will kill not only my mother and brothers,

355
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,940
but your sister as well.

356
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,720
Then what do you suggest we do? Just wait here?

357
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,740
Stop it.

358
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,640
No matter how distressed we are, do you think it can even compare to how the general is feeling?

359
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,280
He considers his family the most important of everything.

360
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,640
You guys also probably know he considers the lives of his soldiers as important as his family.

361
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,500
For such a person to repeatedly request for the withdrawal of troops means that

362
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,920
he is put in a horrible situation where

363
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,860
he has to decide between his family's lives and his soldiers' lives.

364
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,310
He has chosen the lives of the 50,000 soldiers.

365
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,590
General has decided to save the lives of the 50,000 soldiers.

366
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:27,690
So you are going to have to save the general's family.

367
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,450
What are you saying? And how are you here?

368
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:36,030
General Lee Seong Gye and General Jo have withdrawn from Wihwa Island.

369
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,930
He has decided. He sends his deep apologies to his family.

370
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,030
So, where are they currently located?

371
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,350
By now, they have probably crossed Daedong River with the 50,000 soldiers.

372
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:07,330
You rascals! What on earth is going on? How dare–

373
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,410
Shut up, wench!

374
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,010
Lee Seong Gye has defied the royal order and withdrawn his army from Wihwa Island.

375
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,490
Therefore, you wenches and rascals are now the family of a rebel.

376
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,830
For now, we have decided to confine you in Dohwajun, so enjoy the last days of your life.

377
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,190
You guys guard this area securely.

378
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,510
 - Yes.
- Yes. 

379
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,850
- Aigoo!
- Ah...

380
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,650
- Aigoo!
- Ow...!

381
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,430
 Gaegyeong Manwoldae 
I will personally command the Yongho Army to protect His Majesty. The Eungyang Army shall reinforce the castle gates

382
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,550
and put up fences on all paths to the palace.

383
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,490
 Yes. 

384
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,610
At the current speed of the withdrawing army, they will arrive at Gaegyeong very soon.

385
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:20,230
So position the troops coming from the south to defend the four gates.

386
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,450
 - Yes.
- Yes. 

387
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,790
And you guys put up recruitment notices everywhere.

388
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,750
Since the greater cause is with us, the commoners will follow.

389
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,180
 - Yes.
- Yes. 

390
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,850
Where are Lee Seong Gye's family right now?

391
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,570
We've locked them inside with General Ahn's troops that are stationed at the Dohwajun.

392
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,370
Young Lord, you have to calm down.

393
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,190
Please stop crying.

394
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:13,650
Young Lord, Young Lord. Look at me.

395
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:20,490
Young Master, your father is returning right now.

396
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,130
Father?

397
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:28,390
Yes, your father is saving and helping many people.

398
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:34,010
For your father, we must escape this place and live.

399
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,310
You know brother Bang Won?

400
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,470
I know.

401
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,590
Brother Bang Won definitely knows that we are in this place.

402
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,840
How?

403
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,550
Because our people are in every place of Gaegyeong.

404
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,970
They must have seen us coming in here.

405
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,710
Therefore, they will definitely come save us.

406
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:10,390
But. But if Young Master keeps crying like this, they will be on alert,

407
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,230
so it will be harder to get out of here.

408
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,830
So, you have to wait bravely.

409
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,530
Okay.

410
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,590
Do you really think that your people know?

411
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:29,250
Yes. The problem is that there are too many soldiers in here

412
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,330
and that there are too many people to save.

413
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:39,170
So we need to figure out a way as well.

414
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,470
If General Ahn's first troop is stationed at Dohwajun,

415
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,730
then we can't go through them on our own.

416
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,030
There's no time, no time at all.

417
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:56,630
If the general arrives closer to Gaegyeong, the lives of the family will be at risk.

418
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,190
We have to save them before then.

419
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,790
Brother! It's Gaegyeong.

420
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,990
It's General Choi Yeong's message.

421
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,590
 If you stop the army and plead guilty, then you will be forgiven, 

422
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:03,750
 but if you end up arriving at Gaegyeong, your family will be put up on top of the castle walls. 

423
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,050
 I hope that you do not make the wrong choice. 

424
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,750
What's the matter, General?

425
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,050
Let me see.

426
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:22,490
Damn it! I knew it!

427
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,730
Right, that's it!

428
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:34,570
 Jeez. Because of you, Bon Won, while I was a spy for Lee In Gyeom, I experienced something interesting. 

429
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,390
 Experienced something interesting? 

430
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,630
 There's a secret passage in Dohwajun
(Nam Eun) 

431
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,970
 It's connected directly to Lee In Gyeom's office. It was pretty amazing. 

432
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,640
 It's something that Lee In Gyeom would do. A secret passage, huh. 

433
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,030
Yes, yes.

434
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,950
There's a secret passage in Dohwajun. Nam Eun used that passage to meet Lee In Gyeom.

435
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,350
A secret passage?

436
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:03,150
That passage will be it. We can invade through there and just bam! Where is it?

437
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,550
Nam Eun will know, but since he isn't here...

438
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:11,290
Teacher Nam Eun isn't in Gaegyeong, and Lee In Gyeom isn't in Gaegyeong either.

439
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,150
Is there no one who knows of that passage?

440
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,050
There is one more in Gaegyeong who knows of the passage.

441
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,090
Who?

442
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,830
 In that room, I met with Cho Young of Hwa Sa Dan 

443
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,530
 It seemed like Cho Young was using that passage as well. 

444
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,290
Cho Young.

445
00:39:53,470 --> 00:40:00,520
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

446
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,940
You must be hungry, so please eat.

447
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:24,000
Thank you. Are you the butler of Dohwajun?

448
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,020
Please tell me. How are things looking outside?

449
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,500
A little–

450
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,440
I cannot do that, forgive me.

451
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,330
What are you thinking about?

452
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:55,150
Is there an incense in this room that we can light up?

453
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,850
Right here, why?

454
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:08,170
This place... It's strange.

455
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,060
What exactly is strange?

456
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,680
Please open the door and ask them to bring us water.

457
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,200
Look here. How can you just give us food? You have to give us water with it!

458
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,340
You should really have common sense and bring us water!

459
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,490
We will bring it to you so go in.

460
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,990
It's this direction.

461
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,380
There's an empty space behind this wall.

462
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,300
I think there is ventilation.

463
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,860
Usually, when it's poorly constructed, wind would go in.
 (Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's Grandmother) 

464
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,120
Do you think that Do Hwa Jeon is poorly constructed?
 (Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master) 

465
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,770
Wait!

466
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,010
That ring. What is it?

467
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,380
Is it a drawer?

468
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,570
Drawer?

469
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:33,890
It's not. It's not a drawer. It's not opening.

470
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,120
Then push it.

471
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,200
 Push it. 

472
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,020
- Well?
- It didn't budge.

473
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,410
Push it harder!

474
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,320
Here.

475
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:03,420
I heard that there's a secret passage to go into Do Hwa Jeon.

476
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,640
Please tell me about it.

477
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,090
I'm not sure.

478
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,010
Is there a secret passage?

479
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:20,060
Looking at your eyes, it doesn't seem like you won't sell it.

480
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,140
"Raise the price a bit more." Is that what it is?

481
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:30,620
Just like I heard, you are intelligent.
 (Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan's Owner) 

482
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,460
But what can I do? I don't have any property right now.

483
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,360
No.

484
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,220
At a time like this, when there's a battle between General Lee Seong Gye and General Choi Yeong,

485
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:50,770
if I tell General Choi Yeong that I got you as a hostage,

486
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,410
I will get an enormous wealth for it.

487
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:57,160
How does that sound?

488
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:06,580
It seems that you think that Father will lose

489
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,480
so you're choosing General Choi Yeong.

490
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:17,510
If you will foolishly act like that,

491
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,290
this Hwa Sa Dan will close down soon.

492
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:28,380
Why? I will make it so.

493
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:35,200
I actually didn't come to buy information.

494
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,650
I came to get paid for your debt.

495
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:43,790
Debt? Have I ever been indebted to you?

496
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:49,570
How do you think I knew that you are aware of the secret passage in Do Hwa Jeon?

497
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,760
Like you, another person

498
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,100
who used that secret passage said so.

499
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,450
That's what I'm saying.

500
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,980
That time when I was at the brink of death at the Investigation Bureau,

501
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:16,540
you left a fake letter in my room to kill me.

502
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,620
If I died because of that, it wouldn't have been a debt

503
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:28,080
but I am alive so it obviously becomes your debt to me.

504
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,190
The person you are indebted to

505
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,140
is the son of General Lee Seong Gye

506
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,540
who is leading an army of 50,000 soldiers.

507
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,790
You can pay that debt with your life.

508
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:53,620
I, Lee Bang Won, am now willing to write off that debt for a cheap price.

509
00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:00,670
Also, I have a recommendation.

510
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:07,300
What do you think is the most important choice in life?

511
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:13,590
That's choosing your enemy.

512
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,190
Among our family and slaves held hostage in Do Hwa Jeon right now

513
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:23,410
is the sister of Lee Bang Ji, the best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms.

514
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,060
If you don't tell me about the secret passage,

515
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,580
you choose to be enemies with the best swordsman in the country.

516
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,920
 Alright, thank you. Thank you. 

517
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,150
 If that's a door, then that is a knob... If we can't pull or push it, then... 

518
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,330
 The only thing left to do is to turn it! 

519
00:46:54,330 --> 00:47:00,440
 I can imagine that I am this kind of a genius! 

520
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,830
I figured it out! That!

521
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:08,890
- Turn it.
- Turn it.

522
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,310
- Turn it.
- Turn it.

523
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,920
- Turn it.
- Turn it.

524
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,040
I'm not the only one who knew?

525
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,100
Let's quickly get out.

526
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,950
No, you musn't.

527
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,930
We're not even sure where this leads to. It could be blocked or soldiers might be on the other side.

528
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,090
Then what shall we do?

529
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,300
So ajussi, please go out first and check the situation.

530
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,790
Ajussi... Me? Why me–

531
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,070
Dongsaeng, you are the only man here.

532
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:10,960
Dongsaeng! From the start, I have believed in your Twin Dragons.

533
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,880
Noonim, that Twin Dragons—

534
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,270
- Dongsaeng, go!
- Noonim!

535
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,730
Please tie up and lock the door.

536
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,420
 If you go to the opposite side of Do Hwa Jeon and go in the road to the right, 

537
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:47,480
 there is an empty house. If you go into the first shed inside, 

538
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,290
 there is a door to the secret passage. 

539
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,890
The rebel forces of traitor Lee Seong Gye have reached the outskirts of Gaegyeong.

540
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,070
There has been a royal command to transfer Lee Seong Gye's family and slaves

541
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,360
to the palace and put them on top of the wall.

542
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,640
- Bring them there!
- Yes.

543
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,300
It's connected to a shed in a distinguished family's house but it's empty! There's no one there.

544
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,180
So I think we can get out of here now.

545
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,900
Yes. Please make haste. Now!

546
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,510
Let's get out, quickly.

547
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,700
 Everyone come out! 

548
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:31,160
 It's a royal command to bring you to the palace and set you up on top of the walls. 

549
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,880
Carry the Young Masters on your back.

550
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,510
Hurry and carry him, Dongsaeng!

551
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,990
Young Master, please come this way!

552
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,270
 - Come out! 
- Please wait just one more minute.

553
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,130
 These rascals... 

554
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,450
What are you going to do?

555
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,020
I will hold him off for as long as I can.

556
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,280
Once I get out, I'll make sure to send someone.

557
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,580
 Hurry and open the door! 

558
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:15,110
Please excuse us. The two Young Masters are changing their pants.

559
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,190
Why are you in such a rush? Please just wait a bit.

560
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,130
What? Changing pants? These traitors are even making demands!

561
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:28,890
We will put you up on top of the walls and behead you in front of Lee Seong Gye.

562
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:34,070
Yes. Yes, that's right. So please wait just a little longer.

563
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,670
It's not like we're going to escape from here.

564
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,150
This wench. Move, wench!

565
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,740
T-This... What's going on here?

566
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,770
- We're safe.
- We're here...

567
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,910
What is Boon Yi doing?

568
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,790
We need to quickly get out and let them know. That's how we can save Boon Yi.

569
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,490
- Mother.
- Bang Won.

570
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,270
- My dear.
- Husband.

571
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,660
What about Boon Yi?

572
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,200
She wasn't able to get out because she let us escape.

573
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,420
Is she still inside Do Hwa Jeon?

574
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,450
 Wench! Where did they escape?! 

575
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,220
Where the hell did they go?!

576
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,780
I don't know. I don't know!

577
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,980
This wench!

578
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,070
I'll ask you one last time.

579
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:31,970
If you don't confess, I will kill you and we can just search for them.

580
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,610
Where did those traitors escape to?

581
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:41,060
I said I didn't know.

582
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,470
This little son of a...

583
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:54,820
 Will I... just die like this? 

584
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,500
 This girl, my goodness. 

585
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,050
 I will cut this wench's head off. 

586
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,640
 But... Why does it seem like I'm not going to die? 

587
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:59,440
Quickly go. Quickly.

588
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,060
Boon Yi. Boon Yi.

589
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,180
It's alright, Boon Yi. Wake up, please?

590
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,570
Wake up, Boon Yi!

591
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:52,730
Boon Yi! Please come to your senses!

592
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,910
Open your eyes.

593
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:08,110
Are you... Are you alright?

594
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:10,350
Do you think I'm alright?

595
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:18,250
Thank you. You saved my family.

596
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,400
It's because they're your family.

597
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:36,460
♫  You rise by becoming the light in the sky  ♫

598
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,850
♫  I recognized you a number of times  ♫

599
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,460
♫  Because of you, I'm alive  ♫

600
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,750
♫  Your voice,  ♫

601
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,850
I'm sorry, Brother.
♫  I follow it restlessly  ♫

602
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,130
Don't be sorry.

603
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,000
Even if it's a hundred or a thousand times,

604
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,150
I will save you.

605
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,000
We need to follow the mountain path and escape to the outskirts of Gaegyeong.

606
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,320
Everything is set.

607
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,400
How are Bang Won and Boon Yi?

608
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,480
We cannot leave Boon Yi inside Do Hwa Jeon.

609
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,700
That's right.

610
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,880
Young Master!

611
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,340
- Boon Yi!
 - Boon Yi! 

612
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,780
Aigoo, Boon Yi, what happened to you?

613
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,110
Aigoo. What happened to your arm?

614
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,430
I'm fine.

615
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,440
Okay, okay. Let's save those for later.

616
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,150
Now, let's all go.

617
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,110
No. I will stay.

618
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,550
I will also stay.

619
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,120
Boon Yi.

620
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:51,680
Brother. I have to stay here and do something.

621
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,440
We must not waste more time. Why did you stop the army?

622
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,540
The more we delay, the more justification General Choi Yeong will have.

623
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,660
I'm saying that the troops in the North are coming back.

624
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,810
By chance, are you being like this because of your family who are held hostage?

625
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:18,050
I understand. Let's send an appeal and advance.

626
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,670
Let's see each other inside the royal court.

627
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,900
Father!

628
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,430
General!

629
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,700
Moo Hyul!

630
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,370
General.

631
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:13,560
My dear. Bang Seok.

632
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,420
Everyone's safe. Everyone...

633
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,930
How about Bang Won?

634
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:32,550
This is a letter from Young Master Bang Won.

635
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:42,110
 I will try to support your attempt to stop a bloodshed tragedy with what little power I have. 

636
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:46,310
 So you must surely succeed. 

637
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:51,690
Of course, I have to succeed.

638
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,470
I have to win.

639
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:10,560

 Break down the Songui Gate! 

642
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,300
 You cannot break this corruption, General. 

643
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,310
 Do you think you can break it? 

644
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,560
 There is a strange song spreading in the marketplace. 

645
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,050
 Shippalja Wiwang? 
(Eighteen Sons Become the King) 

646
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,370
 Doesn't it mean that the Lee Family will become the King? 
(The Chinese characters for 'Eighteen Sons' look like the Chinese character for 'Lee' when arranged in a certain way) 

647
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,710
 Now, all of the men of power will be on alert because of General Lee. 

648
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,600
 Just who is it? What kind of people? 

649
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,100
 Perhaps...?
