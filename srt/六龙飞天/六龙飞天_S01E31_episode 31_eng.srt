00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,660
 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,920
 The last one is that none of the royal family
Episode 31 

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,000
 will be allowed to participate in politics under any circumstances. 

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,360
 Once the country is founded, all the rights and power will be taken from the king's kindred they will become unable to do anything. 

5
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,200
 By doing so, we'll stop them from doing things on their own authority. 

6
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:21,760
 Making people smile and making your dreams come true. 

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,910
 How? 

8
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,060
 Through politics. Politics that will protect your dreams and will make the people smile. 

9
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,940
 Right. Make sure to practice politics that will give the people happiness in their lives. 

10
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,300
 Being helpless. That's something you just can't stand. 

11
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,620
Let's go.

12
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,330
No power will be inherited?

13
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,980
Right. It will also will be checked and verified by the other Sadaebu.

14
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,970
That kind of prime minister will be the focus, and the king will only have the authority to choose a prime minister. Is that what you are saying?

15
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,990
Yes.

16
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,420
That's why I believe that only you can be the prime minister of the country we're going to establish.

17
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,950
Also, the success or failure of the country

18
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,160
will not be decided by the king Lee Seong Gye but by you, the first prime minister.

19
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,900
Will the current king of Goryeo accept a system like this?

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,830
Yes. Even if the king accepts it, tradition is more scary than the system.

21
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,170
The tradition of the king holding power, that has been passed down for hundreds of years, won't be destroyed that easily.

22
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,540
General Lee Seong Gye is different from Goryeo's kings and will accept the job.

23
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,850
He knows shame, sees the importance of command,

24
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,260
and cherishes the people. He's more of a Confucian scholar than any other.

25
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,950
That's right. He's that kind of person.

26
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:07,100
In any case, after a country is founded, there comes a period of invasions, and after a road of death comes  turbulent times.

27
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,590
Goryeo's system, which is already nearing the end, is at the point of killing many people.

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,910
The system only remains by name but it's been a long time since it disappeared.

29
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,550
It's been long since we've been in this turbulent age, and the people are crying for a new country.

30
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,930
If this isn't the heaven's command that been spoken of in Confucianism, then what is?

31
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,570
Please...

32
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,850
Please be the first prime minister of this new country.

33
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,670
Please, please...

34
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,960
Please accept this lacking student's sincerity.

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,460
 If I hadn't thought of Po Eun as the first Prime Minister to start with, 

36
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,900
 then I might not have been able to even materialize this new system. 

37
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,450
 Please... Please accept my thoughts. 

38
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:48,090
 Sam Bong, why are you doing this to me? Just why me? 

39
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,570
 You can just do it yourself. 

40
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,300
 Don't you already know? 

41
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,590
 I... 

42
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,280
 I have already used too much military power and too many tricks. 

43
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,640
 I have too many faults to be considered a Confucian scholar. 

44
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,180
 So in the perfect country of Sadaebu that you planned, 

45
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,010
 you want me to be the last flawless stone. 

46
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,030
 It's indeed a sweet offer. 

47
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,090
Teacher, we caught her.

48
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,770
- Caught?
- Cho Young is Nameless' Ji Cheon Tae.

49
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,010
So, it really was like that?

50
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:50,040
She knew about your meeting with Teacher Po Eun so we arrested her when she went to Jangyeonggak.

51
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,800
Right. You did well.

52
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,340
Did you have a good talk with Teacher Po Eun?

53
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,120
I spoke with all my sincerity so let's wait.

54
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,820
Where is Cho Young?

55
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,440
Knowing that it's dangerous to leave Cho Young to the Investigation Bureau, General Nam Eun took her to interrogate separately.

56
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,480
We don't know how big an organization Nameless is, but this means that they lost Hwa Sa Dan.

57
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,030
This will also do great damage to them. You really did well.

58
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,260
Thank you.

59
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,920
Whether it's something related to Cho Young or Nameless, you will be in charge of it from here on.

60
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,730
With your resourcefulness, everything can be achieved.

61
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,440
Yes. I understand.

62
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
I will make sure to get it done.

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,970
Thank you.

64
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,260
We got tricked by Lee Bang Won?

65
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,170
He heard about Cho Young being our member and arrested her.

66
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,190
Were we really had by that kid, Lee Bang Won?

67
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,520
Did they go to the Investigation Bureau?

68
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,720
No. It seems that they secretly moved her to a separate place.

69
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,140
In a time like this, when Baek Geun Soo has died and it's difficult for us to watch over the king, to think that Cho Young was taken...

70
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,940
Your priority is to find Cho Young's whereabouts.

71
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,090
This is not a simple matter. Report it.

72
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,710
Just wait a bit.

73
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,510
Ji Cheon Tae being exposed is the same as losing half of our information

74
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,070
because of your mistake!

75
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,710
Cho Young has to be in Hwa Sa Dan for us to move the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok and the Sadaebu, hence moving the king as well.

76
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,480
It has now become difficult to move the king.

77
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,870
Is it just that?

78
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,390
Even though we found out Jeong Mong Joo's thoughts, we still need more steps.

79
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,190
How would I not know the problems that it causes?

80
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,960
How about finding a different sword? I don't think Jeong Mong Joo will do.

81
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm already deliberating on that so just wait.

82
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,360
Do you admit that you are a Nameless?

83
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,580
Was it Lee Bang Won?

84
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,170
Then the Maengdo Chilyak that Lee Bang Won was talking about...

85
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,160
It didn't mean anything.

86
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,660
There was indeed a reason that Lee In Gyeom and Hong In Bang paid special attention.

87
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,820
That young man is amazing.

88
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,950
Have you given him lots of compliments? I think you should.

89
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,910
He's probably in a foul mood right now.

90
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,100
What do you mean by that?

91
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,450
 New Joseon 

92
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,940
 Who are you? 

93
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,400
 I waited for a long time. 

94
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,240
 For me? 

95
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,080
 You don't have a place here. 

96
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,620
What happened?

97
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,880
Did Cho Young talk?

98
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
No. She just said strange things.

99
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,300
Strange things?

100
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,040
She said she will only tell Bang Won.

101
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,370
Just to me?

102
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,640
Wow. The moment that you caught Hwa Sa Dan's Owner, Cho Young, I confirmed it again.

103
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,910
I chose the right man! Didn't you say so at Do Hwa Jeon last time?

104
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,850
That you wanted to practice politics that will protect our dreams.

105
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,600
I think you can really practice that kind of politics.

106
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
No, I don't just think that you can. Just do it. Do it! I'm really sure of it.

107
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,330
 It's my first time seeing people gathered like that and smiling. 

108
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,420
 You were the one who made that happen. 

109
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,020
Young Master, what's wrong?

110
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,100
That dream.

111
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,140
Do you know when I started dreaming of it?

112
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,300
- What?
- The day when Gil Tae Mi died. It started on that day.

113
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,550
It was on that day when I was acknowledged by you.

114
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,090
Because of me?

115
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,450
Actually, at that moment, in my heart,

116
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,150
I was very proud.

117
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,000
You said so,

118
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,130
that it was your first time seeing people smile like that,

119
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,220
that you knew that I was the one who made it happen.

120
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,790
Those words made me so happy,

121
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,500
I thought I was going to die.

122
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,540
Politics that will make people happy and smile.

123
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,980
That became my dream from that moment on.

124
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,520
Then, what's wrong?

125
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,260
You can just do it. It will happen if you do it.

126
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,140
I'm just saying.

127
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,650
I heard you wanted to see me.

128
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,080
Yes.

129
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,370
 If Jeong Mong Joo doesn't move according to our plans, we have to find a new sword. 

130
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,280
 Like that time with King Gong Min, 

131
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,210
 a useful sword like Hong Ryun. 

132
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,140
 I need to bet on this fight. 

133
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,400
Please send your bodyguard out.

134
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,950
Please send the soldiers outside farther.

135
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,440
Send the bodyguard out? Why?

136
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,500
What kind of trick can I do here?

137
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,220
I just want to appease your curiosity.

138
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,950
Go out for a while and take the soldiers a little farther away.

139
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,430
Yes.

140
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
While thinking about it, it seemed quite strange.

141
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,460
Why didn't General Nam Eun ask me

142
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,330
about what I heard at Jangyeonggak?

143
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,360
He was supposed to confirm that.

144
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,710
It's probably because you didn't say anything.

145
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,470
What do you want to say?

146
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,520
I heard the beginning of what Sam Bong and Po Eun were talking about.

147
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,000
You probably heard the other half.

148
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,400
What about exchanging information?

149
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
Why?

150
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,450
I can just ask Teacher.

151
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,310
So why do I have to exchange that with you?

152
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,660
General Lee Seong Gye

153
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,010
will be kept in a prison called King.

154
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,170
General Lee Seong Gye's family will be imprisoned there with him.

155
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,820
It's not a country ruled by the king

156
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,770
but a country ruled by a prime minster that

157
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,490
oversees the law, the system and the ordinance.

158
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,180
 General Lee Seong Gye will be kept in a prison called King. 

159
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,630
 Sam Bong, you have thought of something big. 

160
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,760
 Someone said that turbulent times are hell for the weak.  

161
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,690
 Because during turbulent times, the desires of the strong rise without limits. 

162
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,230
 If so, what are peaceful times?  

163
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,640
 It's hell for the strong. 

164
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,700
 Locking up all the strong ones. 

165
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,060
 A world where the weak can live safely and at the least enjoy some abundance. 

166
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,360
 Isn't that what peaceful times is all about? 

167
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,950
 What are we going to use to lock up the strong people? 

168
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,320
 With law, system, ordinance, and those checking on each other.   

169
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,120
 The most important system to raise a new country 

170
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,370
 is to have the strongest king and royal family 

171
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,240
 kept in the most secure prison.  

172
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,930
 A secure prison... 

173
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,440
The king and the royal family

174
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,110
will be placed in a secure prison.

175
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,600
The next part is probably no different from what I heard.

176
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,000
They are people that saw even the great King Gong Min

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,450
collapse due to self-righteousness.

178
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,850
Instead of entrusting the country to a sole king,

179
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,780
entrusting it to the law, the system, and the ordinance

180
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,960
is an obvious and right choice.

181
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,360
Still, you don't like it, right?

182
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,980
No matter how good the country is,

183
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,550
if it's a country where you can't do anything, then there's no way you'd like it.

184
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,040
Also, there's no saying that the chosen Prime Minister

185
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,140
will actually do well.

186
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,440
Sadaebu has always made fools out of people.

187
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,950
Our Nameless is not against establishing a new country.

188
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,540
We are thinking of supporting General Lee Seong Gye as king.

189
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,280
This is a fact.

190
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,600
We tried to attack Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi as well,

191
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,410
and tried to stop Choi Yeong's reckless war.

192
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,430
We are on the same side.

193
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,150
Except for one thing.

194
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,300
What is it?

195
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,310
Land reform.

196
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:32,080
So you were actually a bunch of petty people trying to protect their lands...

197
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,080
I thought Nameless had some sort of great cause.

198
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,830
Nameless' great cause,

199
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,890
don't you want to know more about it?

200
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,890
Think about it.

201
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,730
We match well with you.

202
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,400
We don't like the land reform, and

203
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,210
you probably don't like the existence of a Prime Minister's total control.

204
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,440
Without those two,

205
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,270
a country can still be established.

206
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,540
Stop fooling around.

207
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:31,330


208
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,090
What did Cho Young say? Why did she want to see you?

209
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,080
Did she talk about Nameless? Perhaps...

210
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,750
Did you ask about my mom?

211
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,310
Nothing special came up?

212
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,280
Tell me.

213
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,310
I'm sorry. I need to sleep.

214
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,320
- Did something happen?
- I'm very tired.

215
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,290
 Now the only road left for you 

216
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,430
 is to hold my hand and get the power you've always wanted. 

217
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,910
 I already found a way. 

218
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,840
 You'll probably lose it again, like always.  

219
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,140
 In this place, in this room, 

220
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,730
 there's no place for you. 

221
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,600
 Do I really not have a place in that country?  

222
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,450
 Did I lose my way again? 

223
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,750
 Teacher. 

224
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,680
 In this new country, 

225
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,930
 please become the first prime minister. 

226
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,470
 Thank you, Sam Bong. 

227
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,760
 Now, I understand that persuading you is impossible. 

228
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,790
 After planning that perfect country, how can you give it up? 

229
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,930
 I will make it so that you don't give up. 

230
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:00,190
 However, I won't be that new country's first prime minister, 

231
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,970
 but I will be this Goryeo's last subject. 

232
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,710
 If the heaven's haven't abandoned Goryeo, then I should be able to protect it from you 

233
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:22,170
 If this country's luck is all used up, as a Confucian scholar, I will have my end with my country.  

234
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,440
 Before I die, Goryeo will not end. 

235
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,300
Right. What is it that caused you to come in so late at night?

236
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,440
I have something urgent to talk to you about regarding the land reform.

237
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,360
We won't be able to do the land reform like this.

238
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,100
The land survey is underway so what are you saying?

239
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,230
There are reports saying that things aren't going well.

240
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,280
Even if an official from the Central Office goes, in the end the help from the local offices

241
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,060
is desperately needed.

242
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,180
Yes. But the majority of them are people that received support from the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

243
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,670
So they are always trying to interfere instead of helping.

244
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,350
Interfering? How can they do this without looking down at us?

245
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,110
Why do you think so?

246
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:32,660
Since Lord Lee Saek is still sitting in Do Dang, they have someone to put their trust in.

247
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,380
Lord Lee Saek needs to be impeached.

248
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,150
But one of Po Eun's conditions was to be allied with Lord Lee Saek.

249
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,910
Without Po Eun's agreement, we can't do that.

250
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,420
We have to do the land reform? How come that even you are being like this?

251
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,910
How can we still call it Goryeo if we destroy the government laws that have been passed down for hundreds of years?

252
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:09,940
If you don't do the land reform, Your Highness will not be able to protect this country.

253
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,010
How can we collect taxes when there are no people with land?

254
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,140
The state treasury has already hit bottom.

255
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,190
At this rate, we can't protect Goryeo from those people.

256
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,740
By those people, do you mean General Lee Seong Gye and Sam Bong?

257
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,750
It's not General Lee Seong Gye but Sam Bong.

258
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,540
If you make Lee Seong Gye into an enemy, then in the current situation, there is no way we can protect the country.

259
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,640
How are we going to deal with his massive military power?

260
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,500
Then,

261
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,100
you are going to separate the two?

262
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:56,410
Please wait. I will separate the two and attack Sam Bong.

263
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,960
Your Highness should approve the land reform and gain the people's sentiments.

264
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,490
Those people will surely impeach Lord Lee Saek.

265
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,840
Yes. They probably will. That's what will happen.

266
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,730
No, you have to.

267
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,060
Po Eun!

268
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,310
If I act against them right now, then it's hard to see what will happen to me.

269
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:27,590
So I will survive this time and find a next opportunity.

270
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,800
Your Majesty. Please understand.

271
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,060
I understand.

272
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,750
Yoon Rang, come closer.

273
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,310
Yes.

274
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,310
If something were to happen to Po Eun, then there will be no more option for me.

275
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:58,200
So, from now on, think of Po Eun as me and protect him.

276
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,870
But, Your Highness.

277
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,620
Those people don't have a reason to kill me.

278
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,560
If they did, they wouldn't put me on the throne.

279
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,020
Your Highness, your grace is immeasurable.

280
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,060
Those people are probably watching so from now on all communication

281
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,180
will be sent through this woman.

282
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,760
 Cheok Sa Gwang 

283
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,400
Are you really going to do that, Po Eun?

284
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,760
Yes.

285
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,330
The land reform must be approved.

286
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,390
I will support you with what little I have.

287
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:46,900
I heard that it will be hard to proceed without Lee Saek's impeachment.

288
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,060
I know.

289
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,850
Do that.

290
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,470
Are you serious? Will you join our cause?

291
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,120
Thank you, Po Eun.

292
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,370
Thank you so much.

293
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,730
Why are you being like this? I haven't decided yet to  completely follow your plan.

294
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,970
Yes. Take all the time you need to think about it.

295
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:22,090
The more I think about it, your plans are really great.

296
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,310
As another Confucian scholar, I think I almost feel inferior.

297
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,250
Why are you like this?

298
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,880
However, please wait for my answer.

299
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,460
Yes. Of course.

300
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,800
Of course!

301
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,610
Here.

302
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,410
 I'm sorry, Sam Bong. 

303
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:55,250
 For this collapsing country, I needed to fool the world and you  

304
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,060
 since you will not be able to give it up... 

305
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,590
 Lee Bang Ji 

306
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,990
 What is this feeling? 

307
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,060
Take care, Po Eun.

308
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,570
Right. I'll see you tomorrow.

309
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,790
Let's go.

310
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,180
Husband, are you okay?

311
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,100
What do you mean?

312
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,280
You look very unwell.

313
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,990
It's nothing now.

314
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,090
But why are you wearing a topknot all of a sudden?

315
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,720
It was actually more weird that I hadn't all this time.

316
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,730
His Majesty has accepted Lord Lee Saek's impeachment.

317
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,290
Is that so?

318
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,700
Then, was there an order from the Investigation Bureau to arrest him?

319
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,200
Yes. I will deliver the royal command.

320
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
 Teacher! This is Bang Won. 

321
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,830
Come in. You can go out now.

322
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,790
Yes!

323
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,590
Are you wearing a topknot?

324
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,870
Yes.

325
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,190
Right. What happened to Cho Young?

326
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,860
If we are to eradicate the Nameless, I think we'll have to go at it a different way.

327
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,620
A different way?

328
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,410
I will try to be bait and see.

329
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,490
Bait?

330
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,490
Cho Young is trying to win me over.

331
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,480
Win you over?

332
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,080
She said the equal land division will never come true.

333
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,910
Saying that not only will it never work, but also cause many sacrifices along the way.

334
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,280
So?

335
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:23,120
She said that if I help stop the land reform, then they will help me with anything.

336
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,170
They say that they will be my strength.

337
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:32,270
It's like what Nameless will do. They are trying to make you turn against us like they did with Po Eun.

338
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,270
As expected. Hwa Sa Dan also knows about the trouble you made before.

339
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,400
Yes. So I'm thinking of going over to their side.

340
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,080
What about pretending that I'm wavering and then tricking them?

341
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,410
How?

342
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:55,900
I'll pretend to be won over by Cho Young's suggestion and look like I'm having other thoughts.

343
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,070
Then they are going to contact me.

344
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,950
Having different thoughts?

345
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,820
First of all, I'm thinking of training soldiers separately.

346
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,890
Don't you think they will believe me then?

347
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:20,460
Yes. Try that. Nameless is an organization that's hard to understand even if we capture one of the members.

348
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,500
I wish for your plan to succeed.

349
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Yes, Teacher.

350
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,070
You look good in a topknot.

351
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,740
Yes.

352
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,450
 Because I'm not a child anymore. 

353
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,290
I think it's a good plan. As expected, our Young Master is smart.

354
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,800
Teacher! Teacher! Jo Joon finally sent an impeachment--

355
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,300
Lee Saek and Ha Ryun, receive His Majesty's decree.

356
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,270
Just what is my crime?

357
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:09,010
With Jo Min Soo, you enthroned Wang Chang, who is not of the king's bloodline,

358
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,590
and gathered up Lee In Gyeom's followers to disturb the country.

359
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,830
Did you know about the matter with Teacher Lee Saek?

360
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,630
Teacher Lee Saek will have to face the consequences of his mistakes.

361
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,420
And this is inevitable for the land reform.

362
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,390
Even so.

363
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:37,350
Didn't you guys also say it as well? That the land survey is difficult due to the interference of Gwon Moon Sae Jok that's sided with Teacher Lee Saek.

364
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,280
That is indeed true, but...

365
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,140
Secretly relay this to all the people who follow me.

366
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,000
Until the land reform is done, we'll lie low,

367
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,140
but during that time we'll have to take control of all the government positions related to remonstrating the king.

368
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,960
Act carefully and discreetly so as not to arouse suspicion by Lee Seong Gye's group.

369
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
Yes.

370
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,280
Ten or so people, including Lee Saek and Ha Ryun, have been impeached and arrested.

371
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,820
What about Po Eun?

372
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:16,400
He didn't do anything.

373
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,800
It's now confirmed.

374
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,240
We failed with Jeong Mong Joo.

375
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,270
Now they will proceed with the land reform as quick as possible.

376
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,410
Let's report this to that person.

377
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,310
That person is coming here anyway.

378
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,680
That person is coming here?

379
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,990
Then, am I finally going to see that person's face as well?

380
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,760
Monk, this is Nam Cheon.

381
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,680
Monk, we found Cho Young's location.

382
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,090
On the West outskirts, near the Ongnyo Temple.

383
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,420
How many soldiers were there?

384
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,280
I think they were trying to avoid been seen, so it's less than ten or so.

385
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,170
We'll go take them out and rescue Cho Young.

386
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,360
I will go myself.

387
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:14,220


388
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,370
Who are those people?

389
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,990
Just what is...

390
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,660
Have a seat. It's cold.

391
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,890
What are you doing?

392
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:38,010
What do you think? It's my answer to your question.

393
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,140
- Then...?
- Do you know what Sal Saeng Mok is?

394
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,390
If you want to kill someone or win against them, plant their names as trees.

395
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,800
When I was young, I planted them.

396
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,030
The first one that I planted was Lee In Gyeom.

397
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,610
Why Hap Ha?

398
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:08,450
He stole Father's power and opportunity.

399
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,860
The second one was Hong In Bang.

400
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,990
I know that you have a lot of stories with Hong In Bang.

401
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:24,640
Among those, there is only one important thing.

402
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:35,170
He made me powerless and told me to join hands with him.

403
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:45,940
I'm saying this for the first time. I almost got caught.

404
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,950
I lost my way and wandered for a long time.

405
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,020
If I had grabbed onto his hand, I would've led a different life.

406
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:07,830
However, what came to me at that time

407
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,830
was Sam Bong, that person.

408
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:15,170
You found your way.

409
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,290
I did.

410
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,870
Even just thinking of participating in that person's great cause made my heart feel like it was going to explode.

411
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,940
Getting rid of this rotten Goryeo

412
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:36,210
and establishing a new country where the people can enjoy life.

413
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:47,930
But he said that I don't have a place in that country.

414
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:56,940
I realized that I don't have anything I can do in that country.

415
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:04,330
No, from the beginning, in that person's great cause,

416
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:11,660
I now know that there was no such thing as a place for me.

417
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,700
It's enough reason for you to accept my offer. I understand.

418
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:30,350
You people took Hong Ryun to kill King Gong Min and raised Lee In Gyeom to that position.

419
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,270
Just remember this one thing.

420
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,940
I am not Hong Ryun.

421
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,660
If you're thinking of using me like Hong Ryun,

422
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:56,390
that will really be the worst mistake in the whole existence of Nameless.

423
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,350
I will keep it in mind.

424
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,200
Go.

425
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,860
I will go and relay your will.

426
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,930
About the five Rules...

427
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,680
By any chance, do you know a woman called Yeon Hyang?

428
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,460
I heard that she was captured by Nameless a long time ago.

429
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,210
What about returning Yeon Hyang as a proof of our alliance?

430
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,040
How did you know Yeon Hyang?

431
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:02,350
So you do know her. Her children are looking for her.

432
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,760
I put my trust in you.

433
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,880
 Yeon Hyang's children are alive? 

434
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,460
Master.

435
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,310
Are you okay?

436
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:42,210
Yes. I was unexpectedly thrown into a troubling situtaion,

437
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,070
but unexpectedly there was also a profit.

438
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,420
Lee Bang Won. Lee Seong Gye's fifth son.

439
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,310
What about using him as our new sword?

440
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,340
Back then, you were talking with such redness in your face that I was almost fooled.

441
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,210
Who would think that it was just all planned? Right?

442
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:15,150
That's what I'm saying. I've seen Young Master lie so many times but today was the best!

443
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,440
Looking at it earlier, Cho Young also got tricked, right?

444
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,020
Yeah!

445
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:24,090
Young Master, how can you say such things as if you're being sincere?

446
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,500
I thought it was true. I almost got fooled.

447
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,310
 The more I spoke, the more I became sincere. 

448
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:38,140
As expected, you weren't called Ji Cheon Tae for nothing. Even in a critical situation, you made a good opportunity.

449
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,250
Yes.

450
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,880
As soon as I return, I will explain--

451
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,440
But...

452
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,040
I'm thinking that you shouldn't have talked about Yeon Hyang.

453
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,430
Did you hear everything?

454
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,770
I heard and saw everything.

455
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:06,030
Then, I'm going to ask you.

456
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:12,620
How is it that those children are still alive?

457
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,270
What were those corpses that you brought before?

458
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,410
There were a lot of corpses of little children in this country.

459
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:31,290
I just took unrecognizable corpses of a boy and a girl.

460
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,270
How can you do such a thing...

461
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:39,820
There was no reason to it. I just couldn't find them.

462
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,720
In any case, if this becomes known we don't know what will happen.

463
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,160
Perhaps, like in 1378, there could be an internal war.

464
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,880
Let's keep our mouths shut, Ji Cheon Tae.

465
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,940
Until when are you going to keep this a secret?

466
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,750
The children are alive and they're even looking for her.

467
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,390
How did this happen? Cho Young disappeared.

468
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,560
Yes. The warriors who were guarding Cho Young had all collapsed and there was no one in the storage.

469
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,210
No matter how I look at it, it's definitely Nameless.

470
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,080
It's a trap made by us.

471
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,180
It's Bang Won's plan. It has to be done secretly, so make sure not to tell anyone.

472
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,360
Also, starting tomorrow, Bang Won will do something to deceive them.

473
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,220
So, Boon Yi, just do as Bang Won tells you to.

474
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,780
Yes. I understand.

475
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,820
That's everything.

476
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,630
Did you not see any trace of lies?

477
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,270
No.

478
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,590
Don't worry.

479
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:57,730
In order to make Hwa Sa Dan, how much money, time and people were invested

480
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,480
you probably know best.

481
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,380
But it's not just that the organization was destroyed.

482
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,940
They went over to Jung Do Jeon's side. How are you going to take responsibility for this?

483
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,650
I will follow that person.

484
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,590
You won't even be able to pay for it with your life. What are you going to do?

485
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,300
Will you at least commit suicide?

486
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,070
I am Ji Cheon Tae.

487
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:32,820
If there's an order for it, I will definitely do so but the only one who can tell me to kill myself is that person.

488
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,390
That is right.

489
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:47,830
Also, because you brought in Lee Bang Won, wait for that person's judgement.

490
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,580
Yes.

491
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,750
Overseer of all the government positions...

492
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,160
It seems that Jeong Mong Joo has joined that side.

493
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,360
Did this person, Jeong Do Jeon, really

494
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,390
create a perfect Confucianist country?

495
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,370
This could be more dangerous than the land reform.

496
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,890
What are we going to do?

497
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,210
Lee Bang Won.

498
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,430
In order to see whether he is the right man for our new sword,

499
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,950
let's watch over him a bit more.

500
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:25,850
From now on, watch closely over Lee Bang Won.

501
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,270
Yes. I understand.

502
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,570
You're moving out?

503
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,390
Yes.

504
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,560
Well, it's about time for you to do so.

505
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,650
You do look like an adult now.

506
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,110
 Does Father know? 

507
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,270
I heard that you have achieved something big this time.

508
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,360
Lady Yeon Hee has given me a lot of help.

509
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,000
Sam Bong told me that your problem solving and wisdom are excellent.

510
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,160
He told me that you will be in charge of big things in the future.

511
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,480
I heard that you're working on catching Nameless this time.

512
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,220
 What kind of country the new country is going to be, what kind of position being a king is. 

513
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:15,240
 Does he know what will happen to the royals (in the new country)? 

514
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,060
However,

515
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,620
don't work while expecting something in return.

516
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:28,100
That will also be the same after achieving our great cause.

517
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,370
How come you're not answering?

518
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,760
There's no way that would happen.

519
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,200
What else would I want?

520
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,920
I've emptied the Gyeong Duk Jeon.

521
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,710
Yes, father. I am moved to tears for your generosity.

522
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,900
However, why are you moving out all of a sudden?

523
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,670
It seems that something changed in my husband.

524
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,770
Isn't this a good thing?

525
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,970
He'll be here soon so you can personally ask him.

526
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,150
Your husband is here.

527
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,620
Father-in-law, are you doing well?

528
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,630
I heard from Da Kyeong.

529
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,330
You can just move into Gyeong Duk Jeon right away.

530
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,990
Yes.

531
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:27,260
Before I give you my thanks,

532
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,300
I want to ask for a difficult favor.

533
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,370
What is it?

534
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,250
I need to take soldiers with me.

535
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:44,930
Not Ga Byeol Cho but my own soldiers.

536
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,430
Are you going to help me?

537
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,690
 Gyeong Deok Jeon 

538
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:11,270


539
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,070
This house is great!

540
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,590
It's a lot better than Ga Byeol Cho!

541
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,100
Aigoo.

542
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,770
How can you be so lazy? Just hurry and move the stuff.

543
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,430
Okay, I get it.

544
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,580
But why is he moving out all of a sudden?

545
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,070
It's about time for him to be independent.

546
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,450
Moo Hyul and Master Hong, follow me.

547
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,730
M-Master?

548
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,290
Master? Master Hong?

549
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,600
Yes! Master Hong. I am a Master!

550
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,560
Yes!

551
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,370
Boon, can you come see me for a bit?

552
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,380
Stop!

553
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,310
This is the first round of soldiers that were recruited.

554
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,350
They're not so good yet.

555
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,440
You.

556
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,680
Train them.

557
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,410
Not me?

558
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:55,900
Are you talking about me?

559
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,700
More soldiers will come in the future.

560
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,250
Please make them like Moo Hyul. A hundred more Moo Hyuls.

561
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,590
Do you understand?

562
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:14,730
Ah, yes... It'll be hard to make them into Moo Hyul, but...

563
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,790
Young Master!

564
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:30,870
I knew that the day would come when you would acknowledge me like this.

565
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:35,590
- Please don't kneel like this in front of your students.
- Yes.

566
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,520
Gently, gently.

567
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,390
What?

568
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,900
The funds for operating the marketplace messenger network will be provided by the Min family.

569
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,800
They will be given more abundantly than what was given by the  Ga Byeol Cho.

570
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,310
Managing it will be your responsibility.

571
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,620
I am moved to tears for your generosity, but why so suddenly?

572
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:13,130
Didn't you know that my husband is planning on tricking Nameless?

573
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,220
Yes. I heard about it.

574
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:22,020
So don't take orders directly from Elder Sam Bong, but take Husband's orders.

575
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,010
Yes.

576
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,750
Also.

577
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,290
Take these.

578
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,820
What are these?

579
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,540
You have read a lot of the things that Sam Bong has written, right?

580
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,900
I have but it's not like I read and understood all of them.

581
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,250
Yes that probably is so.

582
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,880
Read these books.

583
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:52,560
From here on, we have to put together all our strength for my husband.

584
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,120
Yes.

585
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:59,310
He moved out and assembled soldiers?

586
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,450
It's not strange for his age.

587
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,420
Among the siblings, it was only Lee Bang Won who didn't have his own soldiers so this is actually quite late.

588
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:14,050
I think what Cho Young said was right. Don't you think that Lee Bang Won is having different thoughts?

589
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,840
That person also thinks that way.

590
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,350
Ah! You scared me!

591
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:34,660
I haven't done anything yet so how come you're screaming already?

592
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:40,280
I mean, I already told you everything I know. So why are you heating up that metal?

593
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,280
I told you everything without missing one.

594
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,910
I told you everything that happened when we enthroned Wang Chang. And I already asked for forgiveness.

595
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,830
Please put down that beating stick!

596
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,120
Ah, you're too loud.

597
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,500
Please save me, please.

598
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,400
What's the matter?

599
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,830
I want to have a talk with this person. I'd be grateful if you would leave us be, Hyung-nim.

600
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,860
Go ahead.

601
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,860
Let's go out.

602
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,960
Did you find out?

603
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,920
About Nameless.

604
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,720
Did you find it? Did you catch them?

605
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,330
Who is Ji Cheon Tae? Cho Young?

606
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,580
Or was it Jeok Ryeong?

607
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:48,510
You will be sent into exile

608
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:55,000
along with Teacher Lee Saek and many Sadaebu that enthroned the false king.

609
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,050
Ah, that will probably happen.

610
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:05,810
I don't know how my life could be so shitty. I was exiled while staying around Jang Pyeong Gate.

611
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:13,410
Also exiled after opposing the Liadong conquest. And this time I ambitiously helped enthrone a king.

612
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,210
Who would've thought that king would be so useless.

613
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,100
Make sure to survive again this time.

614
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,510
I will be waiting.

615
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,830
And if I come back?

616
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,440
I will take you in.

617
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,230
You told me to find one. A person to take in.

618
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,180
What are you going to do after taking me in?

619
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,100
I will attack two enemies.

620
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,710
Two enemies?

621
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,320
One is Nameless.

622
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,570
I will shatter them to pieces. They offer no benefit to the world.

623
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,650
What about the other one?

624
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,450
I'm not decided yet so let's talk again when you come back.

625
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:12,080
But look here. I don't serve someone who serves another. Don't you serve someone?

626
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,110
Or are you not like that now?

627
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:28,330
If that is so, then until I return lay low.

628
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:32,890
Until you gain power, don't do anything.

629
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,430
You know what hiding your true self to your enemies is, right?

630
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:44,200
For right now, you must act polite and quiet as if you're dead, no matter what.

631
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,350
Everything about your physiognomy is good, but

632
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:57,880
you are too quick to act. If being hasty is met with power, it turns into taking initiative. But if it meets with desire,

633
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,110
it's death.

634
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,560
Unni!

635
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,170
Yes?

636
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:24,020
Young Master Bang Won told you to come to the cave. He said you'll understand what it means.

637
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,200
Young Master Bang Won?

638
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,540
Hey! Where are you? Stop playing around.

639
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,820
Hurry and come out instead of playing around.

640
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,250
Don't do it.

641
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,940
I said don't do it. Stop!

642
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,830
You!

643
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,970
Hey!

644
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,600
I said stop!

645
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,050
You!

646
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,760
You!

647
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,030
Be careful!

648
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,110
Come here!

649
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,150
Oh, wait!

650
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,170
There!

651
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,490
This...

652
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,360
Stop!

653
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,110
Why did you suddenly do it?

654
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,310
You haven't had many snowball fights, right?

655
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,470
I'm someone who had snowball fights back in the Western district.

656
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,710
But you...

657
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,540
Hey.

658
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,420
What's wrong?

659
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,860
Why are you being like that? Did something happen?

660
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:27,320
Boon.

661
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,400
Speak.

662
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,190
Now...

663
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,450
Now...

664
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,080
I'm done playing now.

665
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,130
I don't think I can

666
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,540
have fun with you like this anymore.

667
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:16,130


668
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,860
 Six Flying Dragons 

669
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,630
 Bang Won. Lee Bang Won. 

670
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,790
 Don't call my name from now on. 

671
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,550
 Are you Young Master Lee Bang Won? 

672
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,190
 What are the king's Five Rules? 

673
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,720
 I already told you! 

674
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,610
 Isn't it enough reason to not continue with Sam Bong?  

675
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,500
 We have to do the land survey again. 

676
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,760
 The land that will be divided among the people is not enough. 

677
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,350
 Are you telling us to delay the land reform? 

678
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:49,300
 Then, what happens to my promise with the people? 

679
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,160
 I, Jeong Do Jeon, will practice politics from now on. 

680
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,260
 This country's land will be reborn!
