1
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,460


2
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,170
That kind of instability and discord makes the world react,

3
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,900
and thus creates an opportunity for change.

4
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,220
And to Your Highness as well...

5
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,490
An opportunity will arise.

6
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:09,670
The one who's holding all the power, the one who's ruling above all,

7
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,140
an opportunity to make Sam Bong collapse.

8
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,890
If you do that, I will put my life on the line

9
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,360
to make Prince Ui An this country's foundation and protect him.

10
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,200
If we want to make Prince Ui Ahn, who is still very young, the Crown Prince,

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,690
and  raise the country's discipline and establish a foundation, it is necessary that you do that.

12
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,160
Why are you saying that?

13
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,160
There won't be a lot of confusion if Prince Yeong An ascends the throne as Crown Prince, but

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,280
if Prince Ui Ahn is chosen,

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,130
not only Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won), but Prince Hwae An (Lee Bang Gan) and Prince Young An (Lee Bang Gwa)

16
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,560
will definitely gather together to oppose it.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Will you give me authority?

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,170


19
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,360
I will do that.

20
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,190
Please protect Prince Ui An Bang Seok.

21
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,140
To create an opportunity for me,

22
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,920
you changed my father's mind?

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,010
Is that what you're saying?

24
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,220
Change?

25
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,890
We do not go against the general tide nor do we reverse it.

26
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,750
What is that about?

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,870
For example, Hong Ryun. If he had only been fully loyal to King Gong Min,

28
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,730
he probably wouldn't have fallen to our incitement.

29
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,530
If His Highness weren't already thinking of Prince Ui An, whatever scheming we do,

30
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,680
the Crown Prince would not have changed.

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,190
Father has already thought of him in the first place.

32
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,430
What is your prediction that if Bang Seok doesn't become king, he will die young about?

33
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,690
Whether it's a prediction or not, that is what will happen.

34
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,590
From here on, it's a war of life and death.

35
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,510
You are really interesting people.

36
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,020
I will take that as a compliment.

37
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:27,510
Didn't you say that you were established during Silla dynasty through a person called Yeom Jeong?

38
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,330
I heard that due to an internal conflict during the rebellion, Yeom Jong was killed by Bi Dam.

39
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,760
How's it the organization was able to continue on for 700 years?

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,930
After Yeo, Jeong died,

41
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,800
the remaining members went to Kim Chun Choo and dropped to their knees.
 (Kim Chun Choo: 29th King of Silla dynasty; King Taejong Muyeol) 

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,540
Kim Chun Choo, who was so close to achieving the unification of the three kingdoms, probably had a desire to acquire such a great intelligence organization.

43
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,140
But his son, Kim Beob Min tried to get rid of us all 
 (Kim Beob Min: 30th King of Silla dynasty;  King Mun Moo) 

44
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,010
so we went back into hiding in the darkness.

45
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,340
Why did you not fight?

46
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,070
We're you not strong enough to fight Kim Beop Min?

47
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,520
Didn't I tell you?

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,940
We don't defy the general tide. With the unification of the three kingdoms,

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:27,350
after he drove out the  opposing party, even without us, Kim Bum Min's reign was stable.

50
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,140
If there's stability, then we will quietly disappear again.

51
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:59,270
But Your Highness, are you really going to join hands with Nameless?

52
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,910
Why?

53
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,740
We are enemies.

54
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,910
Don't mind him. He's recently gotten a disease.

55
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,810
What disease?

56
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,750
Judging what is right and wrong. That disease.

57
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,980
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,420
If Nameless gets the same disease as you and asks like that,

59
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,140
what do you think the leader would say?

60
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,690
I'm not sure.

61
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,450
I will not let go of that hand until I need it.

62
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,290
Follow her!

63
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,270
Did Lord Sam Bong order you or was it Lady Yeon Hee?

64
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,810
What did you see and hear?

65
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,050
I didn't hear anything.

66
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,490
Then what should I do?

67
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,150
I was going to kill you if you heard.

68
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,920
I can't just believe your words as well.

69
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,210
Right. I can just do this.

70
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,770
To make an alliance with Nameless, I went to Bi Guk Temple

71
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,040
and made contact with a person from their organization.

72
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,180
You heard that clearly, right?

73
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,630
Moo Hyul, kill her.

74
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,250
Your Highness.

75
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,570
What are you doing?

76
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,410
Do we really have to kill her?

77
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,960
Then what should we do?

78
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,410
Should we release her with just a, "Don't do that again. Be careful"?

79
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:28,070
If we do that, she will go straight to Hwa Sa Dan and spill everything to Sam Bong or Lady Yeon Hee,

80
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,930
saying that Prince Jeong An is allied with Nameless.

81
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,630
Is that better?

82
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,570
No. That's...

83
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,490
Okay. Think about it some more.

84
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:48,250
Resolve it according to what your judgement tells you to do.

85
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,440
Seriously, what are you doing?

86
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,370
Is this something to be conflicted about? You already killed a lot of people at Do Hwa Jeon.

87
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,000
- This is a different situation.
- What's the difference?

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,780
There's an enemy in front of you. If you kill her, you will live. If you don't, you're the one who'll be dead.

89
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,540
Are we going to die if I don't kill this person?

90
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,580
His Highness the Prince could be put in a worse situation than just our death.

91
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,130
Say that you killed her.

92
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,100
Prince Ui An, Lee Bang Seok,

93
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,970
will be the foundation of this country.

94
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,560
Prince Ui An?

95
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,850
Also Second Minister of State Affairs

96
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,830
Jeong Do Jeon, will be in charge of the crown prince's education.

97
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,740
 Lord Sam Bong will be the crown prince's teacher? 

98
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,160
Next is about the appointments for meritorious contributors.

99
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,260
Second Minister of State Affairs, Jeong Do Jeon, read my decree regarding the meritorious contributors in founding the country.

100
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,260
Chief MInister of State Affairs Jo Joon, Second Minister of State Affairs Jeong Do Jeon,

101
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:25,110
and Second Minister of State Affairs Lee Ji Ran have placed faith in me during the chaotic times of Goryeo politics,

102
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,070
and to this day they have maintained their fidelity.

103
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,870
Such contribution is worthy of praise.

104
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,180
What? This does not make sense.

105
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,480
Prince Ui An will be the Crown Prince and you knew about it?

106
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,650
Prince Ui Ahn is not even a firstborn son

107
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,790
and he hasn't even made any contributions.

108
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,030
Wife. Please lower your voice.

109
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,790
Are you not even angry?

110
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,150
- Is that true?
- Really?

111
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,920
Does this make sense?

112
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,120
Why are you being so loud?

113
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,900
Ah, yes.

114
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,640
About that... There was a poster stuck on the market wall.

115
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,660
A poster?

116
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,640
Yes.

117
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,670
But it seems like it was posted by mistake.

118
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,510
What was written in it that you're being like this?

119
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,670
Ah, um. It was about the meritorious contributors in the founding of the country.

120
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,300
So many people have gathered in front of it.

121
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:41,770


122
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,000
Why is it that your name and the names of the other princes are not listed?

123
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,980
This

124
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,180
is definitely an inappropriate measure.

125
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,740
Do you really think so?

126
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,200
If Your Highness's contributions don't cancel out your  mistakes,

127
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,060
then it goes the same for the opposite too.

128
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,770
Lord Sam Bong...

129
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,670
Never mind. Don't be too sad over it.

130
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,490
 Even Lee Shin Jeok has a different opinion regarding the Doomundong case. 

131
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,020
Captain of the Ga Byeol Cho, Choon Gi is hereby appointed as Second-in-Command of the National Army.

132
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,760
You will be protecting His Highness even after this.

133
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:15,080
Moo Hyul is appointed as Registrar of Military Armaments.

134
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,190
 Military armaments. 

135
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,340
Captain of the Ga Byeol Cho, Jo Young Gyu is selected as second place for meritorious contributions. Also

136
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:31,320
Jo Young Gyu is appointed as Third Rank Minister of Culture.

137
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,860
Pardon?

138
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,270
Lord Sam Bong became the Teacher of Crown Prince and

139
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,860
the Chief Commander of the National Army.

140
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,040
What did you say?

141
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,340
He completely has all the power.

142
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,360
Lord Sam Bong already has control over the legislature and personnel.

143
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,670
But now, even the military forces?

144
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,870
This country is now in Sam Bong's hands.

145
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,880
Just how many positions does he have?

146
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,730
I'm sorry.

147
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,400
Father-in-law, you weren't given merits

148
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,780
because of me.

149
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,960
Who cares about merits?

150
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm fine but I'm worried about you.

151
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,040
Did none of the people around me receive merits?

152
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,220
That's not the case.

153
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,870
Jo Young Gyu did get merits but...

154
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,020
Something is strange here.

155
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,540
It's the same with Prince Ui An becoming the Crown Prince,

156
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,300
and the strangest thing is that Young Master Bang Won wasn't on the list of meritorious awards.

157
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,490
And even though I spent all my life wielding a sword in Ga Byeol Cho I'm Third Rank Minister of Culture.

158
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,460
And you are Registrar of Military Armaments. Isn't it weird?

159
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,150
But... I'm still in a military branch.

160
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,950
Hey! Do you even know what you do in  the military armament office?

161
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,400
It's a place where you manage the weaponry.

162
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,160
Aigoo, this punk. Do you even know how to count?

163
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,820
Of course, I know how to count.

164
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,810
Count?

165
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,640
Aigoo. This...

166
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,200
No. This is strange. Really strange.

167
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,700
Boon Yi?

168
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,760
Yes, Elder. Boon Yi will now be sent back.

169
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
Why?

170
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,800
The marketplace communication organization has always been for monitoring the movements of Gaegyeong's public personalities

171
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,280
and to check on who is meeting who and who is going to which house.

172
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,900
Everything gets reported to Boon Yi every hour and she organizes it.

173
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,720
That's right. That's what they've been doing all this time.

174
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,100
The problem is all that information is now going to Prince Jeong An.

175
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,200
Also, it got bigger after the Min family funded it.

176
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,060
I've been thinking about that problem.

177
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,820
The members follow Boon Yi.

178
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,920
Boon Yi has a weapon that is not fit for her identity and status.

179
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,900
This is also not good for Boon Yi.

180
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,640
Did you call for me?

181
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,370
Are you going to reject a government post until the end?

182
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,800
How can I wear an official's uniform? Please turn it down.

183
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,520
But about Prince Jeong An not getting merits...

184
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,140
Now that Prince Ui An has become the Crown Prince,

185
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,500
Prince Jeong An has become a dangerous power.

186
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,860
For safety, Prince Jeong An needs to become weak.

187
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,190
What about Boon Yi?

188
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,670
Boon Yi is still working on Prince Jeong An's side.

189
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,280
What are you going to do with our Boon Yi?

190
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,990
We are also talking about that.

191
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,780
Do you really have to do it like this?

192
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,140
The new country has been established

193
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,960
so why do we have to do this to each other...

194
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,260
After establishing the country, in order to stabilize the country,

195
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,100
I said that there would be complicated things.

196
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,420
There would also be dangerous powerful people.

197
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Although I didn't know it would be Prince Jeong An.

198
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,740
What did Prince Jeong An do wrong?

199
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,980
Doing something wrong is not the problem,

200
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:36,320
but if Prince Jeong An is harboring different thoughts from His Highness and Elder Bon Won,

201
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,220
then he will really become an enemy to us.

202
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,320
Let's make Boon Yi go back.

203
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,000
Ddang Sae.

204
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,300
What about you?

205
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:59,580
This is only the beginning. I still have a lot to do.

206
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,360
It would be nice if you were here too.

207
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,930
I can't take it anymore!

208
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,710
It's my first time seeing official garments not suit a person!

209
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,800
Oh, Your Highness, have you seen someone like that before?

210
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,610
It's not the first time. I already saw one before.

211
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,890
Who was it?

212
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,690
Uncle Ji Ran.

213
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,110
Lee Ji Ran... Ji Ran...

214
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,410
Ah! Stop laughing now, please. It's awkward for me too.

215
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,550
Still,

216
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,400
don't I look better than Young Gyu Hyung-nim?

217
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,850
Aigoo.

218
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,870
Moo Hyul!

219
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,650
Moo Hyul!

220
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,610
Grandmother.

221
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,570
Aigoo. My goodness.

222
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,880
Grandmother!

223
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,890
Noonim! Noonim!

224
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,800
Aigoo, seriously.

225
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,900
Aigoo, my goodness.

226
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,490
Grandmother, don't cry.

227
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,800
Are you that happy?

228
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,990
Why would you cry on such a good day? Stop!

229
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,100
Master Hong. Thank you very much, Master Hong.

230
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,750
Aigoo. I get to see our Moo Hyul wearing official garments before I die.

231
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,650
My goodness. It's all because of you, Master Hong.

232
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,210
Aigoo. Thank you very much, Master Hong.

233
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,920
It's indeed thanks to me but stop crying.

234
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,680
Aigoo. I'm so proud. I'm so proud of our Moo Hyul.

235
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,700
 I sincerely want to protect you, Young Master. 

236
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,690
 I will protect you and in the times when you make the people smile, 

237
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,920
 I want to feel that it's worth it. 

238
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,860
 So please officially make me your bodyguard. 

239
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,750
 Moo Hyul, kill her. 

240
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,850
 Do we really have to kill her? 

241
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,230
She's the one who's in charge of Prince Jeong An.

242
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,860
She went out last night to follow Prince Jeong An

243
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,340
but because she didn't come back, we searched and someone made her into this.

244
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,490
It was Prince Jeong An.

245
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,770
What is this?

246
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,930
What is this?

247
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,820
There's a line in the middle of the character "Myeong" for name.

248
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,520
Myeong for name.

249
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,910
It's not a name.

250
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,840
No name.

251
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,310
Nameless?

252
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,920
Can you even laugh right now?

253
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,400
Does this make sense?

254
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,420
What?

255
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,070
It doesn't make sense that Prince Ui An became the Crown Prince,

256
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,840
and it also doesn't make sense that you weren't given any merits.

257
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,730
In this situation...

258
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,600
Yes, Your Highness.

259
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,170
The thing that makes least sense

260
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,550
is that you became Third Rank Minister of Culture.

261
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,850
Ah, seriously! Stop doing that!

262
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,770
It's indeed strange but

263
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,170
what will happen now?

264
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,320
Young Gyu

265
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,490
is appointed as Minister of Culture to separate him from me.

266
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,820
Moo Hyul will be in charge of weapons production

267
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,250
to remove his strength from me.

268
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,320
Excuse me.

269
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,190
Is it really over between Elder Sam Bong and us...

270
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,160
Last night, we were even followed by Hwa Sa Dan spies.

271
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,100
That side is already thinking of us as enemies.

272
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,920
Excuse me, Your Highness.

273
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,710
Prince Yeong An and Prince Hwae An are here.

274
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,030
Honestly, I wouldn't mind if either of you became the crown prince.

275
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,230
Hyung-nim, what do you mean?

276
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:00,030
If Bang Woon Hyung-nim doesn't want to do it, it's just right that the second son takes it.

277
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,720
That's right.

278
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,790
But to think that Bang Seok became the crown prince

279
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,810
is not easy for me to accept.

280
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,910
Even when you were young, you followed Father

281
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,320
and spent your life on the battlefield.

282
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,890
And when fighting against General Choi Young, it was you who charged through Soong In Gate.

283
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,030
But not even a meritorious contributor

284
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,550
let alone the crown prince?

285
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,090
That's why you can't be the crown prince.

286
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,160
What are you saying?

287
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,830
You have spilled too much blood.

288
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,890
Father and Lord Sam Bong

289
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,430
are probably looking for a crown prince

290
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,610
who is a fit for the new clean country.

291
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,150
What did you just say?

292
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,330
Are you saying that it will only work if Bang Seok becomes the crown prince

293
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,210
because we are dirty?!

294
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,210
Of course, it's not that.

295
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,580
Anyway, since the youngest has become the crown prince,

296
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,800
without a care for our opinions,

297
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,380
those people must think of us as threats.

298
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,320
That's why we should join forces even among ourselves.

299
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,400
The two of you are right.

300
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,040
Considering our late mother, I don't think this is right.

301
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
Did you want to see me?

302
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,690
The time has come faster than I expected.

303
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,330
What are you saying?

304
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,710
The time for you to make a choice.

305
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,520
Our spy who was following Prince Jeong An has died.

306
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,980
Your spies tailed Prince Jeong An.

307
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,700
But that spy left a dying message.

308
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,720
Nameless.

309
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,710
This means that she either saw or heard that Prince Jeong An

310
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,670
is allied with Nameless before she died.

311
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,090
Also, Prince Hwae An and Prince Yeong An are in Prince Jeong An's residence, right?

312
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,040
Lord Ha Ryun and Lord Min Je were there too.

313
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,510
Unni.

314
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,170
Are you even spying on Gyeongdeok Jeon now?

315
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,110
That's also what you do, Boon.

316
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,460
Unni, we have never tailed people like

317
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,320
Elder Sam Bong and Lord Nam Eun.

318
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,360
It would be different if Prince Yeong An became the crown prince

319
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,360
but His Highness and Lord Sam Bong

320
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,490
chose Prince Ui An as the crown prince.

321
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,280
That's what they have decided on.

322
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,610
What decision?

323
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,160
Prince Yeong An, Prince Ik An, Prince Hwae An, and Prince Jeong An.
 (Prince Ik An: Lee Bang Ui, Lee Seong Gye's 3rd son) 

324
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,400
The decision to take away all those princes' power.

325
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,950
Nobody other than His Highness and the crown prince

326
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,580
should have other desires.

327
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,380
Unni.

328
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,680
Prince Jeong An is someone who supported and wished for this great cause more than anyone else.

329
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,860
Also, he worked harder than anyone for that.

330
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,640
But then,

331
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,500
the person, who desperately wanted the new country to be established cannot do anything now.

332
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,120
For such a great person to not be able to do anything,

333
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,810
is that the right thing?

334
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,030
Why?

335
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,470
So you think about it from His Highness' perspective?

336
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,990
You are a common person.

337
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,760
You're just a common person.

338
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,400
Unni,

339
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,170
what do you want me to do?

340
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,140
Elder Sam Bong said that he will give you a part of the land

341
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,990
that he received from being a founding contributor.

342
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,000
So you

343
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,990
should go there.

344
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,080
What about our organization members?

345
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,880
None of the remaining people have lands.

346
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,470
They can come to Hwa Sa Dan

347
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,270
or we'll make them soldiers in the investigation bureau.

348
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,600
I will take responsibility for that.

349
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,020
It might even be better for those people.

350
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,260
So

351
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,200
you should go there, Boon Yi.

352
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,240
It would be nice if you would listen to me.

353
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,410
You should also think about it, but

354
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,860
it's dangerous if you hesitate at a time like this,

355
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,910
to you and to the people around you.

356
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,370
What about you and Brother?

357
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,590
I still have things to do.

358
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,530
You should now live for yourself and for your happiness.

359
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,440
Don't get used in political battles like this.

360
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,040
Brother.

361
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,360
What do you wish I would do?

362
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,000
I really don't know.

363
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,680
Ddang Sae.

364
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,450
Doing this among ourselves,

365
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,540
I don't know which one is for the people

366
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,790
and which one is for us.

367
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,850
Still, you will stay by Elder Sam Bong's side.

368
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,370
I will.

369
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,820
But...

370
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,210
It's a country that started by unwillingly spilling blood, but

371
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,250
having a crown prince who is not tainted by blood

372
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,250
is His Highness' desperate wish.

373
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,310
Yes. It's not like I didn't know about that.

374
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,040
So please don't be angry, Woo Jae.

375
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,620
What use is it whether I get angry or not?

376
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,490
It's just that

377
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,600
there are a lot of things that need to be drastically carried out.

378
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,130
Because you installed a inexperienced young crown prince,

379
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,360
I was just quite frustrated.

380
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,860
Things that need to be drastically carried out?

381
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,190
Are you just going to leave the Wang family like that?

382
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,710
Because of His Highess' mercy,

383
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,900
we didn't do anything to Goryeo's kings and royal families.

384
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,230
His Highness was worried about public opinion.

385
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,060
You know that public opinion can become worse because of them, right?

386
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,080
So?

387
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,900
The majority of people in Gaegyeong are those who gained benefits from Goryeo.

388
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,530
If His Highness shows even a bit of a gap,

389
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,350
those people will long for the throne right away.

390
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,720
Then, public opinion would be more disrupted.

391
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,400
So...

392
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,130
Should we kill all of them?

393
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,920
Isn't that what you were thinking from the start?

394
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,480
Then will you make a petition with me together?

395
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,580
Please take this.

396
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,900
Ma'am, thank you.

397
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,470
We'll enjoy the drink.

398
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,430
I gave it to the soldiers outside.

399
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,080
The sweet rice drink was good.

400
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,750
Have some more.

401
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,690
I already drank a lot.

402
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,770
Aren't you having a hard time?

403
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,330
To me, compared to what has happened recently

404
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,040
this place is like a paradise.

405
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,500
That's right.

406
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,810
You worked hard.

407
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm sorry.

408
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,370
Please don't say that again.

409
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,350
I am alive

410
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,750
and Your Highness is healthy.

411
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,580
The rice drink is sweet and the floor is warm

412
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,060
so what else would I wish for?

413
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,530
In the end, Prince Ui An became the crown prince.

414
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,030
Sam Bong will start his attack soon.

415
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,210
Prince Jeong An needs to endure this well.

416
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,370
That's for Prince Jeong An to do,

417
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,070
but don't you think that we should also be prepared to fight?

418
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,280
Yes. We have to reestablish the intelligence organization we lost and regain our composure.

419
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,710
How's it going with the Hwado Inn?

420
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,980
Right now, Yook San and Cho Young

421
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,550
have probably arrived at Kanggye.

422
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:26,760
 Mansang Merchants 

423
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,610
It surprises me when I think about it.

424
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,060
Mansang Merchants being part of our organization

425
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,560
is something I wouldn't even dream about.

426
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,610
With this place as a starting point,

427
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,620
we need to connect everything with Hwado Inn.

428
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,170
Replacing Hwa Sa Dan with this

429
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,950
is what Mugeuk wants.

430
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,990
Yes, Teacher.

431
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:56,510


432
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,490
Have you decided

433
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,650
which side you will chose?

434
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,080
Sam Bong

435
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,270
or me?

436
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,260
Your Highness.

437
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,090
Don't say it. Your voice makes me nervous.

438
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,580
Think about it a bit more.

439
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
It might sound rude, but

440
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,980
Your Highness has already

441
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,310
accomplished a lot in the process of establishing the country,

442
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,370
- so...
- Don't say it.

443
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,760
In the new country,

444
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,100
can't you just be a prince

445
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,410
and live comfortably?

446
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,590
What?

447
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,200
You.

448
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,470
Not even someone else, but you...

449
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,290
What did you say?

450
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,320
What did you tell me to do?

451
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,390
You said you are on my side

452
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,510
and that you will always be on my side, even slapping me on the face!

453
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,090
You're the one who said that I must at least do something if I'm alive.

454
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,230
But

455
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,180
you're telling me to live comfortably and not do anything?

456
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,430
Not even someone else but you, Boon Yi!

457
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,570
No.

458
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,690
Never mind.

459
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,590
I can't even take responsibility for your life,

460
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,830
so if you choose Sam Bong

461
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:59,060
you're putting a knife between us and I won't hesitate to kill you.

462
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,010
You know that, right?

463
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,640
Yes.

464
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,180
You are like that, Your Highness.

465
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,790
So choose.

466
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,050
I will kindly give you a chance to choose.

467
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,350
I hear that as you telling me that

468
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,940
if I don't choose you, you will kill me.

469
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,870
Please...

470
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,360
Don't you hear me asking you to please choose me?

471
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,720
Don't you hear me desperately saying that I need you?

472
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
Get married.

473
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,760
I'm telling you to take Boon Yi as your concubine.

474
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,260
That is a safe and sure way.

475
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,000
Madam.

476
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,010
Boon, didn't I tell you before?

477
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,570
I told you that we have to join forces for my husband.

478
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,910
Wife.

479
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,310
Let's talk about this somewhere else.

480
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,110
Husband.

481
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,750
Right now, more so than other times, it is important that we have a grasp on the movements of important figures.

482
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,230
But if Boon Yi leaves, this organization will be handed over to Sam Bong.

483
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,320
What will happen if it gets taken?

484
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,420
Are you going to be fooled by Sam Bong

485
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,070
while not knowing anything?

486
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,510
Boon.

487
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:46,250
He needs you and your organization.

488
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,820
Stay.

489
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,680
If you would allow me

490
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,650
more time...

491
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,020
Because I receive funds from here, until then,

492
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,520
I will do as I normally do.

493
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,540
Rise is 4, jerky is 3...

494
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,790
If we save up for a year...

495
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,380
Does he earn that much?

496
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,060
Why won't Bang Ji accept a government post?

497
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,690
I got confused because of you!

498
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,250
How much do I need to save to set up a tavern?

499
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,510
Moo Hyul is a government official so why do you need to set up a tavern?

500
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,690
As long as he stays with Prince Jeong An, he'll always have his government post.

501
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,520
No. I should at least have one tavern

502
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,200
and make Moo Hyul quit from here.

503
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,830
Why?

504
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,660
It's too dangerous.

505
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,010
It's already a dangerous job

506
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,550
but the higher people have started fighting these days.

507
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:21,340
Still, how can a man live while getting bored tending a tavern?

508
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,670
Getting bored? Why you are so childish.

509
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,310
Aigoo... What...

510
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,640
You too Boon Yi. If they give you some sort of reward, take it right away.

511
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,080
Hurry and leave here.

512
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,380
What about our members?

513
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,380
Those people would also decide on a good place.

514
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,310
You don't have to be responsible for that as well.

515
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,800
Honestly, they're not even family so how can you be responsible for them until the end?

516
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,540
I say that's not right at all.

517
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,310
Oh my! What was I thinking? Don't you think the fire was extinguished already?

518
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,110
Aigoo!

519
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,250
- You're so young yet you forget.
- Let's hurry up!

520
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,130
Aigoo. What to do? What to do?

521
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,470
 Abandoning people who are precious to you 

522
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,210
 and becoming enemies with the people you love, 

523
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,660
 if you don't have resolution to do that, then just quit. 

524
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,860
 Pretending to live for the world. 

525
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,030
 Don't do it if you're not confident. 

526
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,570
 Just 

527
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,550
 live thinking about yourself. 

528
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,280
 Don't look at the world. 

529
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,220
Are you just complaining?

530
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,690
Complaining? How can you say such a thing?

531
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,350
Right now, Lord Sam Bong has all the power in this country.

532
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,520
At a time like this, when you need all the help you can get,

533
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,450
I would give you even a hundred concubines!

534
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,710
It's a dangerous situation where we don't know

535
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,430
what kind of attack Sam Bong will launch your way tomorrow!

536
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,990
Are there really that many people

537
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,590
- who unfairly became slaves?
- Yes, Your Highness.

538
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,330
So please decide on their rights and wrongs

539
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:54,680
and change their status to normal.

540
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,960
Then Chief Minister of State Affairs

541
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,210
please be in charge of the slave problem and resolve it.

542
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:08,720
Your Highness, have you reviewed the agenda I raised to you?

543
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,960
Do you think that doing this now

544
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,600
is the right timing?

545
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,390
Yes. For the stability of national defense,

546
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,690
I think this is the most urgent case.

547
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,390
I understand. Then,

548
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:34,550
Jeong Do Jeon

549
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,620
will be the border affairs official

550
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,720
and I order him to go to the border.

551
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,310
Yes. I will accept your command.

552
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,070
I will correct the border boundaries

553
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:52,590
and I will be back after taking care of the national defense's administration district.

554
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,100
 As soon as he got the authority, he's going to the frontier... 

555
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,810
 What are you exactly planning, Sam Bong? 

556
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,310
Are you saying that Sam Bong is going to the North?

557
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:10,000
I knew that something will happen soon.

558
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,050
Couldn't it be that Father is trying to control Sam Bong?

559
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,020
No. Something feels strange.

560
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,620
At this time, the Northern region...

561
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,510
- Did you say Sam Bong?
- Yes.

562
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,470
He was placed in charge of border affairs and is now on his way to the border.

563
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,720
As soon as he got the authority in his hand,

564
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,500
he's going to the border.

565
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,020
Yes. It is very odd.

566
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,760
Go see Prince Jeong An.

567
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,580
You just blatantly come to find me now.

568
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:53,810
What's wrong? Everyone in Gaegyeong knows that I'm an information merchant.

569
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,160
Lord Sam Bong got Hwa Sa Dan

570
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,680
so isn't it just natural for you to acquire Bi Guk Temple?

571
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,020
That's right. Why did you come here?

572
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,330
There's only one reason.

573
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:12,050
What could Sam Bong be thinking?

574
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,100
What do you think, Prince Jeong An?

575
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,320
You're the merchant but did you come to me to buy information?

576
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,450
Let's think about it together.

577
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,660
That's what I'm saying.

578
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,770
We got a message from Mansang Merchants of Kanggye.

579
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,010
They have succeeded in organizing the meeting.

580
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,090
Alright, good work.

581
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,760
Who are you going to meet?

582
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,780
I'm going to meet a chief of the Yeojin tribe.

583
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,420
- Are you going to cross the border?
- That's right.

584
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,300
You did a great job in managing to arrange a meeting.

585
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,550
There is a Mansang merchant who dealt with Cho Young in Kanggye.

586
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,110
- Right.
- To that side,

587
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,040
I introduced you as the owner of Saryang Group of Haejoo.

588
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,250
Saryang Group?

589
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,520
Do you know Saryang Group?

590
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,710
It's a merchant group in Haejoo, but

591
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,620
I don't personally know them.

592
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,750
Hwa Sa Dan is now Jeong Do Jeon's property.

593
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,380
We also don't know what he's planning.

594
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:18,210
- Yes. We'd have to closely monitor Saryang Group's owner.
- Yes.

595
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,950
No. Introduce me.

596
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,570
I would know if I personally met him.

597
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,180
If you steal something from the marketplace again ,

598
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,000
you'll be chased out immediately.

599
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,130
I won't do it. You're overreacting.

600
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,820
Are you going to do it or not?

601
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,750
You have to endure it even if your hands feel itchy.

602
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,050
They don't feel itchy.

603
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,830
Oh, you've come?

604
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,030
Um, Ahjussi...

605
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,870
Even without me,

606
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,780
you can lead the others well, right?

607
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,100
Why did you suddenly ask such a thing?

608
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,330
When I leave,

609
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,070
I want you to take my position.

610
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,000
Where will you be going?

611
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,010
No. Just in case. In case.

612
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,650
Well... How do I say this...

613
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,010
There's nothing that I won't be able to do but

614
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,240
you still have to be here.

615
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,620
That's right. You have to be here.

616
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,480
But why are you bringing up something like that all of a sudden?

617
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,570
It's nothing. I will tell you later.

618
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,820
Please have some people follow Sam Bong.

619
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,700
The one who was spying Prince Jeong An was killed

620
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,890
and she left a dying message: Nameless.

621
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,870
Did Bang Won really...

622
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,550
It seems that reasons to attack Nameless keep growing.

623
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,840
Reading through history documents, 700 years ago, Yeom Jeong,

624
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,800
throughout the Three Kingdoms, the Sui dynasty and the Tang dyansty,

625
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,000
he set up group called Hwado Inn.

626
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,260
and an information organization called Heungmyeong Group.

627
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,230
Hwado? Hwado Inn?

628
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,630
Yes. It's rice "Hwa" and knife "Do".

629
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:36,110
Judging from the circumstances it seems that merchant group is related to Yeom Jong's group.

630
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,360
How is the task I gave to your Myo Jak Dan going?

631
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,910
 Myo Jak Dan. 

632
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,890
I've put people on it

633
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,060
so there will be a result soon.

634
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,500
Have you talked to Sam Bong about Yeom Jeong?

635
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,410
I did but...

636
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,570
Then...

637
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:01,100
So the reason why Sam Bong took Silla dynasty documents from the publications office

638
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,220
was that?

639
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,080
Did you know that too?

640
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,560
Yes. There's no place that our Nameless can't reach.

641
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,470
 Is there also a Nameless in the palace? 

642
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:18,030
But there's something a little weird.

643
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,880
With rights over personnel, finance, Do Dang

644
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,780
and military.

645
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,560
How can he also be in charge of the publications office?

646
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,260
Sam Bong is...

647
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,650
investigating Nameless' founder.

648
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,200
Follow

649
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,080
- Elder Sam Bong?
- Lord Sam Bong

650
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,350
has left for the border to do his duties as the border affairs official.

651
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,980
Carefully watch him.

652
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:50,050
Find out who he meets and what he does and report it to me.

653
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,230
Are you not going to answer?

654
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,300
I... Miss.

655
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,790
You said that you will continue working until you're done thinking it over.

656
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,000
Even after my husband gave you the opportunity to choose,

657
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,270
is there anything else that you need?

658
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,730
Yes, I understand.

659
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:15,510
- I will do that.
- Okay.

660
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,290
Ah, seriously.

661
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,170
What's going on again?

662
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:31,920
If we need to follow Lord Sam Bong, it has to be someone that he has never met.

663
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,710
Who would be good?

664
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,360
Well, there's Chil Bok and...

665
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,350
Right. This kid would be perfect.

666
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,030
- Son Dol is too young.
- I'm not young.

667
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,440
Also, I'm the best one in writing characters here.

668
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,730
We'd have to write down what we see him doing, right?

669
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:01,730
This punk is smarter than he looks.

670
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,250
Please don't worry.

671
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,440
I will do well.

672
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,130
Once I return, my wage will go up too.

673
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,870
Please tell Ajussi Chil Bok to come.

674
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:25,950


675
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,570
Is this Mansang Merchants?

676
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,620
Yes. The broker here arranged everything.

677
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,950
From here on, I am the owner of Saryang Group.

678
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:47,310
- Don't make any mistakes.
- I understand.

679
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,680
Oh, they're here.

680
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,770
Yes. It's been a long time.

681
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,070
He is the owner of Saryang Group.

682
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,210
- Nice to meet you.
- Ah,  yes.

683
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,550
You suffered a lot from your long journey.

684
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,760
The Yeojin tribe Chief Mo Hen Pa said he received the presents

685
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,690
and he's excited to make greats deals.

686
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,590
Thank you for organizing it.

687
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,710
Alright, you can follow me this way.

688
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,230
Did they go in there?

689
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,860
Yes. They went in there.

690
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,360
Then, write it down properly.

691
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:47,800
Mo Hen Pa has arrived at the border line. You can go now.

692
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,620
Well, this is it.

693
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,640
Then, I'm hoping for good business.

694
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,520
Thank you.

695
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,740
Thank you for agreeing to this deal.

696
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,670
This person is the owner of Saryang Group.

697
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,760
Sir, it's a pleasure to meet you.

698
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,880
Thank you for the gifts.

699
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,720
He said that it was a pleasure to meet you and that he received the gifts.

700
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,680
It's a gift of promise hoping for good business.

701
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:09,900
What kind of items are you selling?

702
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,360
They're silk and ginseng, right?

703
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,340
No.

704
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,010
It's quite cold.

705
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:27,620
We have crossed the border, right?

706
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,450
They look like the Yeojin tribe.

707
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:37,200
Just write down that they crossed the border and went into a certain barracks.

708
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,180
Yes.

709
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,570
I don't have an item.

710
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,670
What? Nothing... You don't have anything to sell, so why did you come here?

711
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,210
He asked why we came.

712
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:52,730
What I'm selling is not an item but land.

713
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,130
 Land? 

714
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,650
Land?

715
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:02,500
The rich and vast North Shimyang lands east of Yoha River.

716
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,320
What? What is this person saying?

717
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,910
So you bastard came here to fight.

718
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:28,230
Didn't I tell you that I came for business? I came to sell land, not just any item.

719
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:38,000
How would you be able to sell lands of North Shimyang?

720
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,070
You're not the owner of Saryang Group, right?

721
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,120
Of course that's it.

722
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:51,660
Who... are you?

723
00:53:53,930 --> 00:54:00,720
I was authorized by the new country Joseon's king and came here.

724
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:06,740
I am the Chief Commander of the National Army, the Chief Minister of State Affairs and the Chief Minister of Regional Administration--

725
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:15,270
Are you Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon?

726
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,160
He knows you.

727
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,370
I wanted to meet you.

728
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:34,130
We are not acquainted

729
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:44,390
but I respect Joseon's king, Lee Seong Gye.

730
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,320
Then, should we try to do some business?

731
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,150
Yes!

732
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,150
Thanks to you, the deal went well.

733
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,250
It seems that you already got the stamp.

734
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,270
Yes. It was refreshingly easy.

735
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:22,170
Didn't you come from Haejoo? I have a Hyung-nim who wants to ask you things related to Haejoo business.

736
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,580
Please stay for tea.

737
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,240
We...

738
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:33,140
It will only take a while.

739
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,550
Please wait for a bit. I will bring my Hyung-nim.

740
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,220
Did it go well?

741
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:54,440
I can't say everything is resolved now, but we stepped off on a good start.

742
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:00,310
Now, I have to meet Yeojin tribe chiefs like this.

743
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,110
Were you surprised earlier?

744
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:08,360
I got the gist of most of it, but can we really do that?

745
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:14,230
You don't have to think of it as urgent. We have to do it one step at a time.

746
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,620
What's the problem?

747
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,650
Is that this group's seal?

748
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,590
Seal.

749
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,810
Slice the seal in half.

750
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,760
Sir.

751
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,520
Now!

752
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,550
How did this...?

753
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,950
This is my Hyung-nim.

754
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,980
 Is that so? 

755
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:16,580
I am the owner of Saryang Group from Haejoo.

756
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:21,220
 Jeong Do Jeon. Why is this person... 

757
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,610
 Are you people with Nameless? 

758
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:50,300


759
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,340
 Six Flying Dragons 

760
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,250
 These merchants are Nameless .

761
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,070
 Right now everyone in the merchant group, 

762
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:58,950
 arrest all of them. 

763
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,610
 Sam Bong has found out. 

764
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,030
 This place is now dangerous. 

765
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,050
 Is Lord Sam Bong 

766
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,220
 planning something with a Yeojin tribe chief? 

767
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,070
 Someone stole the document they exchanged. 

768
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:09,960
 What are you saying? It got stolen? 

769
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,690
 You know what this red envelope is, right? 

770
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,490
 We're thinking of making a deal with you. 

771
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,690
 Is it so wrong for me to be in charge of this country? 

772
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:22,330
 I will end it fast in order for you to get rid of your greed, Your Highness.
