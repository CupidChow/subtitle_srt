 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,050
It's that person.

3
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,140
What do you mean?

4
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,210
No one was controlling him. He did it himself.

5
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,270
 Since you only chased the dead Lee In Gyeom, you have no choice but to be fooled 

6
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,970
 by me, Ha Ryun. 

7
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,120
 Episode 23 

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,250
I will go to Gaegyeong first.

9
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,090
It seems that you already have someone in mind.

10
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,070
Yes. Please come after dealing with the aftermath.

11
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,060
I have to look into how this happened.

12
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:41,380
It was definitely something that you had to discuss with me. Wasn't it?

13
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,980
Yes, but the Queen Dowager was desperate

14
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,360
and great scholar Lord Lee Saek also said it's reasonable...

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,880
Look here, General Jo!

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,450
"The eighteen offspring became the king!"
 (The Lee Family will become the king prophecy) 

17
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,960
That rumor has spread around.

18
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,300
How else would the Queen Dowager and Lord Lee Saek think?
   

19
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,320
I also didn't have a choice.

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,960
Did you also know about the Queen Dowager's command, Teacher?

21
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,840
Are you not even going to greet your teacher who you haven't seen for years?

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,010
Teacher, how could you do that?

23
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,070
Yes. Please tell us how it came to this.

24
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,290
The Queen Dowager is looking for you.

25
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,000
Please reinstate Lee In Gyeom.

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,400
He's a person who has assisted the royal family for a long time.

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,000
But Queen Dowager, that man is a criminal who is in exile.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,530
Lee In Gyeom is indeed a criminal,

29
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,710
but if you look at the horrible things that occurred in the Do Dang after he resigned,

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,500
we cannot say that he has only made a small contribution to that.

31
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,590
Yes, Lee In Gyeom has committed a lot of crimes, but is there anyone whose contributions can compare to his?

32
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,360
If you do that, he will repent his crimes, so please give him another chance.

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,560
But, Your Majesty...

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,910
I understand. Since you all think that way,
 (King Chang: Goryeo's 33rd King) 

35
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,400
I will reinstate Lee In Gyeom.

36
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,020
Young Master!

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,400
Where is the merchant?

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,410
He left a while ago. He hasn't come back yet.

39
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,830
How could you just let him leave?

40
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,460
You never told me to keep him here.

41
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,950
Why? Is there a problem?

42
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,030
We don't know a child like that?

43
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,790
Why wouldn't you? This is definitely Mal Seok's house.

44
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,880
He's this tall and is about 10 years old. His name is Mal Seok. Mal Seok.

45
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,170
Do you know a child called Mal Seok? Don't you know Mal Seok?
 (Moo Hyul) 

46
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,830
There's no child with that name in this neighborhood.

47
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,960
I should've known because his hands were not those of a merchant.

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,110
That's why you should've looked at it more carefully.

49
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,880
Who could it be?

50
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,420
The more I look at him, the more his physiognomy seems strange.

51
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,160
Who could it be? He looks like someone who's working under Sam Bong.

52
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,420
Elder. It seems like things are going awry.

53
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,260
What?

54
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,430
The people in the marketplace are making a fuss saying that General Jo will reinstate Lee In Gyeom.
 (Lee Sook Beon) 

55
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,330
What?

56
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,020
I didn't think about that.

57
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,780
What are you saying? They will call Lee In Gyeom back to Gaegyeong?

58
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,380
That's right. The Do Dang is in chaos.

59
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,660
This is not right. It's like taking credit for someone's hard work.

60
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,670
That's what I'm saying! We suffered and came back from the battlefield.

61
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,060
My goodness. I knew it would be like this.

62
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,500
Aigoo. I thought that a new world is going to come but it's all crap.

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,870
I don't even wish for a new world. Lee In Gyeom is the root of all evil. This is not right!

64
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,030
So what did the General say he would do?

65
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,940
I don't know. Everyone just went back angry.

66
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,660
For us to defeat the Do Dang Triumvirate, so much blood was spilled!

67
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,680
What nonsense are they saying now?

68
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,410
As if putting Crown Prince Chang on the throne is not enough,

69
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,870
weren't we back-stabbed by General Jo Min Soo?

70
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,430
This is nonsense! They will call Lee In Gyeom back to Gaegyeong?

71
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,260
How can something be so futile?

72
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,500
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

73
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,940
Have you heard? Lee In Gyeom will be reinstated.
 (Lee Bang Woo) 

74
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,150
They cannot call Lee In Gyeom back.

75
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,640
As expected, Hap Ha still has it. Shouldn't we immediately send someone to escort Hap Ha?

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,050
Yes. We have to send him a shiny and golden palanquin.

77
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,350
Isn't this Hap Ha's palanquin?

78
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,660
He couldn't have already arrived from Gyeongsanbu...

79
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,790
Hap Ha already predicted this would happen.

80
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,960
Let's hurry and go inside.

81
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Yes.

82
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,730
Why are you here?

83
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,830
What about Hap Ha?

84
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,910
Did you escort Hap Ha here?

85
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:05,310
About that...
 (Ha Ryun) 

86
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,670
Hap Ha cannot come.

87
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,300
Huh?

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,090
What are you saying?

89
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,060
I'll ask you a question right now.

90
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,400
Why do you think he's unable to come?

91
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,310
This...

92
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,010
His Majesty has ordered for Lee In Gyeom to be reinstated.

93
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:43,360
Nothing, not even His Majesty's command, can make that happen
 (Lee Bang Won) 

94
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,550
because he died.

95
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,370
Died? Who?

96
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,790
Lee In Gyeom. He has died from old age.

97
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,950
What? He died? When did he pass away?

98
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,180
Yes, unfortunately, he passed away fifteen days ago.

99
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,950
I have properly arranged his funeral.

100
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,470
This arrogant man! Then, did you pretend to be Hap Ha and fool all of us?

101
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,160
Yes. That's how it turned out.

102
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,740
But if I hadn't done that, would you even listened to my plan?

103
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,670
In the end, you would just waste time and

104
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,780
Goryeo's Royal court would become Lee Seong Gye's.

105
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,370
Look at it. Right now, how did the tables turn?

106
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,580
So what is it that you want?

107
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,640
My name, Ha Ryun,

108
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,490
is shorter than other people's names. You just have to keep those two words, Ha Ryun, in mind.

109
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,540
If you do that, you will come find me when you need me.

110
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,160
And when that time comes, you will probably give me a good position.

111
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,790
The Left Secretary of the Treasury that is in charge of trading cropsâ€”something like that?

112
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,990
If you give me a good position, then I will also give you a good gift.

113
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,230
You don't have to decide right away.

114
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,620
Please give it a thought.

115
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,070
Bon Won, have you heard?

116
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,470
I'm listening to it right now.

117
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,070
Is it true that Lee In Gyeom already died fifteen days ago?

118
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,720
Yes. It is true. I confirmed it at the Police Bureau.

119
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,460
Didn't you say that the merchant who spread the prophecy song said that he received baekmaehwa (silver coin used by Lee In Gyeom) from Lee In Gyeom?

120
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,060
Yes. He clearly said that he received them five days ago.

121
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,540
How can a person who died fifteen days ago order him to do that five days ago?

122
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,050
I think that the merchant has planned everything.

123
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,020
That person has disappeared and the child who told us about his whereabouts cannot be found.

124
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,210
Bon Won, just what--

125
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,210
Also, if we consider what Lee In Gyeom's servant said,
 (Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon) 

126
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,890
a relative through marriage came and asked him to keep the funeral a secret from Gaegyeong.

127
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,500
That's what he requested.

128
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,710
Relative through marriage? Just who could it be?

129
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,080
I do not know, however,

130
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,430
the merchant and the relative appeared to have the same burn mark on their wrists.

131
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,270
I think it's the same person.

132
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,160
Jo Min Soo didn't even know that Lee In Gyeom is dead

133
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,740
and recommended him to be reinstated.

134
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,260
Do you have someone in mind?

135
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,550
 Did he get a scar on his wrist in the past eight years? 

136
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:35,310
 There's only one person who is a relative of Lee In Gyeom who play such a bold prank. 

137
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,800
If I give you... If, right now, I give you the position, Left Secretary of the Treasury, what kind of gift are you going to give me?

138
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,200
Yes, I will tell you a little bit of it.

139
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,590
Say it.

140
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,830
About Woo Jae Jo Joon.

141
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:59,960
He is preparing something very terrifying that will put an end to the powerful and rich noble families.

142
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,910
What do you mean by that?

143
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,950
It's been a few years since that man's actions became unknown...

144
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,330
If you give me a good position... When that time comes,

145
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,700
I was thinking about telling you.

146
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,860
I will think about it. Will you come again?

147
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,880
Yes, of course.

148
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,760
Did it go well?

149
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,860
That doesn't matter. I've achieved my goal anyway.

150
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,960
Sook Beon, I think we're being followed.

151
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,970
I already felt it as soon as you came out.

152
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,920
Good for you, bastard. So what are we going to do?

153
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,310
That way... Quickly turn down that alley. Now!

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,460
Who are you? What are you doing?

155
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,470
It's been a while.

156
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,000
B-Brother?

157
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,540
 Who could it be? He has fearsome skill... 

158
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,440
It's been a while, Ho Jeong.
 (Ho Jeong: Ha Ryun's nickname) 

159
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,100
Yes, Brother. It's really been a long time. It's our first time meeting since 1375.

160
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,860
I heard that you've suffered from going into exile a number of times.

161
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,130
Your wrist wound looks like an iron mark. You got tortured, right?

162
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,220
Yes, well...

163
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,550
Why did you do it?

164
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,910
What do you mean?

165
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:07,810
Why did you help General Jo Min Soo? Tell me.

166
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,850
Indeed you're good. You know about it already.

167
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,540
Yes. I think that General Jo needed me.

168
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,220
General Lee Seong Gye already has you.

169
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,230
However, you--

170
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,390
"You don't have any interest in the affairs of the world, don't you?" You're going to say this, right?

171
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,730
And then, "So why did you do it?"

172
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,630
No. You have always been in the middle of the world's affairs.

173
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,160
Even during the Jang Pyeong Gate case and the Liaodong expedition... It's just that you weren't in the spotlight.

174
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,970
Yes, well...

175
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,820
You even went into exile too.

176
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,920
I always have this thought whenever I look at you.

177
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,240
"Even if Ha Ryun is against the Liaodong expedition, he's someone who is in that place."

178
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,190
Even if you were against having friendly relations with the Yuan, you were in that place. Something like this.

179
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,800
Did you sincerely oppose having friendly relations with the Yuan?

180
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:15,010
Did you really go into exile because you were so against the Liaodong expedition?

181
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,560
Your problem is that you are very good at seeing through someone.

182
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,400
Please don't do that. I feel guilty.

183
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,840
Don't act strong. That's also a bluff.

184
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,410
Now the question is why did I do that?

185
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:40,920
It is true that I'm in the center of the world's affairs but I'm actually not that interested in them.

186
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,990
Then, why did I always get involved?

187
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:52,210
Also, why did I put Prince Chang on the throne? Try to guess.

188
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,740
Someone who only has a hammer sees the whole world  as a nail.

189
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:06,060
Despite your learning and many talents, you don't have much interest for something such as a great cause.

190
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,990
So you probably knew that Crown Prince Chang and Jo Min Soo also have no great cause. It's only that...

191
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,150
Only what?

192
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,970
You're probably thinking of gaining fame by becoming a strategist.

193
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,850
As always, you're good at hitting people where it hurts.

194
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,660
I also have a question. What am trying to do? Try to guess.

195
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,360
Aren't you also good at face reading?

196
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,180
I don't know.

197
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,190
The matters of the world that you're playing with in your hands right now

198
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,410
are matters of the people, matters of the citizens.

199
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,170
They're not your toys.

200
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,130
Don't ever pull a prank like this.

201
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,430
Why are you being so serious?

202
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,140
You can just think of it as a sunbae and a hoobae from a long ago playing a game of baduk.

203
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,130
In all these years, you probably haven't won against me.

204
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,290
It was Ha Ryun.

205
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,230
Then, did Teacher Ha Ryun say he received orders from General Jo Min Soo?

206
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,580
It's probably not that. Jo Min Soo didn't even know that Lee In Gyeom is already dead.

207
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,070
Right. Fortunately, it wasn't done by Lee In Gyeom.

208
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,910
The Queen Dowager, Jo Min Soo, and Teacher Lee Saek enthroned the King, but because their power was Hap Ha

209
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,000
that alliance is still weak.

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,010
Then...

211
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,960
We must advance with the reformation work earlier than we thought.

212
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,540
But Jo Joon is still taking his time. What should we do?
 (Nam Eun) 

213
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,780
I will personally go this time

214
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,340
and settle this no matter what.

215
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,510
What? That person from earlier is the best swordsman in Goryeo?

216
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,020
- That's what I'm saying.
- Aish...

217
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,280
I almost died then!

218
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,310
You're very vague.

219
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,740
Your sword skill and your education...

220
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,520
I was originally a scholar but you made me keep holding on to a sword!

221
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,250
You also said that you'd make me great. Just when are you going to do it?

222
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,650
Ah, just wait! We have already achieved our first goal.

223
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,000
What was our goal?

224
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,930
Making people talk about my name!

225
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,330
Who?

226
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,280
Lee Seong Gye's people.

227
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,310
The more a person gets fooled, the more he carves it into his heart.

228
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,840
Did you say Ha Ryun?

229
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,670
Sam Bong is thinking that all of this was planned by Ho Jeong.
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

230
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:39,160
To think that he even dragged the Queen Dowager into this, is he really a great man?

231
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,150
 These people! 

232
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,960
 Open the door up right now! 

233
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,190
 What are you going to do? 

234
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,930
 I will stay back and guard the door. 

235
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,030
 A young and weak woman didn't even have a hint of hesitation in her.
(Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeong) 

236
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,570
 Did I just become indebted to her? 

237
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,770
They said it was Ha Ryun.

238
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,140
Yes, that is so, Father.

239
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,930
Ho Jeong Ha Ryun... He is quite out of it, but
 (Min Je: Haedong Gapjok's Head, nicknamed Yeo Eun) 

240
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,600
he's a person with many talents.

241
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,120
How so?

242
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,530
Unlike the other scholars, from astronomy, medicine, geomancy, geography, physiognomy, to fortune-telling,

243
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,450
he is a person who takes interest in all these fields.

244
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,060
I have to look into him then.

245
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,410
 Bi Guk Temple 

246
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,950
Such a beautiful woman.

247
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,370
Monk. We are monks.

248
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,030
That's right.

249
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,240
No way, she's our customer.

250
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,760
I would like it if she was.

251
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,360
Who is Jeok Ryong?

252
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,530
That is me. What's the matter?

253
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,560
I came to buy information from an information seller. Why else would I come?

254
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,780
Information about Ha Ryun...

255
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,200
Yes.

256
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,980
Who was he close to during his time at Seonggyungwan, who was he hostile to,

257
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,840
his actions before going into exile and after he went,

258
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,680
even his current state.

259
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,160
Please find out everything to know about that person.

260
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,600
That's not hard, but

261
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,460
if you tell me the reason why you're looking into Ha Ryun,
 (Jeok Ryeong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk) 

262
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,300
I will return this much to you.

263
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:04,290
So this is one of Bi Guk Temple's ways of gathering information.

264
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,250
You want to hear the information from a client?

265
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,450
As I have heard, you are indeed intelligent.

266
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,310
Woo Jae!
 (Jo Joon's nickname) 

267
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,350
Look here, Woo Jae! Are you in there?!

268
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,410
- Argh!
- What the...

269
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,570
What in the world was that for?

270
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,380
Sam Bong, you sent them, right?

271
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,560
Because you can't persuade me,

272
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,000
you sent someone to steal my data, right?

273
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,710
What are you talking about?

274
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,310
Excuses... Forget it! Get the hell out!

275
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,570
What do you mean that someone came? Did they get stolen?

276
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,390
Did you lose those materials?

277
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,890
Now, you will never find them.

278
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,170
I've hid them really well somewhere.

279
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,560
Don't ever try to think of doing useless things.

280
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,120
Look here. Look here, Woo Jae! Listen to what I have to say.

281
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,270
Look here! Listen to what I have to say at least!

282
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,060
I sent people?

283
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,500
Could it be that someone knows about the work Woo Jae was doing?

284
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,600
My assumption was right.

285
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,180
Sam Bong and Woo Jae are connected.

286
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,320
What? We saw it together. Sam Bong got totally rejected.

287
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,680
In the end, Sam Bong will gain Woo Jae's trust

288
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,090
and things will start.

289
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,330
Brother, how come the best swordsman is working so hard on training?

290
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,600
To discourage the other warriors?

291
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,530
Exactly that.

292
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,380
You seem really happy today.

293
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,080
Ajussi said that he'll finally start business.

294
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,760
If it really works...

295
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,100
Oh, you're here.

296
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,000
You have to gather the marketplace members. They have something to do.

297
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,450
Aigoo, that... Are you Teacher Jo Joon?

298
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,150
Ah, who are you? Right. I am Jo Joon.

299
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,470
But what's the matter?

300
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,290
Aigoo. We feel deeply sorry for this.

301
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,810
What? Sorry? What are you sorry for?

302
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,170
The Leader told us to politely escort you, but

303
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,290
we don't know how to do such things.

304
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,550
What are you doing?

305
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,440
 These punks, let me out of here! 

306
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,300
Sam Bong, Sam Bong! What on earth is this?!

307
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,690
I'm sorry, but it is urgent.

308
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,970
So?

309
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,730
After having done such great research, why do you not reveal to the world?

310
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,010
It's something that will not happen!

311
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,230
In the end, it will never happen!

312
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,290
Who can decide on whether it will happen or not?

313
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,940
I did this research myself.

314
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,100
I will judge my research. Who else can judge it?

315
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,910
- You cannot judge it.
- What?

316
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,850
Wait, what?

317
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,550
Chang Danhyun Heuk Seong district of Gyeonggi-do. Those who are from that place, step forward!

318
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:11,790
Those who are from Deok Jinhyeon Western district of Yanggwang-do step forward!

319
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,820
Look at these people.

320
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,200
This data that you made while going around the country for a long time,

321
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,920
look at what it means.

322
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,300
After enacting the Land Distribution Law, the land that the people of Dukjin-hyun can have amounts to an area of 1 gyeol 4 dong.

323
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,180
This number that you have calculated...

324
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,480
This is the area of land that these people need to have.

325
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,140
It's the hope these people need and the food that will keep them alive.

326
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,040
It will become our land?

327
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,680
Over the years, you got abandoned by King Gong Min,

328
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,750
got persecuted by the Do Dang Triumvirate, and after General Choi Yeong ostracized you,

329
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,710
you researched the land problem of the whole country like a madman.

330
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,650
Aren't these people the real meaning behind that?

331
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,890
For these people, for this country's people, taking the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok's land and dividing them equally.

332
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,550
Isn't that your dream?

333
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:36,000
 So it's the thing that I've seen before. Dividing the land according to the number of the people. 

334
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,300
But with you just hiding this data, you are only wasting time.

335
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,070
Because it will not happen.

336
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,060
This country is not capable of doing that!

337
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,440
Then, why do you still have it? Why didn't you burn it?

338
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,540
You have made a great collection of data.

339
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,120
Because you made it, is it wholly yours?

340
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,040
Do you have the right to hide such an amazing thing from the world?

341
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,160
No, nobody in this world has that right!

342
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,820
Those people, all of the citizens can have their own lands, but

343
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,300
if someone stubbornly tells them they can't, can you lay down that fault on anyone?

344
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,560
Let's do it together.

345
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:52,520
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

346
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,400
How can you do that to me and the Queen Dowager?

347
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,970
- To stop Sam Bong.
- What?

348
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,310
I'm trying to stop the dangerous thing that Sam Bong is doing.

349
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,570
How can Sam Bong be dangerous?

350
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,680
For example, it's like this.

351
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,930
To someone who only has a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail.

352
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,820
What?

353
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,700
What could Sam Bong's hammer be?

354
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,300
It's his ideas. Even looking back to his Seonggyungwan days,

355
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,890
his dangerous ideas!

356
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,710
So?

357
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,810
Colleague Sam Bong will definitely try to change the system that is the foundation of our country.

358
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,190
A country's system?

359
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,670
It's probably the land system.

360
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,300
For a long time, Jo Joon has been going around the country preparing for something.

361
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,240
What is he preparing?

362
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,280
I have my suspicions,

363
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,820
but first,I'll try to find more about it.

364
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:16,050
Can you do this? Seriously?

365
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,160
The Land Distribution Law was turned down, and redistributing the stolen lands has failed as well. 
 (Jo Joon) 

366
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,130
King Gong Min and even General Choi Yeong.

367
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,840
But Sam Bong, you're saying you have the power to do it?

368
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,970
It's not my strength, it's General Lee Seong Gye's strength.

369
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,890
Lee Seong Gye?

370
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,970
The land that General Lee Seong Gye's family received from previous generations,

371
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,100
I know how much it is without you telling me.

372
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,740
But that person is going to do this?

373
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,100
Meet General Lee Seong Gye with me. Then, you will understand.

374
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,810
Brother.

375
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,290
If this really works...

376
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,150
If that really happens...

377
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,940
About my dream that I couldn't tell you last time.
 (Boon Yi) 

378
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:21,740
You and I going back to our village in the Western district

379
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,520
and farming our own land.

380
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,480
My dream was to live happily like that and have a family.

381
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,640
It would be nice if you have the same dream as I.

382
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,610
If that ajussi earlier helps us a little more,

383
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:54,260
I think my dream will really come true.

384
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,970
Leader Boon Yi!

385
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,340
Come here.

386
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,780
What was the ajussi from earlier talking about?

387
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,130
It's called a Land Distribution Law.

388
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,080
It was something that was enforced in the Zhou Dynasty.

389
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,640
So that Land Distribution and Zhou Dynasty stuff.

390
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,910
So does that mean they will give us the land or not?

391
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,090
It is about dividing the land evenly.

392
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,830
Is this true? We will also have our lands?

393
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,000
What did I say? If you just listen to Leader Boon Yi's words,

394
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,150
even while sleeping, you will get land.

395
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,320
Boon Yi, thank you. Thank you very much!

396
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,270
However, that...

397
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,250
To be able to do that, we have to confiscate the land from the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok who has it now.

398
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,040
That fight won't be easy.

399
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,320
That's right. Who will easily give land away?

400
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,240
Still, let's wait and see.

401
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,170
If that kind of world comes...

402
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,720
When Bon Won comes, please tell him to review this.

403
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Yeon Hee.

404
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,070
Really...

405
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,690
If the thing that you do works out,

406
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,640
will the world that you wish for come?
 (Lee Bang Ji) 

407
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,560
If this ends...

408
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,840
What will you do after?

409
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,970
For Boon Yi,

410
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,860
when that day comes,

411
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,170
she will go back to our village, farm,

412
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,180
and have a family.

413
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,330
It's her dream to live like that.

414
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,760
That's so Boon Yi.

415
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,060
That will happen. That dream
 (Yeon Hee) 

416
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,090
will come true.

417
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,090
Let's work harder.

418
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,450
â™«  Maybe that's why it will not work  â™«

419
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,770
Do you want to go together?

420
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:49,240
â™«  I won't be able to see you  â™«

421
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,220
â™«  That one name  â™«

422
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,830
â™«  I cannot say it so in my heart  â™«

423
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,830
â™«  I bury it  â™«

424
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,080
No. I don't want to.

425
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,950
â™«  Because you rise up in me  â™«

426
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:17,750
â™«  Because I can't hold you  â™«

427
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,540
â™«  Just that which resemble you  â™«

428
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:30,960
â™«  Just that tear flows  â™«

429
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,370
â™«  Because it's stained in my breath â™« 

430
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:38,740
 Thank you for asking, Ddang Sae. 
â™«  Because it's engraved in my body  â™«

431
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:45,590
â™«  The more I try to forget, the more painful it is  â™«

432
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:52,450
â™«  In my frozen heart that seems to have stopped  â™«

433
00:35:52,450 --> 00:36:00,270
â™«  The time that is you flows  â™«

434
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,130
The person that Sam Bong recommended for Chief Inspector General,
 (Lee Seong Gye) 

435
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,810
is called Jo Joon?

436
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,810
Yes. He's someone that we definitely need for our work.

437
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,100
You must surely keep him by your side.

438
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,990
He's at the Ga Byeol Cho right now.

439
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,670
Then, I will sincerely meet with him.

440
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,130
Ah, Master, you're really good with your alcohol.

441
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:41,550
If someone practices enough martial arts like me,

442
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,540
no matter how much I drink, I don't get drunk!

443
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,410
Oh, is that so?

444
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,160
Aigoo.. Oh, General. General.

445
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,440
It's this guy. He's of great talent.

446
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,100
My name is Lee Seong Gye.

447
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,390
Yes, yes.

448
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,870
I have heard many good things about you from Sam Bong.

449
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:15,380
So are you thinking of using my research?

450
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,520
Of course.

451
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,480
Do you know what it is?

452
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,310
I heard about it and came here.

453
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,510
Can you really do it?

454
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,290
Of course. I will definitely do it.

455
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,370
Good. If what you're saying is true,

456
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,700
if you're that desperate,

457
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,090
then why don't you try kneeling down.

458
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,060
Teacher, I think you've had too much to drink.

459
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,860
Let's talk tomorrow when you're sober.

460
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm a man who's always drinking except when I'm sleeping

461
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,300
so there will not be a time for us to talk when i'm sober.

462
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,970
Kneel down.

463
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,910
Look here, Woo Jae!

- Didn't you hear it? He told me to kneel down.

466
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,080
You have to gain Jo Joon's trust.

467
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,360
So? are you asking me to kneel?

468
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,220
Can you serve a master who kneels down in front of a stranger?

469
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,610
I'm not telling you to kneel. I'm saying that you must gain that person's trust.

470
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,030
Didn't he tell me to kneel down? I can't.

471
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,870
If he's someone that we really need, persuade him yourself.

472
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:11,520
I can't. Gaining someone's heart cannot be done with strategies.

473
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,300
The only thing that I can do is

474
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,650
bring that person in front of you.

475
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,670
Jo Joon is just asking about your resolve.

476
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,160
The Land Distribution Law that we chose, the way of land system reformation

477
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,350
is that much of a dangerous and difficult path.

478
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,920
Even if it's difficult, how can I?

479
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,690
It's ten, no, a hundred times harder than establishing a country and changing the king.

480
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,660
What is the Land Distribution Law? What is the Equal Land Division?

481
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,120
It is about confiscating every bit of land in this country

482
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,860
and dividing it among the people.

483
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,610
The resolve he probably wants from you is

484
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,820
saying, "I will also give away my land,"

485
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,260
even your wife's Kang family will also give away their lands.

486
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,440
Isn't it supposed to be at least this?

487
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,790
If we are to carry out the Equal Land Division, then we need to take away all of General Lee Ji Ran's lands.

488
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,640
Even the land of your sons' private houses needs to be confiscated.

489
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,120
The ones who helped you and put their lives on the line for you,

490
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,560
we need to confiscate the lands of the closest people to you.

491
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,660
If there are any that resist, then we need to quell them with military power.

492
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,000
Blood can be spilled among family and comrades.

493
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,260
"You might be able to forget your father's enemy,

494
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,930
but the person who stole your land will be carved in your heart

495
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,630
and will never be forgotten."

496
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,240
The cheers of the people who will receive lands

497
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,290
can only be slightly heard from far away, but

498
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,720
the curses, hatred, and resentment of the people who got their lands taken

499
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,500
will be heard closely

500
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,800
and loudly for a long time.

501
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,120
Jo Joon is asking for that resolve.

502
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,000
His nature is originally rough so

503
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,060
he told you to kneel down.

504
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,820
I already have that resolve.

505
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,740
But, the method to show him my decision

506
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,350
will be arranged by me.

507
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,600
Let's go to him again.

508
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,830
Let's see, alcohol...

509
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,760
You do the kneeling, Teacher.

510
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,570
Look at this mess...

511
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,330
If I don't kneel, are you going to cut my head off?

512
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,280
I, Lee Seong Gye, have lived my lifeâ€”

513
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,370
Look at this, look at this. Yes, yes!

514
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:49,750
Of course, you haven't knelt down except  when you do memorial services.

515
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,770
No. I have knelt before.

516
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,290
I knelt down before someone in my past while swearing my loyalty and friendship.

517
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:09,410
A few years later, I betrayed him and killed him with my own hands.

518
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:19,410
Thus, what kind of trust can my kneeling give you?

519
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,540
However, you see...

520
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,090
I have never betrayed anyone who knelt before me.

521
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,070
Your study is yours.

522
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:39,990
If you want your research to be widely used in the world, kneel before me.

523
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,770
I will surely make it happen for you.

524
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,880
Land Distribution Law?

525
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:00,890
I roughly heard it from Teacher Mok Eun but do you have the basis for that? How did you know?

526
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:06,910
Where should I start... If I were to shorten it,

527
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:11,660
I was following someone while on a personal task,

528
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:17,450
but I realized that he was also following someone else.

529
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,340
That person being followed is none other than

530
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:26,820
Jo Joon whose whereabouts have been unknown for a long time.

531
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,260
I found out that Jo Joon was secretly preparing something in a cave.

532
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,520
I was curious so I went into that cave.

533
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,510
That place contained

534
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,470
a great amount of amazing things.

535
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,740
What is that?

536
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,770
The total area of farm land and the number of farmers across the whole country.

537
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:12,580
And not only that, land possessions that have not been recorded officially in the Revenue Department.

538
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:22,080
To simply put it, this country's Gwon Moon Sae Jeok,

539
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:29,380
and the Sadaebu's corrupt and illegal doings were recorded.

540
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:39,360
Where is Jo Joon's data right now?

541
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,270
Really, isn't that true?

542
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,610
Would I even do that? tell me in detail.

543
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:53,780
Actually, a few days ago, a thief went to my house.

544
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,190
The other things weren't touched. Only the books were turned over.

545
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,500
Of course, they weren't able to steal anything.

546
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,280
I personally saw the thief as he was running away.

547
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,550
The movements were not ordinary.

548
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,020
He seemed like a skilled assassin.

549
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,960
Isn't it someone under Ha Ryun?

550
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,690
Whoever it is, he is already after you

551
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:21,710
and if he's after your data, then it's not an ordinary thing.

552
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,400
Where is your data?

553
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,320
I moved it to a secret place. I even drew a map.

554
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,290
Bang Won, you've to go somewhere.

555
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,400
Yes, Teacher.

556
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,260
Take Bang Ji and Moo Hyul with you.

557
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,950
Do you know where the data is right now?

558
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:44,070
Yes. I already figured it out. I will get it.

559
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,670
What is it that you want?

560
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:55,770
I might need some defense so I have to use people. I would need wealth for that.

561
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,000
Also...

562
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,290
If I bring it to you,

563
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,320
What about a position as Left Secretary of the Treasury.

564
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,600
Don't worry. Hurry and push ahead.

565
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,440
Yes.

566
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,300
But who is the person you were originally following?

567
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,890
Didn't you say that you were following someone before finding that out?

568
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:29,910
It's something personal that is not connected to this.

569
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:40,290
Woo Hak Joo. How can he ask that? I didn't know what to do for a second there.

570
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,450
What do you mean?

571
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,990
That...

572
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:49,360
 Look into the organization that has this pattern. 

573
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,290
Then this is...

574
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,230
That's correct.
 (Lee In Gyeom) 

575
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:03,710
 The one who put me into Do Hwa Jeon and made me hold on to Goryeo. 

576
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,660
 It's that secretive organization. 

577
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,380
 I am Eunuch Kim Nae Pyeong. 

578
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,670
 That man said his name is Kim Nae Pyeong. 

579
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:26,430
 But that person doesn't exist. 

580
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,110
 Yes, Elder. I will look into it. 

581
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,190
 The day I left Do Hwa Jeon, 

582
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,080
 that came again. 

583
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:52,080
 That day, I saw Kim Nae Pyeong again. 

584
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,390
 I have figured out Kim Nae Pyeong's whereabouts. 

585
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,390
 I almost have it, Elder. Please find strength. 

586
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:03,410
 Now... 

587
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,610
 I think it's something you'll have to do. 

588
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:17,880
 You must expose that existence. 

589
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,910
It was that man, Kim Nae Pyeong who was following Jo Joon.

590
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:27,000
So did you tell them that it was Grandfather's will?

591
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,770
Grandfather? It's Hap Ha!

592
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:32,790
Follow me.

593
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,770
To where?

594
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:39,750
We have to buy people now that we have the wealth.

595
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,240
Right now?

596
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,450
Yeah, right now.

597
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,150
We need to safely take Teacher Jo Joon's data.

598
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:59,440
Let's go now. It's in the Dongjin marketplace, so if we go now we'll arrive in the evening.

599
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,530
Excuse me, may I go too?

600
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:08,510
Lady, you already heard it. Other people are after it too. It might be dangerous. Don't  go.

601
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:12,510
Since you said it might be dangerous, I must go.

602
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:18,660
It's my dream and the other members' dreams as well. How can I just calmly wait?

603
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,880
But if things get dangerous...

604
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,620
Let's go then. I'll be responsible for you.

605
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,120
Why would you? I'll be responsible for my sister. Let's go Boon Yi.

606
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:45,540
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

607
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,250
I'll also take responsibility. Who wouldn't? I'll also take that responsibility.

608
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,840
Here it is. This should be enough.

609
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,390
The last time you came, you were dressed discourteously  from head to toe.

610
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,580
Discourtesy? I was pretending to be a merchant.

611
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:17,620
If I only knew who you were before, I would have helped you even without this.
 (Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan's Owner) 

612
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,760
Please give me at least 20 spies. The skilled ones.

613
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,210
Absolutely.

614
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,170
What about the other 19?

615
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,040
They will meet us on the way there. Let's go.

616
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,910
Give me a second.

617
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:43,350
Watch over Jeong Do Jeon's movements.

618
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:47,730
If there are any strange movements, tell me right away.

619
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,150
Yes, I understand.

620
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,110
It should be around here.

621
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,930
I think it's that way.

622
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,780
Brother, what's wrong?

623
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,460
Nothing, let's go.

624
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:35,070
This place? The lights are off and it seems that nobody's inside.

625
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,890
Should I try knocking one time?

626
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:43,010
No. We have a promised code. Three, two, one, three.

627
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,780
You sure it's 3, 2, 1, 3?

628
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,040
It should be right.

629
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,070
 There's a scent of blood. 

630
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,820
Move.

631
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,110
He's dead.

632
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,910
Look here, look here!

633
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,500
We were sent by Teacher Jo Joon. What happened?

634
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,080
They took it.

635
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,320
Those guys...

636
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,510
It was those guys earlier.

637
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,410
Quick, they can't be that far...

638
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,950
Moo Hyul, let's go.

639
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,200
Hurry and go. I will take care of this person.

640
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,650
Did you get it?

641
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,360
Yes, we did.

642
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,850
Is the Monk here yet?

643
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,110
They will be here soon.

644
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:32,030
 Excuse us! Right here! 

645
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,210
Pardon us! Look here!

646
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:39,930
Aigoo. We still caught up.

647
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,860
Why? Why? Why?

648
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,940
What's the matter?

649
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,720
The house owner is looking for you.

650
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,660
How can you just go and leave him behind?

651
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,990
What?

652
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,290
I didn't want to see blood.

653
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,170
Let's deal with it nicely.

654
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,480
Even now that I became the best swordsman,

655
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,600
you're still jumping on me, you guys.

656
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,460
That's right. You're not even a tiny bit scary.

657
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,650
Catch that guy!

658
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,580
Kill all of us.

659
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,830
That's how you can go.

660
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,520
If you come closer, one of us will surely die.

661
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,040
So you're from Hwa Sa Dan.

662
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,700
She's dead.

663
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,440
Goodbye.

664
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,680
Wait.

665
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,010
What's wrong?

666
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,390
We can't decide on whether he lives or dies.

667
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,030
Let's take him.

668
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:49,410
 I lost in terms of strength? 

669
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,230
That merchant from before?

670
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:40,930
No. Teacher Ha Ryun who  was disguised as a merchant.

671
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,630
 Gil Sun Mi 

672
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:53,070
I was extremely curious about who you are.

673
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,590
Lee Bang Won, you say?

674
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:16,750
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

675
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,220
 Six Flying Dragons 

676
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,000
 Why do you follow Jeong Do Jeon? Your physiognomy is not ordinary. 

677
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,860
 You're now crawling out and wanting a fight, Ha Ryun? 

678
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:37,770
Protest the destruction of the previous system and redistribution of taxed lands.

679
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:40,630
 Teacher, you must protect Jo Min Soo. 

680
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,970
 Please assemble the army. 

681
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:44,730
 What about tonight? Please come to Do Hwa Jeon. 

682
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:49,670
 Prepare in a way that no one will leave alive.
