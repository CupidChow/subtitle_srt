 Episode 15 

3
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,730
 The air is filled with the thirst for blood. 

4
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,650
 Hurry and send the troops! 

5
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,590
 No, I'll go. 

6
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,470
 Ahjussi!

8
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,150
 I will not... 

9
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,170
 be fooled by you people anymore. 

10
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,770
 Is it because of my mood? What is this weird feeling of a thirst for blood? 

11
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,950
I am sorry but can you go around that way? We have something important to do here.

12
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,970
Elder! Run away!

13
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,350
You just heard something right?

14
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,450
Yes, Young Master.

15
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,370
What are you doing?  Let's hurry!

16
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,130
Yeon Hee!

17
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,910
What are you doing? Get away quickly!

18
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,090
Let's go.

19
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,550
Byeok Sa Gae? You use him? Aigo. It's probably really expensive.

20
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,370
Is he really that great?

21
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,050
Well,among the assassins he is quite good.

22
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,410
Then if he fights with you, who wins?

23
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,410
With me?

24
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,230
Of course I win. I will completely beat him.

25
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,510
You probably will.

26
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,530
But to be honest, I don't like fighting with that guy Byeok Sa Gae.

27
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,130
Why?

28
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,550
Because it is not one guy.

29
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,310
Throw away your sword!

30
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,910
What's your name? Your name.

31
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,170
God, your name! I have to know your name in order to put it on my record.

32
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,570
What is your name? Your name!

33
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,710
Are you okay teacher? Do not worry now.

34
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,390
Ajussi!

35
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,630
Ajussi! Ajussi...

36
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,470
Yes, I am fine. I'm fine.

37
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,330
Sam Bong. What happened?

38
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,020
Even you, the general, came?

39
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,090
I am fine.

40
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:10,230
I will definitely find out who is behind this, even if I have to chew them off.

41
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,710
 How come there's no blood on the sword? 

42
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,370
No way...

43
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,830
No way...

44
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,350
Brother?

45
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,400
Brother Ddang Sae?

46
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,810
Boon Yi!

47
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,030
Are you?

48
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,890
Is that you?

49
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,370
Boon Yi.

50
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,730
Are you my brother?

51
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,330
Boon...

52
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,650
Brother...

53
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,990
Is it really you, Brother?

54
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,560
Are you really Brother Ddang Sae?

55
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,240
I am your brother.

56
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,160
Then why?

57
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,440
How can my brother

58
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,980
fight this well?

59
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,770
How can a weak person like you fight so well?

60
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,930
How did you spend the past years?

61
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,050
It's because of me, right?

62
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,510
It's because of

63
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,770
the childish thing I said to you, right?

64
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,530
No Boon Yi, it's not.

65
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,390
I'm sorry brother.

66
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,120
Back then I did not even know what I was saying.

67
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,590
I'm sorry.

68
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,960
No way...

69
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,200
Your right, it's Yeon Hee Unni.

70
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,680
Long time no see Boon.

71
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,930
She was part of this group long before you joined.

72
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,350
Unni how did you?

73
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,460

74
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,910
 Why did you come now? You said you would only look for a while.  

75
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,810
 No it's not, Ddang Sae.  

76
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,750
  You are not a scary cat. It's also not your fault. 

77
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,300
 The world is just weird.  

78
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,650
 Do you truly trust me? 

79
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,770
 How can I not trust 

80
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,770
  the earnest feelings I feel from you? 

81
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,180
 Yeon Hee and Boon Yi. 

82
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,960
 Let them out. 

83
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,150
 If a single thing is not done correctly 

84
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,060
 I do not know what I'll do to you. 

85
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,900
I will stay here.

86
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,810
W-What did you say?

87
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,790
If there is a use for me.

88
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,330
Are you serious? Are you really going to do that?

89
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,830
I still do not believe in your words,

90
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,080
but since my former people

91
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,390
are dreaming of the world you are trying to create, I will not dream but with both eyes open

92
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,450
I will watch by your side.

93
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,270
Also I will

94
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,850
try to protect that dream, although I do not believe in it.

95
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,390
Thank you. Sincerely.

96
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,640
If there is a use for this body

97
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,940
use it anytime.

98
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,240
What did you just say?

99
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,660
Among the three Byeok Sa Gae, two died and one was captured.

100
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,720
They failed?

101
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,850
On top of that, captured?

102
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,390
There was a intruder. It's that guy.

103
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,460
What do you mean by that guy?

104
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,100
The guy that killed Baek Yoon and tried to kill you.

105
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,110
What are you talking about? When they tried to kill Sam Bong that guy appeared

106
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,100
and killed two of the Byeok Sa Gae and saved Sam Bong?

107
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,390
No. No way!

108
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,310
That means that warrior was not Hap Ha's person.

109
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:07,340
Then, from the beginning, he was someone Sam Bong raised?

110
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,840
Were we fooled by Sam Bong from the start?

111
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,680
This...

112
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,230
You saved Sam Bong's life. You really did a great thing.

113
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:29,930
Also, since you are going to work with us, I am thankful for that as well.

114
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,700
So, what is your name?

115
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,620
I am Ddang Sae.

116
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,790
Ddang Sae , with such frightful sword skills, that does not suit you.

117
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,620
Older brother, make him a decent and a big name for him.

118
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:59,340
Yes... I will treat you as one of my sons from now on.

119
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,240
Why don't you use Bang as in beauty of the flower?
(all his sons use Bang)

120
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:11,320
Since you said you are Ddang Sae, use your Ddang and  have  your name as Lee Bang Ji.

121
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,760
 Lee Bang Ji... 

122
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,630
 AIsh. I'm jealous. 

123
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,230
Also, since Sam Bong's life can be in danger again,

124
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,790
you will be Sam Bong's personal warrior.

125
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,100
Yes, I will do that.

126
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,080
I also know

127
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,730
that Ddang Sae is a victim.

128
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,000
It's also not something I can forgive him for.

129
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,790
That's why my heart aches

130
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,930
and hurts when I see his eyes.

131
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,380
Will you be okay?

132
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,880
You have to do this work together.

133
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,140
It's malicious, fate is.

134
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,890
What can I do?

135
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,790
Take good care of Ddang Sae.

136
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,180
It will be hard, Unni.

137
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,280
Let's live a hard life.

138
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,120
No.

139
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,730
I don't intend to live a hard life anymore.

140
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,580
I want to live a new life and only want to get stronger.

141
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,960
I don't want to protect you anymore.

142
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,990
As you said, it's a disastrous time. You can only live by protecting yourself.

143
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,280
Each person is fighting with disastrous time.

144
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,340
That is just how I set my mind.

145
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,770
Fine.

146
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,430
Let's do that.

147
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,390
Comrade.

148
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,730
♫  Someday, at the end of my lif,  ♫

149
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:48,490
♫  I will call for you like crazy  ♫

150
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:55,380
♫  You, who resemble my tears  ♫

151
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:05,570
♫  I miss you the more I love you  ♫

152
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,720
Why are you like this? What's wrong?

153
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,000
Why are you like this? Who did this to you?

154
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,560
I said who did it?

155
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,360
The world.

156
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,830
This country

157
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,610
Those Do Dang people...

158
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,080
Okay, okay. I'll put an end to everything.

159
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,880
That's right.

160
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,900
Let's put an end to it together.

161
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,310
What do I do about my brother?

162
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,520
What do I do about Unni Yeon Hee?

163
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,620
They're both so miserable. What do I do?

164
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,780
Move, you bastard.

165
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,590
Aren't you Minister Gil Tae Mi?

166
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,050
It's okay. Go ahead.

167
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,350
Yes.

168
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,130
Why did you come to this shabby place in the middle of the day?

169
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,840
Forget it.

170
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,330
Hey, Jeong Do Jeon!

171
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,210
Since when were we being played into your hands?

172
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,330
You also killed Baek Yoon, right?

173
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,470
You ordered that swordsman who saved you.

174
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,860
Don't you think that

175
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,270
you look really laughable, Elder Minister?

176
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,620
What?

177
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,520
Take your sword away and leave!

178
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,020
If that arrow flies,

179
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,730
do you think I can block it or not?

180
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,400
Even if you are the best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms,

181
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,220
my arrow is different.

182
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,990
Really?

183
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,630
Should we make a bet?

184
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,850
Whether I can block that arrow and kill this bastard or not.

185
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,860
Yes. You two should make a bet.

186
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,160
Even if you die here,

187
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,090
I will stand witness for the general that it was just a reasonable defense.

188
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,430
You barged in here in the middle of the day and brandished your sword.

189
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,760
Do that. Make a bet.

190
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,080
I was thinking of digging for it,

191
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,250
the identity of the swordsman who appeared to save you at Yeo Am Jeong.

192
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,280
Just keep on digging then.

193
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,560
We'll also dig on who's behind the assassin we captured.

194
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,030
This is driving me crazy.

195
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,440
- Hyung-nim!
- Father!

196
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,410
It's done. It's over!

197
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,070
I'm curious.

198
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,600
Who would have died if we'd decided to make a bet earlier?

199
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,660
Ah, I don't know.

200
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,470
Big brother, what should I do with that bastard?

201
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,370
Doo Rim District and Ji Han District,

202
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,150
Hyeon Deok District and Min Seo District.

203
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,960
Don't these places bother you at all?

204
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,020
What do you mean by that?

205
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,560
What kind of work did you do?

206
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:28,010
I am asking if these lands are owned by those who do not contribute anything to this country.

207
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,700
If they repent for the things they did and give their land to the country

208
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,110
tell them I will take good care of them.

209
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,020
But if they don't,

210
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,720
show them the power of Soojungmok Gongmoon.
 (Soojungmok Gongmoon - removal of land rights without  just cause.) 

211
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,620
Yes. Let's go.

212
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,670
- You're here.
- In-law.

213
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,020
Land is good too,

214
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,860
but I think that we shouldn't continue like this.

215
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,710
What are you saying?

216
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,750
About the Haedong Gapjok.
 (Haedong Gapjok: prestigious families with political authority.)  

217
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,670
They disregarded you and chose Lee Seong Gye.

218
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,170
They rejected you.

219
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,030
Yes. So...

220
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,080
For rejecting my marriage request and going for Lee Seong Gye's family and marriage request,

221
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,040
I was thinking of letting them know

222
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,710
how poor their judgement was.

223
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,190
Okay.

224
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,500
So you're entering into a marriage with Haedong Gapjok's Hwang Ryeo Min family?
 (Choi Yeong) 

225
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,110
Yes. That's what happened.

226
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,880
You know,

227
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,150
Goryeo is maintained because of nobles like the Haedong Gapjok.

228
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,420
They protect the national laws and foundations and are Goryeo's leaders.

229
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,580
But they are not participating in politics at all and are only thinking of themselves.

230
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,270
But...

231
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,790
If those people made their decision, the tides would change.

232
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,080
Like when they put up King Tae Jo.

233
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,230
Now that you have become their in-law, do a good job at persuading them

234
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,630
to move into politics.

235
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:21,090
Groom and bride, bow to each other!

236
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,330
Groom and bride, share the wine!

237
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,170
Are you like that because of Young Master's wedding?

238
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,620
What?

239
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,060
Why would I be?

240
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,410
I don't think much but I'm not a fool.

241
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,270
A person's heart usually does what it wants,

242
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,900
so it doesn't consider things like status and circumstance.

243
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,510
"Young Master is our rice cooker who provides for us."

244
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,010
Just think like this.

245
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,700
Rice cooker...

246
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,760
That's good. Lee Bang Won Rice Cooker.

247
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,180
Rice Cooker.

248
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,420
Warrior-nim, you're so transparent.

249
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,190
That's because you say it nicely

250
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,600
but in a bad way, really ignorant?

251
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,410
You take care of your family and you learn sword skills.

252
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,810
That's why you also said you'd make your name known.

253
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,500
It would have been nice if my brother had been like that too.

254
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,320
If for that reason...

255
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,660
Anyway, you're a totally normal person, Warrior-nim.

256
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,320
In this Goryeo, there are only a few people who are normal and ordinary.

257
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,000
Warrior-nim, you are Goryeo's hope.

258
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,500
Hope?

259
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,910
Yes.

260
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:46,100
My goal is make a country with many people like you.

261
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,820
Lee Bang Won Rice Cooker will probably be the same.

262
00:28:53,290 --> 00:29:00,780
♫  You appear  ♫

263
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:09,840
♫  I recognized you a few times
Thanks to you, I am alive  ♫

264
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,040
♫  I restlessly follow your voice  ♫

265
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,380
♫  Even if you ask me a thousand times, it's you  ♫

266
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,400
 Give it here. 
♫  The one who saved me  ♫

267
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,060
 Is this a bit small? 

268
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,080
I

269
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,390
will not share a room.

270
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,740
Until the direction of your family and the authority of the Do Dang is decided,
 (Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeon)] 

271
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,050
I have no thoughts of bearing your child.

272
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,840
They will do their best for your family and your success,

273
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,640
but if something goes wrong for the Min family of Hwang Ryeo they will abandon me.

274
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,300
I know that you are surprised by my words—

275
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,970
Then, sleep.

276
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,610
I will sleep on that side.

277
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,850
Look here.

278
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,800
There's no use in saying that.

279
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,280
I understood what you said.

280
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,950
I will work hard so that you will not be abandoned by the Min Family of Hwang Ryeo.

281
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,900
You can sleep two feet away on that side.

282
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,080
You have raised your daughter preciously.

283
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,640
I am sorry that a wedding happened in this way.

284
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,810
What is there for you to apologize for, General?

285
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:10,140
This marriage was chosen by the Hwang Ryeo Min Family and was also my daughter's choice.
 (Min Je: Haedong Gapjok's Leader, nicknamed: Yeo Eun) 

286
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,420
Ah.

287
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,550
In the future, please help us a lot, In-law.

288
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,460
Yes.

289
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,130
Whether it is General Lee Seong Gye or I, we still lack power in the Do Dang.

290
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,790
So if the Haedong Gapjok will give us support,
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

291
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,650
we can work on a better Goryeo. Please help us.

292
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,380
Please help us, In-law.

293
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,620
We only proceeded with a marriage.

294
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,910
What do we know about politics?

295
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,660
The politics should be handled by you, Po Eun and General.

296
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,930
Have you met with General Lee Seong Gye?

297
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,020
What did he say?

298
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,390
He asked for help.

299
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,970
Are you going to help him?

300
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,160
If I help him all of Haedong Gapjok will help him too.

301
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,050
If he accepts our support, he needs to be qualified.

302
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,310
He needs to personally have the qualifications.

303
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,600
Now, the members of the Do Dang cannot treat you roughly, General.

304
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,500
I'm saying that because you're now in-laws with the Haedong Gapjok.

305
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,000
That man, Min Je, never called me his in-law even once.

306
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,010
The meaning of this marriage has been defined.

307
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,590
Their decision depends on our future actions.

308
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,410
 Lee Bang Ji 

309
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,480
How...

310
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,750
 In any battle with a swordsman's speed, even after cutting a person, blood won't get on the sword. 

311
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,980
How is it that I have become faster?

312
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,820
 The more you fight, the stronger you become. 

313
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,980
 When you fight a strong person, you will become as strong as that man. 

314
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,000
 Could it be... 

315
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,720
 That's right. 

316
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,280
 So that's what it is. 

317
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,070
 He's really good. 

318
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,060
I'm sorry for disturbing you in the middle of training.

319
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,840
For my lady Boon Yi, I'm thinking of giving you some sincere advice.

320
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,570
The lady said that I am Goryeo's hope.

321
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,360
 Warrior-nim, you are Goryeo's hope. 

322
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,140
The reason for that is because I am ordinary, but you are...

323
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,060
I'm going to ask you a favor.

324
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,940
A favor?

325
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,140
Go to Won Hyeong Village in the South and give this letter to a girl called Gab Boon.

326
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,190
- Please take care of my belongings too.
- Ah, yes. Well, it's not even a difficult job.

327
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,390
Thank you.

328
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,590
Ah, no worries.

329
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,910
They say that the battle of pride between men is really important during the first meeting.

330
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,950
Hey! You, Viper! I will catch up and overtake you!

331
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,040
As a swordsman, I have ambitions too!

332
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,760
I ought to...

333
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,200
Aish...

334
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,370
He's safe, right?

335
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,080
He's in the same training camp with me in General Lee Seong Gye's Ga Byeol Cho.

336
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,870
Ah, he also met his younger sister!

337
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,400
Younger sister?

338
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,310
Yes. He met his younger sister and General Lee Seong Gye gave him a name.

339
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,540
Anyway, everything went well.

340
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,260
It's written there too, not to worry about him.

341
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,950
It just seems like words to comfort me...

342
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,080
They're not.

343
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,780
If you go to the Ga Byeol Cho's training camp, you can meet him.

344
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,270
 Gab Boon 

345
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,530
Then, that's great.

346
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,960
 It's the Viper's clothes! 

347
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,290
Clothes really make a warrior, eh?

348
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,990
It's cool! The pose is cool.

349
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,620
Ah, Moo Hyul, you're cool!

350
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,730
Stop!

351
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,110
Hey, hey!

352
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,150
It's not?

353
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,650
 G-Gil Tae Mi? 

354
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,970
You're tall. You're not him!

355
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,430
Why are you going around wearing clothes like this?

356
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,380
 He's really the best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms. 

357
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,000
- Hey!
- Yes?

358
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,040
Why are you wearing that?

359
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,500
Just because.

360
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,050
Is this also a trend?

361
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,460
By the way, are you Hong Dae Hong's student?

362
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,420
What?

363
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,410
You have exactly that (his) sword skill.

364
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,460
No... How do you know that person?

365
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,330
That person?

366
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,190
Of course, I know him. He's my teacher.

367
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,530
 Damn it... It was real? 

368
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,820
His sword skills are lousy and he's a swindler by nature,

369
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,980
but he's the best teacher.

370
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,880
Work hard on learning. You have talent.

371
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,640
Excuse me!

372
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,420
If Hong Dae Hong is really your teacher,

373
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,140
why don't people know that fact?

374
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,630
It's embarrassing!

375
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,820
What?

376
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,020
That person is still going around cheating people, right?

377
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,360
Also, the name of his swordsmanship.

378
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Twin Dragons of the East. What the hell is Twin Dragons of the East?

379
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,260
- What is it?
- Why didn't you tell me before?

380
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,270
Why didn't you tell me before?

381
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,760
That's right. I ate it.

382
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,840
I stole your chicken leg and ate it. Aiyoo, cheap bastard.

383
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,230
Just because of one chicken leg, you grab your teacher by the collar?
 (Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master) 

384
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,020
I will give it back.

385
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:24,220
Gil Tae Mi, Gil Sun Mi, Hong Ryun... Did you really train those three swordsmen?

386
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,000
For real?

387
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,340
Why didn't you tell me that beforehand?

388
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,670
Why are you saying I didn't tell you?

389
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,630
I also told you about it earlier, when we were eating,

390
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:40,350
even when I went to the bathroom, I told you everything! I said I trained them!

391
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,020
Teacher! Student Moo Hyul will learn all of the 24 moves of the Twin Dragons of the East.

392
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,270
Please forgive my rudeness from before and teach me!

393
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,250
Moo Hyul yes I did teach you.

394
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,860
You've learned up to the twentieth since you learn so fast.

395
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,290
Please teach me the other four, Teacher,

396
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,660
so that I can beat Gil Tae Mi and make my name known everywhere.

397
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,940
 - Something is unusual on the Hong In Bang side.
- What do you mean by unusual?
- Now they are taking the people's land. 

398
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,070
They are also confiscating land from the owners without any explanation.

399
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,290
Aren't they trying to make their soldiers and group bigger

400
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,890
because they failed at making a union with the Haedong Gapjok?

401
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,380
That is not the only thing.On the first day that Hong In Bang became the leader,

402
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:39,350
he personally called in the soldiers that tortured him in the year 1375 and harassed them.

403
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,310
Hong In Bang is going over the line.

404
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,250
Yes, he is out of his mind because of all the power he has.

405
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,530
 No. Something is strange about this. 

406
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,730
Bae Joo (Name of different places)

407
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,210
How did you know?

408
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:05,490
Elder! This is the land of Haedong Gapjok. If you touch this land then...

409
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,680
What if I take it over? What about it?

410
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,080
Haedong Gapjok! Haedong Gapjok!

411
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,310
What  are they really?

412
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,130
Lee Gwang!

413
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,880
Yes, Master!

414
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,280
Whose land is this?

415
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,300
Haedong Gapjok...

416
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,720
Now it is your land!

417
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,340
Go and tell the owner of this land!

418
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,700
If they rebel show them who is boss!

419
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,310
Yes! I understand.

420
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,180
What are you guys doing here?

421
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,630
This place! Since today it became elder Hong In Bang's land.

422
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,160
We are going to use this land well for the country so just know it that way.

423
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,910
I have never seen such bastards like you guys!

424
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,910
This land has been passed down in the Jo family for more than 700 years.

425
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:25,220
How can you try to defraud someone like this? Get lost!

426
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,070
Gosh. This guy.

427
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,090
- Hey you bastard—
I have already told you!

428
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,430
This is now Hong In Bang's land.

429
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,690
Why are you talking so much for an old man.

430
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,410
You bastard!

431
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:48,030
This guy has to learn a lesson!

432
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,890
Elder! Elder!

433
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,690
What do you mean an impeachment request?

434
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,690
Who dared to send a request to impeach Hong In Bang?

435
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,710
Elder Jo was attacked by the servants of Hong In Bang.

436
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,490
But isn't that only their one-sided view?

437
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,250
Why would Hong do that?

438
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,410
 No way. Did my in-law really go that far? 

439
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,150
That is what I mean! Why would he do that when he has everything he needs.

440
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,590
We have already sent officers to Bae Joo to investigate.

441
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,990
We will find out when we bring in elder Jo.

442
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,770
Then in three days, in this place,

443
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:40,650
we will hear Elder Jo's testimony. And if that turns out to be true,

444
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,510
then the impeachment of Hong In Bang will

445
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:49,190
be discussed in the Do Dang. That's final.

446
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,510
 Impeachment voting? 

447
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:01,230
Hong In Bang has put himself in danger. This will be our chance.

448
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,830
But even if we add teacher Po Eun's people and mine,

449
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,470
we only have 30 people and they have 60. Will the vote pass?

450
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,290
In normal circumstances that would be right.

451
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:16,130
However this time, even Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's people will have hard time deciding.

452
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,450
There is no one who wants to make Haedong Gapjok their enemy.

453
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,850
Therefore, if we get  rebellion  votes

454
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,390
we might have a chance.

455
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,470
Where did he go?

456
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,530
He went down to Bae Joo.

457
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:36,570
If it's Bae Joo, isn't that where Elder Jo lives? Why did he go down there?

458
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,190
Then send someone there.  We have to quickly find a solution.

459
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,010
Yes.

460
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:47,190
Will there be  rebellion  votes against Hong?

461
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:52,610
The black rocks are Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's people, and this white rock is our people.

462
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,930
It's 60 to 30.

463
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,430
If it was the usual situation it would end like this.

464
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:04,970
But many of Hong In Bang's people are feeling the burden of this situation.

465
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,770
Therefore, if we can get 16 votes from them...

466
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,370
Will there be 16 people who will agree to his impeachment?

467
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:27,770
There are 16 people who will definitely agree with us.

468
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,510
Sixteen people? How come?

469
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,410
Among them, eight are in-laws of the Haedong Gapjok families.

470
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,870
They can never cast a negative vote.

471
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:45,550
Also five of them are traders or sellers

472
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,270
who are connected to the Haedong Gapjok.

473
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:53,490
It will also be hard for them to reject the vote.

474
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:57,970
Yes, these 13 people will definitely agree on the vote.

475
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:07,530
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

476
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,410
The problem is these three.

477
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,410
If we can convince these three people...

478
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,010
It's the end of Hong In Bang.

479
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:35,770
If the remaining three change their mind my in-law is done for?

480
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,550
That's right.

481
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:42,750
And the other 13 have no choice because they are all related to the Haedong Gapjok in some way?

482
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:47,830
Yes. It's too much of a burden to tell the 13 to reject the vote.

483
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:52,870
So we have to make sure the other 3 do not fall in to their side.

484
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,770
Fine. Then let's all go keep our eyes on them.

485
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,950
You will have to do something big.

486
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,350
Can I really do that?

487
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:09,210
What are you scared of when you have me behind you?

488
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,290
However, Teacher. Something seems weird to me.

489
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,690
What is it?

490
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,210
No matter what, to me

491
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:24,010
it does not look like Hong In Bang put himself in danger because he went crazy with power.

492
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,990
During my childhood

493
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,370
Hong In Bang continuously bothered me.

494
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,070
What do you really want to say?

495
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:41,570
When he would harass me, here was one thing he would say that I hated the most.

496
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,450
What is that?

497
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:48,390
"You are very similar to me."

498
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,510
That is something very annoying to hear.  How can he say...

499
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,850
Up to a certain point, he is right.

500
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,650
So?

501
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:04,890
So, for a moment I thought about this from Hong In Bang's point of view.

502
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:12,790
Why? Why did he go over the line when he has all the power?

503
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,050
Did the fact the he is a traitor lower his self-esteem?

504
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:22,710
And did the rejection his marriage proposal by the Haedong Gapjok help lower his self-esteem?

505
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:30,330
I really hate that guy, but  if I am really like him, as he said,

506
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:37,090
he is not simply going crazy because of the sweet power he just recently acquired.

507
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,110
Nor is he overly conceited.

508
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,750
Then what is it?

509
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,030
I do not know.

510
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:50,330
But it seems like Hong In Bang has a plan with a different intention.

511
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:04,370
As you know Hong In Bang, I too know him as well.

512
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,310
The moment he became a traitor, he had nowhere to go but to gain power.

513
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:16,370
I believe there is a higher chance that he was blinded by the power.

514
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,270
Think about when he took down Lee In Gyeom.

515
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:23,630
Lee In Gyeom was Hong In Bang's shield, but

516
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:30,270
just because he wanted to gain all the power, he held hands with us and took out Lee In Gyeom.

517
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,270
That was his big mistake.

518
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:40,870
Also, like you said, even if this is his plan, it is also his mistake.

519
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,880
Attacking Haedong Gapjok is a totally different story.

520
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,120
We have to quickly pick on Hong In Bang's mistake and go in.

521
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,790
This is a battle for time.

522
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,520
Elder, I did as you ordered.

523
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,010
Right!

524
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:06,290
Now go to my other house in Bae Joo and stay there.

525
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,930
Yes.

526
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,600
Just what bastards would do this thing?

527
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:26,220
How can they treat another family's Shin Joo Dan Ji like this?
 (Shin Joo Dan Ji: a jar believed to contain the souls of ancestors.) 

528
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,880
Hong In Bang. It was done by that Minister's servants.

529
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,610
Assemble all of our servants!

530
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:43,770
Everyone, are you really going to do it?

531
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,840
We also don't want to do this.

532
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:51,480
How can we approve of his impeachment in front of him?

533
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,830
We also do not want to have the Haedong Gapjok as our enemy.

534
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,020
Among the three of them, not even one person would agree.

535
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,170
Then, are we going to lose this chance?

536
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,980
We have secured 43 votes. We only need 3 more votes.

537
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,340
You said that we need 46 votes to secure the majority.

538
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,370
Damn...

539
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,980
This, Brother!

540
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,240
Are we both fools, Brother?

541
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,430
Why are you doing this?

542
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,830
I will cut off your heads and put them in front of your ancestors.

543
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,310
No.

544
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,480
This is not right!

545
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,800
Elder! Elder!

546
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,550
I will take a horse and go to Gaegyeong.

547
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:13,800
I will confess to the King that I killed this man

548
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,430
and let him know about Hong In Bang's brutality.

549
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,650
Just know that and make preparations!

550
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,490
Yes!

551
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,120
- Something's strange.
- What do you mean?

552
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,360
Five people from our side... Five people!

553
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,450
What about those five people?

554
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,370
Are they going to approve the impeachment?

555
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:47,200
Five of them have requested Chingbyeong Gwolseok.

556
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,220
 Chingbyeong Gwolseok: An excuse to not come because of illness 

557
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,270
What to do...

558
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:56,680
It's not just me, but they have all become unbelievable fools.

559
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,070
I also have nothing to say.

560
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,330
How can I think that only the 46 votes can make a majority?

561
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,900
That's what I'm saying.

562
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,780
Reducing the number of total voters would also reduce the majority vote requirement.

563
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,360
Five people of the Do Dang have abstained due to illness so 43 votes will get it approved.

564
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,080
It's done.

565
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,600
Like Sam Bong said, five people didn't come.

566
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,500
Now, we are the majority.

567
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,630
From here on, we will cast our votes regarding Minister Hong In Bang's impeachment.

568
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,710
The people who are not here won't be counted.

569
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,330
Stop!

570
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,730
Before the vote regarding my impeachment,

571
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:19,170
I have an emergency report to the members of the Do Dang.

572
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:25,730
 Teacher, this time, I think I got it right. 

573
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:35,020
Jo Ban... Jo Ban of the Jo Family of Bae Joo was involved in a conspiracy.

574
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:44,660
Just what are you saying? Conspiracy? Lord Jo Ban involved in a conspiracy?

575
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,050
That is just impossible!

576
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:52,710
Fortunately, my soldiers caught him and are now leading him to Gaegyeong.

577
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,480
 What is this document? Isn't this about you plotting a scheme? 

578
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,760
 Isn't that a document that you forged? 

579
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,460
 To kill me, you killed Lee Kwang. 

580
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,510
 Because I knew of your conspiracy, you wanted to kill me. 

581
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,710
 You, bastard! 

582
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,370
Because Jo Ban claimed that he had his land stolen by me,

583
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,590
I personally went to Bae Joo to check on the situation.

584
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:37,200
But ater going there, I realized that Jo Ban is plotting a conspiracy.

585
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,090
Jo Ban is planning to kill me.

586
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,700
I barely escaped.

587
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:56,530
To protect me, my servant Lee Kwang exchanged clothes with me and ran.

588
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:59,430
He was killed by Jo Ban.

589
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,270
Just what are you saying?

590
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:09,550
- Jo Ban plotted a conspiracy?
- I, who barely survived,

591
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,390
assembled soldiers and counterattacked.

592
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:18,290
Fortunately, I was able to suppress Jo Ban's scheme early.

593
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:21,360
Do you have any evidence that Jo Ban plotted a conspiracy?

594
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,390
Calm yourself down, General.

595
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,970
That is, if

596
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:29,180
you are not involved in this matter.

597
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,490
What?

598
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,600
This is the evidence.

599
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,720
On the fifth day of this month, please take up arms as promised.

600
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,370
Gather the troops at Dong Deok Gate at the hour if Mi (1-3pm).

601
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,660
We're going to the palace.

602
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:00,290
To whom could this letter be addressed to?

603
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,760
As you already know, Jo Ban

604
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,640
is part of the Haedong Gapjok.

605
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,700
 Then, is another Haedong Gapjok involved in this matter? 

606
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,820
Or is it someone who is allied with the Haedong Gapjok?

607
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,010
Whether there is another person or not,

608
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:30,320
there will be a thorough investigation and the rebels will be punished.

609
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:44,370
Teacher, you are wrong and I am right.

610
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:47,770
Hong In Bang fabricated the conspiracy case.

611
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:18,580
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

612
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,070
 Six Flying Dragons 

613
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,730
 I came to threaten you. 

614
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:28,000
 Gather the signatures of all the Haedong Gapjok in here. 

615
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,170
 It's because I raised a monster... 

616
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:35,230
 If the people of the Haedong Gapjok sign their names on the document by tonight, then it will be delivered to Hong In Bang tomorrow morning. 

617
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,040
 We don't have time. 

618
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,470
 Tonight, the direction of power will be decided. 

619
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,140
 Hey, Gil Tae Mi. Are you the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms? 

620
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,990
 - Battle it out.
- I will make more time so that those people won't give their signatures. 

621
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,900
 Immediately cut off their heads. Do you understand?
