 Episode 25 

3
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,430
Now, please have a seat on this side.

4
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,390
Thank you.

6
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,180
Hey, what are you doing?

7
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,240
You're making it obvious that you're a country man who came to Do Hwa Jeon for the first time.

8
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,190
My grandmother said that if you look around wide-eyed at places like this, you will look unsophisticated.

9
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,140
Hey, I said let's go.

10
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,990
Let's go.
 (Lee Bang Ji) 

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,300
When I blow on the whistle, we start right away.

12
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,260
Of course. Just do your job properly.

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,530
Aigoo. Earlier, you were talking about why we'd have to come here and stuff.

14
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,890
Yah it doesn't even taste good. I'm eating to be nice.

15
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,900
For something that doesn't taste good, you're eating too much of it.

16
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,310
Since it taste bad, I'm just eating a lot.

17
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,840
But why did you wear so much shiny stuff on your clothes?

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,230
Oh my gosh, it's what I wear every day.

19
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,740
He said it's his casual clothes.

20
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,760
Hey, smile a bit. We're in such a nice place.

21
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,400
I've only heard about it but Do Hwa Jeon is really nice. It's also your first time here, right?

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,630
I've been here.

23
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,850
What a joke. How can you enter this place?

24
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,580
Here! Have a drink,

25
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,720
because you guys are under General Lee Sung Gye.

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,880
As expected, you look like you're on a different level.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,200
Please have a glass of this alcohol as well.

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,900
I've seen everything.

29
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,120
Your battle with traitor Gil Tae Mi.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,230
Yes.

31
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,520
I was just wondering who this was, aren't you the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms?

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,540
My glass as well, please.

33
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,460
I respect you.

34
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,830
Ah, must be nice.

35
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,730
That's right.

36
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,050
I should've arranged this earlier.

37
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,100
Since we were all busy with our work, we just did not have the time to.

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,380
Still, we have succeeded in a historical revolt by withdrawing the troops,

39
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,510
so would it make sense to not have a celebration like this?

40
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,420
Yes. We thank you once again for preparing such an amazing banquet like this.

41
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,150
I will raise my glass.

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,990
Ah, yes.

43
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,350
Oh back then, when we attacked Soong-in gate,

44
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,510
this guy came running and said

45
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,720
General Lee Sung Gyae had already marched towards Soong-in gate.

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,460
So I was like, "What bullshit are you talking about when this is the Soong-in gate?"

47
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,890
Aish.

48
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:12,270
About that, Son-ui Gate and Soong-in Gate have similar pronunciations so I got confused.

49
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,840
Wouldn't it be the same for everyone?

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,200
This kid still probably

51
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,760
doesn't know which Gate he attacked.

52
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,880
I know!

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,730
Gate!

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,490
Where is the outhouse?

55
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,950
You just have to go in on that side.

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,460
Why do you look at me like that?

57
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,920
Are you looking for the outhouse?

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,600
The outhouse is that way.

59
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,950
 You shouldn't think of this lightly. 

60
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,410
 It's not that we're thinking of it lightly. 

61
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,620
We thought that we'd get land right away, but because that's not the case,
 (Gab Boon) 

62
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,750
everyone's just disappointed.

63
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,950
We cannot feel things like disappointment.

64
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,450
Why can't we?

65
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,190
You know Hong In Bang who stole our land, right?
 (Boon Yi) 

66
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,820
What about that bastard Hong?

67
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,460
That person, even when he had a lot, in order to get more, till the end he did not change his will.

68
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,880
There was no giving up with him.

69
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,880
That's why he's a bastard.
 (Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's Grandmother) 

70
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,090
Yes. He is a bastard to us,

71
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,170
but we are fighting with people who are like that.

72
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,480
From those kind of people, we are getting what's ours again.

73
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,770
It's definitely not easy. The person who give up first loses.

74
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,390
If you become disappointed first, then you lose.

75
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,150
Then, what should we do?

76
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,670
We need to have the desire to gain what's ours.

77
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,690
That's how we will have the will and we will make that into our power.

78
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,430
Please don't forget.

79
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,770
Because General Jo Min Soo doesn't want his land to be taken, he even assembled the army.

80
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,740
Would the other noble families be any different?

81
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,260
They are that kind of people.

82
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,940
So we also need to have will and power.

83
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,820
That's right. I agree with what Leader Boon Yi said.

84
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,950
If she says that disappointment is a luxury, then so be it.

85
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,680
If you feel disappointed, then you lose!

86
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,900
That's right!

87
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,210
That's right. Let's do this until the end!

88
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,730
Let's give it a try. Yes!

89
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,140
Eat and gain strength!

90
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,740
Did you know about this?

91
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,900
About the content of Jo Joon's petition to the king? And with Jeong Do Jeon's 10-million square meters plan he separated us.

92
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,840
If not, then what about Jo Min Soo and Lee Sung Gye being on good terms?

93
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,830
Whatever it is, did you know about it?

94
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,170
Does it matter whether I knew about it beforehand?
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

95
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,780
The contents of the appeal that Jo Joon and Sam Bong raised.

96
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,580
There is no difference to the idea we Sadaebu have had for the past 40 years.

97
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,280
Whether Sam Bong does it or I do it, what's the difference?

98
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,320
It's different.

99
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,650
Teacher.

100
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,570
Who leads the reformation is the most important thing, and

101
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,670
the results will also differ according to that.

102
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:22,310
If it were a reformation that you were going to do, then I would have supported it no matter what.

103
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,650
But Sam Bong's plan is different.

104
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:34,880
Teacher, how can you make that judgment only to Sam Bong?

105
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,540
Sambong's idea was always immoral.

106
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,180
Sam Bong does not believe in the ways of nature.

107
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,200
He's someone who disobey's the heavens.

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
Teacher.

109
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,710
If you keep on being stubborn like that, in the end,

110
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,020
you will have no choice but to stand on the opposite side of the reformation of this country.

111
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,450
Are you still going to be like that?

112
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,210
'Eighteen sons become the king'.'It was such a cheap strategy.

113
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,390
What angers me more is that, because of your cheap strategy, all the Sadaebu has been divided.

114
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,220
Right now, when everyone has to have the same goal and proceed with the reformation.

115
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,230
Same goal.

116
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,600
Do you really believe that there is such a thing as the same goal?
 (Ha Ryun) 

117
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,250
Even during my Seonggyungwan days, I have always been curious.

118
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,110
Why can't Brother Po Eun understand the people's conflict?

119
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,810
Why does Po Eun always say that people need to work in harmony?

120
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,550
Originally, people can't do that.

121
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,770
Everyone has different goals from one another.

122
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,470
Do you not believe in the Confucius doctrines?

123
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:22,710
Uh... Brother, politics can be only done by with disbelief at it's base.

124
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,790
Brother Sam Bong is probably thinking the same thing.

125
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,140
Where in the world is there politics being made by believing others.

126
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,160
Then, why do we need laws?

127
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,030
That is not a Confucianism right but the right of the law.

128
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,750
Also, Sam Bong is clearly a Confucian scholar.

129
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,250
Like me, Sam Bong believes in a person's nature,

130
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,210
and we are trying to reform Goryeo with trust as it's base.

131
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,930
Are you not seeing it

132
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,450
or are you unable to see it?

133
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,120
Sam Bong might even be planning

134
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,300
to put Lee Seong Gye on the throne.

135
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,150
Look here!

136
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,690
Should we bet on it?

137
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,740
Should we make a bet?

138
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,960
We cannot make a country that we want like this.

139
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,710
My desire to proceed with the land reform right away is still the same.

140
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,820
But because you said for that dream we have to first separate them,

141
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,240
I agreed with confiscating people's land if they had more than 10-million square meters of expropriated land.

142
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,700
But now that we're here,

143
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,520
You set aside the reformation and are negotiating with Jo Min Soo?

144
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,710
So right now at Do Hwa Jeon are they sharing drinks with Jo Min Soo?

145
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,530
Look here, Woo Jae (Jo Joon's nickname).

146
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,750
Like this, 10-million square meters won't be enough.

147
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,380
Will it be 50-million square meters or 100-million square meters?

148
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,480
So do you want to spill blood on the Royal Court again?

149
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,460
Revolution is about spilling blood anyway.

150
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,720
If we can avoid it, we should avoid it.

151
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,640
Are you saying that while knowing how difficult that path is?

152
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,240
I know. Of course, I do!

153
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,070
But, I am a Confucian scholar no matter what!

154
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,010
I want to do everything, whether it's the method or the result, in a Confucian way.

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,170
Ha Ryun?

158
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,390
Yes. He said he wants to meet you.

159
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,350
Does the food match your taste?

160
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,800
Thank you for treating us so abundantly.

161
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,190
If you think about all the contributions you have made to this country, this is nothing.

162
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,790
Yes.

163
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:02,390
Here! Just for today, let's all try to get drunk!

164
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,090
That's right!

165
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,750
 The signal is when I break a cup.
(Jo Min Soo) 

166
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,330
 When I break a cup, blow the whistle and let everyone know. 

167
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,780
 Yes, my Lord. 

168
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:25,730
 When the signal is given, you are in charge of commanding the soldiers and attacking them. 

169
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,140
 You must not make any mistakes. 

170
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,360
 Yes, don't worry. 

171
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,620
 Have you prepared everything that I ordered you to? 

172
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,550
 Yes. I have made preparations according to your orders. 

173
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,880
 But the opponent is Lee Seong Gye. Are we going to be okay? 

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,180
 I understand it now. 

175
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,080
 Anyhow, Lee Sung Gyae and I cannot work together. 

176
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,720
 That hand of reconcilement is also only for the moment. 

177
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,080
 When the people's minds are settled, he will definitely get rid of me, s. 

178
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,870
 I have no choice but attack first. 

179
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,120
Don't lie.

180
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,950
This is totally a lie. I...

181
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,880
When did I do that? That wasn't me. Back then I was only

182
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,540
slaying them forwards, sideways, and upwards.

183
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,810
What do you mean upwards, back then you were all scared and were crying so hard.

184
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,900
A man does not cry. No, I did not cry.

185
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,520
When did I cry?

186
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,210
W-W-What was that, that g-g-gate?

187
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,730
See you do not even know that. that is why I'm saying you do not remember things.

188
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,050
 As expected, best swordsman Lee Bang Ji is also present. 

189
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,840
 I was hoping he wouldn't come. 

190
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,490
 If our first plan fails, it will be a disaster.  

191
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,730
 You must not get your sword stolen. 

192
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,810
 Yes, my Lord. 

193
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,380
 Lee Seong Gye's eldest son, Lee Bang Woo, is also not an easy opponent. 

194
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,120
 You will be in charge of him. 

195
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,140
 I understand. 

196
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,560
 But in today's banquet, another guy came with them. 

197
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,660
 Since he is carrying a sword, it seems that he's a swordsman too. What should we do with him? 

198
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,390
 He must be just a Ga Byeol Cho guy. 

199
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,000
 Don't mind him. Lee Bang Ji. 

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,570
 Just pay attention to Lee Bang Ji. 

201
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,790
 If you cause any disturbance tonight 

202
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,110
 or you pick a fight after getting drunk, I will not tolerate it.
(Nam Eun) 

203
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,950
 Do you understand? 

204
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,290
So I was like, yeah, so I went and was like...

205
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,410
I know but...

206
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,490
Did you ask to see me?

207
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,680
Aigoo, welcome. Have a seat.

208
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,020
Please give us a bowl of rice soup and a bottle of alcohol.

209
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,500
Yes.

210
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,750
Please give us rice soup here too.

211
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,180
I'm hungry, also give us rice wine.

212
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,220
Serve us with warm ones.

213
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,020
Thank you. Take care. Aigoo, what can I get you?

214
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,220
I heard that you said that if you feel disappointed, then you lose.

215
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,560
After I heard about that, I understood how much of a disappointment this is.

216
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,760
Trust me. I'm quick-tempered.

217
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,320
Those kinds of people also have a driving force.

218
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,040
Just sit and watch. I'm going to  bother Teacher and Father so much that I'm going to make them do it.

219
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,240
You don't believe me?

220
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,110
Here. Proof of my promise.

221
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,290
If I don't keep my promise later on, hold on to this and find me.

222
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,810
If things go wrong, I'd have to take this and find you

223
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,730
and tell you to spit the bug out.

224
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,820
I will be busy.

225
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,140
Are you not going to do this properly?

226
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,710
You should tell the bug to spit me out. Not the other way around.

227
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,710
Ah, was that it?

228
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,390
Can I leave you to it when I feel so uneasy?

229
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,850
About Unni Yeon Hee.

230
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,410
She and my brother liked each other.

231
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,150
If only the Do Dang Triumvirate hadn't taken our land,

232
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,340
Unni and Brother wouldn't have had to leave our hometown.

233
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,440
So there was a story like that.

234
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,100
If it had been like that, then they wouldn't have to be suffering like this.

235
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,220
It's the same for me.

236
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,060
A lot of things happened, but in the end it's all about the land.

237
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,140
But after hearing that the land reform might happen,

238
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,000
for the first time, Unni Yeon Hee

239
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,080
told me to go back to our hometown together.

240
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,580
My brother

241
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,530
was so happy after hearing that.

242
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,150
That's what I'm disappointed about.

243
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,070
I think that my brother and Unni have to live happily

244
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,960
for me to be happy as well.

245
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,270
I don't think that's it.

246
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,970
Nobody.

247
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,670
Nobody can put another person's life on their back, in any situation.

248
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,030
Even between parent and child, even among siblings.

249
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,810
Is that so?

250
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,290
It must be right.

251
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,280
But I want to do that. I'm that kind of person.

252
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,860
The charm of being a schemer?

253
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,340
Yes. This is the beauty of being  a schemer.

254
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,420
Don't you already know?

255
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,330
This feeling of putting powerful people in the palm of my hands and controlling them as I want.

256
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,230
Isn't this a charm?

257
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,250
Why are you laughing? It's probably the same for you.

258
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,550
- Me?
- Yes!

259
00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:00,190
You have the Goryeo's hero General Lee Sung Gye in the palm of your hands.

260
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,670
People probably say it's not like that,  but

261
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,230
I know.

262
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,250
What?

263
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Are you saying that Jo Min Soo is in the palm of your hand?

264
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,060
Yes. Isn't he?

265
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,250
You are such a clumsy schemer.

266
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,680
In what way?

267
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,810
Whatever faction or power,

268
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,780
even if that is a country,

269
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,610
you can read the tendency and the situation.

270
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,350
- And sometimes you can control that.
-Then?
- Only that does not happen to people.

271
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:50,400
Reading a person is harder than reading a single country. What did you say?

272
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,630
What did you say I did to General Lee Seong Gye?

273
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:03,900
There were a few times when I haven't properly read General Lee Seong Gye.

274
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:13,250
It's not only the General, when Hong In Bang was trying to put Jo Ban as the rebel, I could not read him so I had hard times.

275
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:19,390
And I also saw a big plan being swayed because of one action of a young man.

276
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,740
Sometimes there are indeed those kings of troublemakers.

277
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,070
No.

278
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,630
Actually, people are all troublemakers.

279
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,360
The only difference is whether that is worked out or not.

280
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,690
What is it that you want to say?

281
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:41,520
A schemer at least has to be humble in front of people.

282
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,570
Did you say that Jo Min Soo is in the palm of your hands?

283
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,100
All you found and gained was only the relationship of understanding and the status of Jo Min Soo's  party.

284
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,950
I told General Jo, if he acts like he is preparing an army then Lee Sung Gye will try to negotiate.

285
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:08,550
Then first, reconcile with him. I gave him that advice.

286
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,010
What happened?

287
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,150
Jo Min Soo did as exactly as I said.

288
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,060
If this doesn't mean that he's in the palm of my hands, then what is it?

289
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:26,150
On top of that, he even said he will open a party as well.

290
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,700
Didn't you instruct him to open a banquet?

291
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,850
Why would I?

292
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,810
 We've been invited to Do Hwa Jeon. 

293
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:43,440
 Banquet? It seems that Jo Min Soo is feeling rushed.
(Lee Bang Woo) 

294
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,870
 He is the type of person who says those things do not match him and he hates it. 

295
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:54,080
If he only acts like he is preparing an army, General Lee, who is scared of the public sentiment, will come and surrender on his own.

296
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,980
Why would there be a reason to open a party  and show them what he is thinking beforehand.

297
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,100
If it was me, I wouldn't do that.

298
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,340
Have you heard of an alcohol with cinnamon?

299
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,740
I have heard of it but have never tried it.

300
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,530
Oh, this. I would give you a taste immediately.

301
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,080
Please just wait for a bit.

302
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,230
It's ready.

303
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,300
Put in the rest as well and serve the drinks.

304
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,210
Yes, Elder.

305
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:09,510
Choon Wul that wench is the best. Even if you stay still she shows up in your eyes.

306
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,430
What are you saying?

307
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,670
Myung Wool is better than Choon Wool.

308
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,920
In my whole life, I've never seen a woman as flirty as Myung Wool.

309
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,930
She just keeps on whispering on my ear. Aigoo.

310
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,500
 How was that? 

311
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,660
Aigo let's drink until we are out of our minds.

312
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,650
 Since today is a good day  

313
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,400
 let's all drink together. Drink. 

314
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,630
That's right. More, more!

315
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,910
Because he was wearing a hat, I couldn't see his face.

316
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:26,480
Did I faint after seeing him? I remembered the wheat field where the cruel thing happened.

317
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,750
 I'm sorry. 

318
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,760
 No, it's okay. 

319
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,140
 Lady-- 

320
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,650
On her butt, just!

321
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:03,190
 So that person is the one who did that horrible thing to Lady Yeon Hee. 

322
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,210
So the party is only his idea?

323
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,790
Yes.

324
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:15,020
He got really scared because even teacher Lee Saek turned his back on him.

325
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,450
I'm only saying this to you. General Jo Min Soo

326
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,480
said that he will give more than 10-million square meters of the land he illegally took.

327
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,830
How can he control the court when he fears so many things.

328
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,000
He will voluntarily  give up his land?

329
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,390
That's what I said.

330
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:43,360
This is all my doing.

331
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,510
This...

332
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,560
Why are you like that?

333
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:56,020
If giving up 10-million square meters is that easy to those people, is assembling the army necessary?

334
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,290
That's because I said that General Lee Seong Gye is...

335
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:06,090
I will ask you one thing. Did you come here to meet me of your own will?

336
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,330
Or was it a request from Jo Min Soo?

337
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,610
Luckily, since you said you and Jeon Do Jeong studied together,

338
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,470
 please have a good talk with him while I'm at the banquet. 

339
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,470
Jo Min Soo probably told you to meet me, right?

340
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,440
Why are you being like that?

341
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,630
If

342
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:06,310
you came here to meet me because Jo Min Soo asked you to, not of your own will, then you were used by him.

343
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,350
General.

344
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,350
Teacher Ha Ryun is with Sam Bong right now.

345
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,870
I assigned people to follow them.

346
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,930
Sam Bong.

347
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,780
I cannot let that wicked guy live.

348
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,600
I got used?

349
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,200
From your side the second table on the left side, the guy with the dark colored robe

350
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,910
keeps on looking at us and met my gaze three times now.

351
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,810
Did you bring him with you?

352
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,000
Probably not.

353
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,330
Aigo, my body feels tired.

354
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,610
Damn it.

355
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:05,330
If Jo Min Soo trusted you or honored you, he would have not done something like this by using you.

356
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:10,330
He did this because you did not give him more trust but only sold your ideas.

357
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,950
 How did that Jo Min Soo... 

358
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,020
Properly tell me what Jo Min Soo said.

359
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,520
He asked me to meet you while he's at the banquet.

360
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,830
and I heard about the 10-million square meters of land then.

361
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,110
He used you to take me out of the Ga Byeol Cho.

362
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,360
Those warriors followed you and now are after me. Why do you think that is?

363
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,320
Well, I'm not sure.

364
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,080
 You just have to pretend that you're assembling the army. 

365
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,260
 In my life, I have never pretended to do something. 

366
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,240
 If I'm told to do something, I really do it. 

367
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,530
Did that man, Jo Min Soo, really...

368
00:29:54,530 --> 00:30:00,380
What is Jo Min Soo going to do at the Do Hwa Jeon banquet?

369
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,750
Now everything seems to be clear.

370
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,150
I think you're right.

371
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,750
Ma'am!

372
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,960
Where is the outhouse?

373
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,430
Brother, you can just go all the way there.

374
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,850
I also need to go so come back right away.

375
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,220
Ah, why?

376
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,240
Use your words.

377
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,660
Please go back to the Ga Byeol Cho with Bang Ji.

378
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,930
What? Why?

379
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,320
Before we came here, Teacher Nam Eun told us

380
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,610
that we have to be extra careful for the great cause because this is about making peace.

381
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,750
He told us not to get drunk and pick a fight.

382
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,640
He did say that. So what?

383
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,060
Are you going to fight with someone?

384
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,900
No. It's not that.

385
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,760
Bang Ji is in a critical situation.

386
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,350
If anything goes wrong, it will be the end of the negotiations or whatever.

387
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,300
What are you saying? Why would Bang Ji?

388
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,090
It's urgent. I don't have time to explain.

389
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,170
If I ask him to go, he won't listen to me

390
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,960
so please tell him that something happened and take Bang Ji with you.

391
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,520
It's my wish, Hyung-nim.

392
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,620
Okay, I get it.

393
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,000
You must tell me what this is about later.

394
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Yes, Hyung-nim. Hurry.

395
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,220
Husband.

396
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,760
What happened?

397
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,070
Teacher Sam Bong is here.
 (Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeong) 

398
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,230
Are Bang Gwa and Nam Eun here?

399
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,660
They are at the Gaegyeong residence. Why are you looking for them?

400
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,410
It seems like Jo Min Soo has some ulterior motives.

401
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,210
General Lee Seong Gye is in danger. We must send the soldiers to Do Hwa Jeon.

402
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,860
What are you saying?

403
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,340
I wonder if the alcohol will taste any good while drinking with those people.

404
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,970
Even right now, I'm thinking whether negotiating with them is the right thing to do.

405
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,210
Didn't I tell you to not say such things?

406
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:21,220
Do you think the General feels any good going to come if we reconcile with them tonight?

407
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,650
There's a problem.

408
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,410
I think something bad is going to happen at Do Hwa Jeon right now.

409
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,810
What do you mean something bad?

410
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,320
I think General Jo Min Soo has plotted a trap to kill Father-in-law.

411
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,360
You must hurry and assemble the Ga Byeol Cho.

412
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,770
Bang Ji, we need to go first. It seems like something happened at the Ga Byeol Cho.

413
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,560
Hurry.

414
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,230
Where are you going? Sit down.

415
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,680
Here.

416
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,140
This sweet cinnamon wine is here!

417
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,520
Here. Have a drink for now.

418
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,770
This is precious so you should have a taste before you go.

419
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,750
Here.

420
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:39,410
This is that sweet cinnamon wine that the royal family of the old Song dynasty enjoyed drinking.

421
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,790
Hyung-nim, I've only heard about this,

422
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,090
but this is the first time I'm tasting this in my whole life.

423
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,040
The cinnamon wine is good, but

424
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,850
just continue the story you were telling. Stop talking about something else.

425
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,310
Ah, where was I?

426
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,440
Ah! Right.

427
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,170
About those people from the Western district that I beat up.

428
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,680
After that, I looked thoroughly.

429
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,420
Where could it be? Where could it be?

430
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:23,190
- Who?
- There was a girl I was eyeing.

431
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:31,580
She ran towards the buckwheat field, so to catch the wench I ran here and there

432
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,700
and I got her in the end.

433
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,270
Great!

434
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,330
I got her as she cried and trembled.

435
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:48,350
Gently, in the buckwheat field, I laid her down and...

436
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,570
Stop it!

437
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,890
Bastard!

438
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,770
For the comradeship of the withdrawing army,

439
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,580
For the peaceful days of Goryeo to come, let's have a toast!

440
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,430
Yes.

441
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,670
What's with the armor?

442
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,820
It's a trap!

443
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,480
Hey! Start it!

444
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,680
What was that sound?

445
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,590
You must not get your swords stolen!

446
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,200
Hyung-nim, please escape!

447
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,790
Jo Min Soo, you son of a--

448
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,110
That...

449
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,270
Don't move!

450
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,290
Get away from Father!

451
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,170
I will cut this man's head off.

452
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,470
Jo Min Soo, you bastard! Are you thinking of assassinating me?

453
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,710
Aren't you planning to kill me anyway?

454
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm different from Choi Yeong. I'm not going to quietly wait for you to attack me.

455
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,920
It's that bastard. Kill him!

456
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,900
You don't have to be afraid!

457
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,300
He's just big but he's nothing.

458
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,710
While preparing for the banquet, Jo Min Soo's servants wore armor.

459
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:29,220
- Could it be that Jo Min Soo is...
- I will go and check on it.

460
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,070
Hurry up!

461
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,520
We don't have time.

462
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,800
Hurry and move!

463
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,260
Make haste!

464
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,170
It's ready.

465
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,800
What happened?

466
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,730
I came to deliver that person's will.

467
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,890
By that person's will, you mean...

468
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,360
Lee Bang Ji is holding a sword!

469
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,020
He got a sword.

470
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,080
That guy hurt his leg. Don't be scared. Attack!

471
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,630
Moo Hyul!

472
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,130
Moo Hyul! Go in and save the General!

473
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,030
Yes.

474
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,210
Let's live

475
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,080
and go back.

476
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,470
Lee Seong Gye, you will die here in Do Hwa Jeon anyway.

477
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,920
Attack Lee Seong Gye!

478
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,100
Then, this bastard's head will also fly off!

479
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,350
Bang Won!

480
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,500
Don't move!

481
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,320
I will cut your head off right away.

482
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,770
We need to get out of here.

483
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,110
Hurry and help your uncle!

484
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,360
Don't move!

485
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,100
Get him!

486
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,440
Warrior Moo Hyul!

487
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,910
Let's live and go back!

488
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:28,020
You should attack. Go!

489
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,950
Kill them!

490
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,000
- Bang Won!
- Hyung-nim!

491
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,950
Let's hurry and go out. Hurry!

492
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,960
Father!

493
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,560
Lee Seong Gye!

494
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,730
You will never make it out of Do Hwa Jeon!

495
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,730
If you want to keep your lives, throw away your weapons.

496
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:18,930
Jo Min Soo, you bastard! Aren't you thinking of killing all of us anyway?

497
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:21,870
Don't waver, everyone!

498
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,160
Yes. Let us all charge at them.

499
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,910
A person dies. What can we do about that?

500
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:37,680
I will surely take that bastard's head off.

501
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,730
Not yet. Wait.

502
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,750
Wait for what, Young Master?

503
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:52,900
When I count to three, all archers fire at once.

504
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,970
One!

505
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:04,660
Jo Min Soo... I shouldn't have trusted you for even a little bit.

506
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,590
Two!

507
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,350
Father!

508
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,290
Are you okay?

509
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,760
Bang Gwa!

510
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,790
Hyung-nim.

511
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,840
Bang Gwa.

512
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,640
Jo Min Soo and his people, throw away your weapons!

513
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,890
Arrest everyone without leaving anyone behind!

514
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:57,930
We will slaughter anyone who resists!

515
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,820
That person has made a choice.

516
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,080
Which one did he choose?

517
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,860
Lee Seong Gye?

518
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,100
Then, is it Jo Min Soo?
 (Jeok Ryeong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk) 

519
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:35,520
He said he will abandon both of them and see how luck turns out.

520
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,010
Since he has sent Pyeong Hae to Do Hwa Jeon,

521
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,440
there will be a result.

522
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,950
Ji Ran, endure it.

523
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,590
Of course.

524
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:08,790
This is nothing. Brother...

525
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:15,640
Didn't I get hit even more than this during the Battle of  Hwang Mountain?

526
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,640
Hey, you should also get treated.

527
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,900
Hey!

528
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,440
 He's not here. 

529
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,260
 Ddang Sae! 

530
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,380
 Hurry and go! Go! 

531
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,660
 Ddang Sae! Ddang Sae! 

532
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,040
Aish!

533
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,360
It's that bastard.

534
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,850
Brother!

535
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,980
 Don't worry. Don't worry. 

536
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,460
 If you stay still, I won't kill you. 

537
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,290
 Ddang Sae! Ddang Sae! 

538
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,200
Yeon Hee!

539
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,150
Unni! You must kill that bastard!

540
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,240
Move! Move!

541
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,890
Move!

542
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,580
Do you remember? In the buckwheat field.

543
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,700
Look at me! Do you remember?

544
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,340
The turbulent times are a weak person's hell.

545
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,300
Go to hell.

546
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,600
It's okay.

547
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,000
It's over.

548
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,680
♫  I guess I can't anymore  ♫

549
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,600
♫  I can't see you anymore  ♫

550
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,260
I'm sorry.

551
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,820
♫  I cannot say that name  ♫

552
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:54,710
♫  so I bury it in my heart  ♫

553
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,850
Unni.

554
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:03,380
♫  Because you fill me up  ♫

555
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:10,230
♫  and because I cannot endure you  ♫

556
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:23,350
♫  only the tears that resemble you flow  ♫

557
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:31,150
♫  Because it's stained in my breath 
 Because it's engraved in my body  ♫

558
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:38,110
♫  The more I try to forget, the more it hurts  ♫

559
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:44,910
♫  In my frozen heart that seems to have stopped  ♫

560
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:52,390
♫  time that is you is flowing  ♫

 Six Flying Dragons 

563
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,980
 I don't know how long it has been since I slept as well as last night. 

564
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,900
 The assassin who came out in the end, among the corpses,  

565
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,150
 who is it? 

566
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,850
 I also don't know that person.  

567
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,850
 An assassination plot? It's not me! 

568
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,060
 There's an organization. 

569
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,680
 That organization has a special pattern. 

570
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,640
 Pattern. 

571
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,520
 Deliver this. 

572
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,100
 Was it really a trap? 

573
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,710
 It's a counterattack. A very fatal one. 

574
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,450
 What will happen on this night?
