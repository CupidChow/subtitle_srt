3
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,310
 The Heavens never change
  

4
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,150
 so how come Po Eun changed? 

5
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,290
 Even though we are the ones who plan for domination, we are still lost in our thoughts. 

6
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,670
 Ruthless domination... 

7
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,420
 Po Eun, on the other hand... Even though he was trying to stop this domination, 

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,810
 he already knew about all of that. 

9
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,080
 Father. 

10
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,150
The General fell off his horse?
 (Jeong Do Jeon's place of exile) 

11
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,270
That's not all.

12
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,520
Lord Po Eun sent all of General's followers into exile, including Lord Jo Joon and Lord Nam Eun.

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,860
P-Po Eun did?

14
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,740
And so?

15
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,330
Bang Won hurriedly went to Byeokrando to escort General back.

16
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,050
There's no one to lead us in Gaegyeong right now.

17
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,350
If you want, I will get you out.

18
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,030
There are only a few soldiers outside.

19
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,030
If we wanted, from the beginning we could've just gathered forces and attacked the royal palace to claim the throne.

20
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,370
Did you say that true power is only the sword?

21
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,570
But this is definitely not fake power.

22
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:27,120
It's because justification and great cause can become power that people trust and follow.

23
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,320
Now, it depends on Heaven's will.

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,170
First is General's life and death situation.

25
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,910
Second, will Bang Won be able to escort him back to Gaegyeong as soon as possible?

26
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,050
 Criminal Jeong Do Jeon, accept the royal command! 

27
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,310
It is an order for criminal Jeong Do Jeon to be transferred to Gaegyeong.

28
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,760
Calm down and put your sword down. It only said to transfer him.

29
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,180
They won't be able to get off of this mountain with an injured man.

30
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,950
We have to find them!

31
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,970
Let's go.

32
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,920
Why is the palanquin like this?

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,420
Someone appeared and made it like this an instant before leaving.

34
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,620
What?

35
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,730
Young Master Bang Won was right.

36
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,140
If we hadn't done this, General might have died.

37
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,570
We also got attacked.

38
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,950
Those bastard who were targeting General will be searching the mountain.

39
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,170
We should also hurry and find General and Young Master Bang Won.

40
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,570
Everyone, disperse and find General and Bang Won!

41
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,230
Yes!

42
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,610
 Thank you, Warrior-nim. 

43
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,950
 I will escort you. 

44
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,970
 You don't have to. 

45
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,230
What are you doing there?

46
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,440
Can't you figure it out just by looking?

47
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,950
I was pulling up the cart again after dropping it down the slope.

48
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,650
Who are you and where are you from?

49
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,170
I'm a farmer from the village at the foot of the mountain.

50
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,610
You don't look like a farmer.

51
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,460
Pardon?

52
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,670
The criminal, Jeong Do Jeon, and his followers are being transferred to Gaegyeong.

53
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,330
Now, if Rang comes back after safely completing her task,
 (King Gong Yang, the last king of Goryeo) 

54
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,750
proceed with the execution according to this royal command.

55
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,070
Yes, Your Highness.

56
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,700
Being agile in one's duty, and knowing to spare one's words,

57
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,060
I think I've learnedâ€”

58
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,980
Who are you?

59
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,520
Please help me.

60
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,610
How did this happen?

61
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,690
Actually, we're being chased by our landlord's soldiers.

62
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,310
For what crime?

63
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,950
I wasn't able to pay tax because I was taking care of my sick father.

64
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,710
I will be back with some medicine.

65
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Are there some people hiding in here?

66
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,020
Pardon?

67
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,960
They are a father and a son.

68
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,180
Why would there be people like that at this time of the night?

69
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,240
May we have a look?

70
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,900
I already said that no one came here so why are you going to search?

71
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,680
I already said they're not here.

72
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,370
Nothing.

73
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,890
Let's go.

74
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,700
Excuse us.

75
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,820
Just where did they go?

76
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,570
Let's look again. Even if he's Lee Seong Gye, he won't be able to get away.

77
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,540
You can come out now.

78
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,730
Thank you.

79
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,240
What are you doing?

80
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,480
Do you think I don't know anything because I'm a Confucian scholar from the rural countryside?

81
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:10,180
I am from the Jo family of Yangjoo, and my teacher is one of Teacher Po Eun's scholars.

82
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,420
As someone who respects Teacher Lee Saek, do you think I wouldn't know Lee Seong Gye who sent him to exile?

83
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,120
Do you think I wouldn't know of the plans to ruin Goryeo's Confucianism with the rebellious Sam Bong?

84
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,010
Your plans to start another period of military regime in Goryeo's history,

85
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,980
do you think that I didn't know that?

86
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,160
Are you crazy?

87
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,480
No. It's just funny.

88
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,540
What?

89
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,700
Think about it.

90
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,240
A person who has been on a horse all his life, as he went to war,

91
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,140
has fallen off his horse.

92
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,000
Being chased by Lord Po Eun, who's always been old-fashioned all his life.

93
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,920
And now, by some countryside scholar who no one's ever heard of,

94
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,800
his life is being threatened.

95
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:33,160
Father really has an interesting fate even in his end.

96
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,250
Kill him.

97
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,310
What?

98
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:45,110
If you have the nerve to kill a hero of Goryeo who has spent all his life serving the country,

99
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,450
and have firm faith and belief in Lords Lee Saek and Po Eun, then kill him!

100
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,640
I will go to Ham Joo right away.

101
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,650
I will then bring the Ga Byeol Cho and kill you.

102
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,530
I don't even have to know your name.

103
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,830
I can just kill all the Jo family of Yang Joo.

104
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,800
Your second and even third generation. All of them!

105
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,610
Your respected Teacher Lee Saek?

106
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,820
Why do you respect him anyway?

107
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,260
He's against the land reform. He's also against the reform of Buddhism!

108
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,240
So why are you following Lee Saek?

109
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,650
The country that Father is going to establish

110
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,350
is not a military regime.

111
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,340
The country that Father is going to establish

112
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,060
is a Confucian country.

113
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,220
If it weren't for that,

114
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,590
why else would he go so far as to do the land reform and the Buddhist temple reform

115
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,140
despite all the opposition from Gwon Moon Sae Jeok .

116
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,610
You... You! You said you're a Confucian scholar.

117
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,230
We

118
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,950
- are going to make a Confucian country.
- I'll follow you.

119
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,050
- What?
- I'll follow you.

120
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,640
I was just curious.

121
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,890
Everyone just talks a lot,

122
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,590
but they don't know what General Lee Seong Gye has been doing.

123
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,760
I wanted to know but you answered right away.

124
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,660
I think it would be good if you didn't do this.

125
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,980
You can get off of this mountain with my help, even with  people wandering around here.

126
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,590
What did you say? You failed?

127
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,960
Yes.

128
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,700
General Lee Seong Gye was not in the palanquin the army told us about.

129
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,140
He was not in the palanquin taken by General Lee Ji Ran either.

130
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,570
Then, where did he go?

131
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,370
The royal army stayed and searched around the mountain, but

132
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,350
they couldn't find him until now.

133
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,480
- You didn't meet with Bang Won?
- No.

134
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,920
I sent men to the path from Byeokrando to Gaegyeong but they didn't go through there.

135
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,430
- Where do you think they went?
- At that time,

136
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,720
one of us should have followed Bang Won.

137
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,760
If we had, then those people wouldn't have been tricked the way Young Master Bang Won said.

138
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,560
Young Master!

139
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,990
Young Master!

140
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,440
Please stop for a bit.

141
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,530
Don't make a big fuss about it. Father

142
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,910
is safe inside there.

143
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,470
That scared me.

144
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,010
- Hurry and move him to the Gaegyeong residence.
- Yes. Let's go.

145
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,380
Let's go.

146
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,910
Thank you, everyone.

147
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,530
I will not forget this favor.

148
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,730
I am indebted to you. I'll pay you back.

149
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,560
The General has to be alive for you to pay me back, right?

150
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,100
I wish you good fortune.

151
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,370
- Let's go.
- What is your name?

152
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,920
Mal Saeng. Jo Mal Saeng.

153
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,150
Mal Saeng...

154
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,230
What's with your name?

155
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,240
What about my name?

156
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,870
- What happened? 
- Minister Lee Seong Gye went through Soongin Gate

157
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,440
He just entered his Gaegyeong residence.

158
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,780
Lee Seong Gye eventually got back.

159
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,510
Then now the important point is what condition he is in.

160
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,630
General. General!

161
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,010
Is he still unconscious?

162
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,170
Wife, the doctor. Quickly.

163
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,520
- Assassination?
- Assassination?

164
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,700
Who would order an assassination?

165
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,660
- I don't know but couldn't it be Lord Po Eun?
- Is he crazy?

166
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,280
He's someone who comes here every day. Why would he do that all of a sudden?

167
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,550
I knew something was up, when he sent Elder Sam Bong into exile.

168
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,220
Hey! Even so, why would he...

169
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,010
Go bring a doctor.

170
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,780
Yes. Come. Let's go.

171
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,830
Your Highness, I think

172
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:22,410
- that we must not stop here.
- But what if

173
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,780
Minister Lee's situation is not critical? What are you going to do?

174
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,090
I will go out.

175
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,740
- Wouldn't it be dangerous?
- Please don't worry.

176
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,660
Lee Seong Gye won't be able to do anything to me.

177
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,040
Follow Po Eun. You must protect him.

178

179
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,370
Let's go. Hey! Moo Hyul! Let's go.

180
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,370
Grandmother, I have somewhere to go to.

181
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,840
You can go first.

182
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,500
Excuse me. By any chance,

183
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,410
do you know whose residence this is?

184
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,860
This is Lord Woo Hak Joo's residence.

185
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,840
Lord Woo Hak Joo.

186
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,550
Warrior-nim!

187
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,410
Why are you following me?

188
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,820
I... Lady.

189
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,000
Last night,

190
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,890
it was you, right?

191
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,210
Right?

192
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,530
Could you be...

193
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,930
 Because Cheok Sa Gwang is a woman. 

194
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,560
Cheok Sa Gwang...

195
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,240
Is it you?

196
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,100
 Your identity must not be exposed. 

197
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,300
Are you?

198
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,700
Why are you going to kill our General?

199
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,100
That... It's the same for you.

200
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,690
Lord Po Eun was the first one to attack Elder Sam Bong and the others.

201
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,820
To do it as soon as General fell off his horse, that's a cheap shot.

202
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,040
Who is right or just,

203
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,250
let's not talk about that.

204
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,490
It doesn't mean anything.

205
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,800
 Do I have to kill him here? 

206
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,040
But actually,

207
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,430
you don't look like a person who would kill just anyone.

208
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,710
It doesn't suit you.

209
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:27,050
I actually don't have that much real fighting experience,

210
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,950
and I have no idea how the warrior world works.

211
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,980
But I am sure of one thing.

212
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,340
If you fight me,

213
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,400
you will die.

214
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,390
That's whyâ€”

215
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,310
But you don't like it, right?

216
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,380
Why did you only hit the warriors with the back of your blade at Byeokrando?

217
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,560
I also don't have much experience, but

218
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,940
it was my first time seeing that. I've never even heard of it.

219
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,050
Everyone is fighting while putting their lives on the line,

220
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,210
but why did you do that?

221
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:23,450
You also don't like killing people, right? It's terrible, right?

222
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,740
I'm actually like that too, but

223
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,980
it seems that you hate it more than I do.

224
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,740
That's right.

225
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,340
I really hate to kill,

226
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,120
so...

227
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,000
Let's not meet again.

228
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,900
What is his condition?

229
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,380
How is it that he still hasn't regained consciousness?

230
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,840
The external shock has greatly injured his organs and blood vessels.

231
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,980
So when is he going to wake up?

232
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,380
I also cannot tell right now.

233
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,180
I've done everything I can, so

234
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,440
we can only wait.

235
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,660
In this extremely important situation,

236
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,060
can we just leave it to the heavens?

237
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:48,550
Your Majesty, I've told Lord Woo Hak Joo to find out about Lee Seong Gye's condition, so

238
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,050
there will be news soon.

239
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:58,290
In a little bit, Jeong Do Jeon and the others will be transferred to Gaegyeong.

240
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,300
This country's fate lies on Lee Seong Gye's condition.

241
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,620
Yes.

242
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,370
We have to prepare for the different possible outcomes.

243
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,010
What happened?

244
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,770
Yes. We have confirmed it. It will be here soon.

245
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:31,820

246
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,730
 The doctor must not go outside. 

247
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,060
Look here!

248
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,220
Can you stay here

249
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,480
until Father wakes up?

250
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,440
Pardon?

251
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,500
Please stay.

252
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,380
Yes.

253
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,320
Get a room for this doctor to stay in.

254
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,540
Please follow me.

255
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,920
You must listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

256
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,780
Right now, Father's condition is what everyone is interested in.

257
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,040
so we must fool everyone until Father wakes up.

258
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,830
Then, what do we have to do?

259
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,370
First, go visit a doctor and as shown on this prescription,

260
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,010
ask for medicine that is good for internal bleeding from bruises and a tonic good for overall recovery.

261
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,970
Yes.

262
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:52,310
After that, go to the market and buy Father's favorite wine and dried persimmon

263
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,870
along with tea that has a good scent.

264
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,340
It's important to do it so that people will notice.

265
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,130
Do you understand?

266
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,540
- Yes.
- Yes. We understand.

267
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,340
Let's go.

268
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,350
Hello.

269
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,170
This...

270
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,750
For a man who is 58 years old.

271
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,470
He fell off his horse

272
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,990
- and he was hurt a little bit.
- Yes. A little bit.

273
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,580
I will then give you medicine for blood extravasation (effusion).

274
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,120
Yes.

275
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,900
Oh and also make something that's good for recovery

276
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,760
and throw in everything that gives energy.

277
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,410
I understand.

278
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,670
Blood extravasation? Are you sure?

279
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,270
Yes.

280
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,690
I personally heard what that house's servants said at the doctor's.

281
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,710
I understand. You may leave.

282
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,620
If it's only blood extravasation, then that means Lee Seong Gye's injuries are minor.

283
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,560
But Your Highness, they could have also purposely planned to do that to trick us.

284
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,840
We cannot completely believe in that just yet.

285
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,500
Even so, we cannot execute Jeong Do Jeon and the others without any assurance.

286
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,710
 Your Highness, Lord Woo Hak Joo is here. 

287
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,810
Let him in!

288
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,030
Right. What happened?

289
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:53,450
About that... The doctor who went into the Gaegyeong residence still hasn't come out.

290
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,730
The doctor didn't go out? How come?

291
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:03,180
In my opinion, Minister Lee's condition is not good so they are trying to hide that fact.
 (Woo Hak Joo) 

292
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,680
However, this is only another speculation.

293
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,830
We need more assurance.

294
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,690
You don't have to be scared.

295
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,210
You just have to properly answer our simple questions and you will be compensated.

296
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,520
Y-Yes.

297
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,680
You treated Lee Seong Gye who fell from his horse, right?

298
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,980
Yes. I did that.

299
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,650
How was Lee Seong Gye's condition?

300
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:33,370
Yes. When I first saw him, he was unconscious and he was in a critical condition.

301
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,650
He couldn't even lift himself.

302
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,010
If he hurriedly came to Gaegyeong in that condition,

303
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,330
on a funeral palanquin, what would his condition be by now?

304
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,800
If he had kept on moving like that, it would have become even worse.

305
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,040
It might even be dangerous.

306
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,830
 Lee Seong Gye 

307
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,740
 Who is right or just, 

308
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,640
 let's not talk about that. 

309
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,960
 It doesn't matter anyway. 

310
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,680
 Why doesn't it matter? 

311
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,870
 I'm fighting for the world that I believe in. 

312
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,590
Lady!

313
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,070
We are just, right?

314
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,830
That man called Po Eun backstabbed us, right?

315
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,940
Why are you like that? Did something happen?

316
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:17,090
Just that... It seems that I saw it as something really simple.

317
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,350
At first, it's because of success. I wanted to take care of my family.

318
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:29,930
But as I have gone along, I have come to like the things that we are doing and the world we are establishing,

319
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:37,310
so with my life on the line,  I fought those bad people who were blocking that world.

320
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,850
But why?

321
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,750
But the people we have to fight from here on

322
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,230
might not all be bad

323
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,090
or evil people, after all.

324
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,310
My thinking must have been incorrect, right?

325
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:08,680
 Are you following Jeong Do Jeon and Lee Seong Gye without that kind of resolve? 

326
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,870
 Abandoning the people who are important to you 

327
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:19,750
 and making an enemy out of those people, if you don't have that kind of resolve, then forget it. 

328
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,840
Someone said that

329
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,720
the people we have to fight from now on

330
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:37,140
could be people who are not only not bad, but who are important to us.

331
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,700
If you don't have that kind of resolve, then you should not get involved.

332
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,560
Do you have that kind of resolve?

333
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,780
I'm not sure.

334
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,020
I still have to do it anyway if I don't want to run away.

335
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,670
You have to be more prepared.

336
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,480
Fighting with a sword means that if you don't kill, you will die.

337
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,680
Let's not die.

338
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,750
 If you fight me, you will die. 

339
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:54,070
 Your grandfather and your father both died in the war. 

340
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,230
Aigoo! You scared me. I almost got hurt!

341
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,550
What's with your face? It's not the usual you. Do you need to go to the bathroom?

342
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,330
Teacher.

343
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,110
Teacher? What's with you?

344
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,690
How strong is the Goksan swordsmanship?

345
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,440
It's very overwhelming.

346
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,230
If I fight with Cheok Sa Gwang, will I lose?

347
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,220
Of course, you will lose.

348
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,190
Will I die?

349
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,860
You probably will.

350
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,910
Then, I'll probably die soon.

351
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,370
What are you saying?

352
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,790
I met her. Cheok Sa Gwang.

353
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,390
When?

354
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,790
On our way to escort General at Byeokrando.

355
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:08,920
When Cheok Sa Gwang swung just one strike, the whole palanquin split in half.

356
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,890
 Maincham. 

357
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,870
I couldn't even believe it.

358
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,200
It's called Maincham.

359
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,240
Maincham?

360
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:29,190
There was a story that when General Cheok Joon Gyung was at his peak, he cut the enemy general in half along with the horse the enemy general was riding on.

361
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,480
It's that technique.

362
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,990
Teacher.

363
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,950
I am going to meet Cheok Sa Gwang again.

364
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,760
If I meet her again, we will fight. And when we fight, I won't be able to win.

365
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,730
Bang Ji probably cannot do it either.

366
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,430
Run.

367
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,200
What?

368
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,480
You can just run so why are you worried?

369
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,900
Cheok Sa Gwang is targeting the General and not you.

370
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,930
If you run, she won't chase you.

371
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,370
That is true. That's right.

372
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,830
I guess you have matured a little bit.

373
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,840
But I don't think I can run away.

374
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,060
Why?

375
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,110
I don't know. I just can't do that.

376
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,850
Please tell me the weakness of the Goksan swordsmanship.

377
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,290
You probably have a reason why you went into their house as a servant.

378
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,660
It's because you wanted to know something.

379
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,000
That is right.

380
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,420
Please tell me its weakness.

381
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,740
About the Goksan swordsmaship...

382
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,410
Yes.

383
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,920
There's no weakness.

384
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,190
No matter how much I looked, I couldn't find it.

385
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,570
So there's no way then.

386
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,210
But Moo Hyul,

387
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,740
a weakness

388
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:11,650
not only applies to the swordsmanship but also to the person.

389
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:20,800
Elder Bon Won, General Nam Eun, and Lord Jo Joon are all being summoned to Gaegyeong.

390
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,420
How come? It hasn't been long since their exile.

391
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,950
Young Master, isn't this better?

392
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,470
I don't think so.

393
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,080
I think this is an impending execution.

394
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,290
And so?

395
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,440
I think this is the only chance.

396
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,250
We have to execute all of them.

397
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,880
What if Lee Seong Gye is okay?

398
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,260
What about the army?

399
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,220
There' are no strange movements.

400
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,330
What about the marketplaces in Gaegyeong?

401
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,250
Patrols have been strengthened.

402
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,880
A lot more of Investigation Bureau's soldiers are on the move than usual.

403
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,230
They disguise themselves, but we could tell because we memorized their faces.

404
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,710
Shouldn't we get the Ga Byeol Cho ready?

405
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,120
The new commanders of the left and the right armies are all Lord Po Eun's people.

406
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,390
Even Lee Bang Gwa has been removed from  the investigation bureau, so we are at a disadvantage.

407
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:30,120
Whether it be the left and right armies or the investigation bureau, do you know how many of our people are stationed there?

408
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,530
If something happens, they will be all on our side.

409
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,960
That was when General Lee Seong Gye was still around.

410
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Lord Po Eun spread a rumor throughout the whole army that General Lee Seong Gye is in a critical condition.

411
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,360
We don't know for sure what will happen.

412
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:47,480
Young Master, what do we have to do?

413
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,890
Yes.

414
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,750
You have to make a decision now.

415
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,990
We cannot just leave Elder Bon Won like this.

416
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,280
Yes, Young Master.

417
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,910
If you make a decision, we will follow it no matter what.

418
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:08,460
 Perhaps, the answer might have been there all along, from a long time ago. 

419
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:14,010
Where is Jeong Mong Joo right now?

420
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,760
His Highness cannot make the decision.

421
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:24,880
Before he finds out Lee Seong Gye's condition, he can't make any decisions.

422
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,170
I will go to His Highness.

423
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,230
General!

424
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,200
Is anyone out there?

425
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,270
Come here!

426
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,920
 Lord Po Eun is in the palace. 

427
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,460
 Palace. He probably is there. 

428
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,610
 He will need to be inside the palace...along with the protection from the 5000 royal army. 

429
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,490
 But... 

430
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,840
 There's a different sword to use in turbulent times? 

431
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,270
 No. That's just the bug that's growing in your heart. 

432
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,620
 If it's turbulent times now, 

433
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,070
 then it would be sweetly whispering to you that you have no choice but to survive the turbulent times. 

434
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,000
 Po Eun. It's so that I won't lose Po Eun. 

435
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,740
 Since I said that I will persuade Po Eun until the day I die, then I'd have to do it. 

436
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,640
Please give me the royal command.

437
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,520
What will you do with it?

438
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,100
Are you going to do the execution?

439
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,320
Whatever condition Lee Seong Gye is in, we must not waste time like this.

440
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,520
So?

441
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,820
Please give me the royal command for the executions,

442
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:00,020
and if things go wrong, please push all the fault on me.

443
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,110
Say that I forcibly stole the royal seal

444
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,560
and it all happened because of my own decision.

445
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,770
Po Eun.

446
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:12,260
 King Gong Yang, Goryeo's Last King 

447
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,240
If something happens to you, Po Eun,

448
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,130
I can't do anything by myself anyway.

449
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:31,840
Your Highness, Lee Seong Gye can never do anything to me.

450
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,310
Please don't worry.

451
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,380
Please give me the royal command.

452
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:49,880
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

453
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,940
 Why are you pretending to look like you're in agony? 

454
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,810
What do you mean?

455
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,830
 Then, are you really in agony?
(Hong In Bang) 

456
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,010
 Then does it look I'm all excited? 

457
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,570
 Goryeo's lifeline is now Po Eun's life. 

458
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:31,950
 Isn't thinking of ending that making your heart flutter? 

459
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,940
Don't talk nonsense to me.

460
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,760
 The person who ends Goryeo will be the one to open Joseon. 

461
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:50,010
 Also, you will be the person who killed Po Eun, who is a great Confucian scholar and the great teacher of Sadaebu. 

462
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:55,300
 What do you think? Are you scared or is your heart fluttering? 

463
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,850
 Accept yourself. 

464
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:06,380
 You're actually caught up in something. 

465
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,630
 The things that will happen to you after you kill Po Eun. 

466
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,170
 "What if my position (in the organization and society) becomes smaller?" 

467
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,230
 "What if, because of this incident, something happens to laying a foundation for my successors?" 

468
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,170
 Also, aren't you scared and hesitant because you might become lonely after the world turns away from you? 

469
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,120
Young Master, how...

470
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,340
How come you're like that?

471
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,010
Are you on my side?

472
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,870
I am asking you if you're on my side.

473
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:26,110
Of course, I am on your side.

474
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,940
Tomorrow, and

475
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,800
no matter what happens tonight...

476
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,370
If you can't answer me, then just forget it.

477
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,320
Are you going to kill him?

478
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,200
Lord Po Eun.

479
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,730
I don't understand political relationships and things like that,

480
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:13,000
but I know that Lord Po Eun is an important person to the General and Elder Bon Won

481
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,890
so I also know that it's a difficult task.

482
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,030
But as for myself,

483
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,340
in order to fight against someone even more important than that

484
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,820
I am fighting through gritted teeth.

485
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,200
That's why right now, I am on your side.

486
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,200
That's right. I will kill Po Eun.

487
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,460
It's a plan from here on. We need to drag Po Eun out of the palace.

488
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,160
I...

489
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:02,190
I haven't told you the reason why I urgently came here.

490
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,770
What is it?

491
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,620
That person has come.

492
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,670
How is the General?

493
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,610
I came to visit since he seemed okay.

494
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,000
Visiting the sick?

495
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,310
 Po Eun... This man is truly bold. 

496
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,940
Yes.

497
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,300
Are you going to keep someone who came to visit out here?

498
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,360
No. Please go inside for now.

499
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,460
Go out and wait.

500
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,870
I must not.

501
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,050
Please do so. Hurry.

502
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,110
Visiting the sick?

503
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:08,190
I know that you sent assasins to Byeokrando.

504
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,730
How many lives do you think you have?

505
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:23,710
Even General Lee Seong Gye has put his sword on my neck.

506
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,540
He couldn't do it.

507
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,260
Can you do it?

508
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,360
What did you say?

509
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,630
As I said, I only came to visit the sick.

510
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,800
Please let me see General Lee.

511
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,400
Teacher Po Eun.

512
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:01,370
I also tried to kill Hyung-nim.

513
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:08,780
I had bloody fights with Hyung-nim in the Northeast.

514
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,250
That's how I got caught.

515
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,600
I thought I would die right away

516
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:26,370
Even more fiercely than when he was fighting me, he persuaded me and soothed me.

517
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,760
He took me in as a younger brother.

518
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,690
He promised to protect our tribe and all our people.

519
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,850
Our Hyung-nim is that kind of person.

520
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:47,720
Even though you did something terrible to Hyung-nim,

521
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,260
if only you would change your mind, he would forget everything.

522
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,420
He's someone who would take you in as a brother,

523
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,880
Teacher Po Eun.

524
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:10,910
Can't you think about it one more time?

525
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,930
Please let me see the General.

526
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,310
Teacher!

527
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,000
Could he be

528
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,720
still unconscious?

529
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,760
Father! Are you okay?

530
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,920
Po Eun came?

531
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,070
Yes. He came and said he's here to visit you.

532
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,610
He couldn't be more shameless.

533
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:48,740
Father, this is a chance from heaven.

534
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,740
I will plot a scheme on Po Eun.

535
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,930
You bastard!

536
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,030
Don't say nonsense.

537
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:03,120
Nonsense? He wanted to kill you.

538
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,880
I killed General Choi Yeong who I've served my whole life

539
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,340
I plotted a scheme on Teacher Lee Saek, who is a great teacher of this country,

540
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,590
and dethroned and killed two kings.

541
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,820
Do you want me to kill Po Eun, who has come to my house, as well?

542
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,590
Father.

543
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:25,970
If you want the great cause to happen, then stop saying nonsense.

544
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,750
Let Po Eun in.

545
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,350
General.

546
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,800
How can you meet with a schemer like that?

547
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,850
Let him in!

548
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,140
I asked if he is unconscious.

549
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,750
What are you saying?

550
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,810
Let me meet him before I go.

551
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,360
Teacher Po Eun, Father wants to meet you.

552
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:16,220
You tried to kill me to protect Goryeo.

553
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,010
If I have to choose between you and Goryeo,

554
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:30,500
there is only a clear answer for me.

555
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,250
If I die,

556
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,020
will Goryeo survive?

557
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,560
It's hard but I have to try.

558
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,250
Why do you even have to do that?

559
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,880
Yes. I didn't want to do it.

560
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:55,160
That's why I tried to make you change your mind.

561
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,660
I clearly told you that we shouldn't meet again.

562
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,330
You are the one that came to me.

563
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:16,090
What I said was for you to run far away.

564
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,320
I've thought about it a lot, but

565
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,260
I am not going to run away.

566
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,880
King Woo's rule... During that 14 years

567
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:43,360
the country couldn't protect the people from the invasion of Japanese pirates.

568
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:48,650
If the country cannot protect its people, then how can you call it a country?

569
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:56,650
What the country cannot do, I, Lee Seong Gye, have accomplished.

570
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:01,160
Actually, whether it is Choi Yeong or Lee In Gyeom,

571
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:07,180
they could have attacked the powerful Gwon Moon Sae Jeok  if they'd set their minds to it.

572
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:11,530
If they'd focused on national defense, anyone could've done it.

573
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:15,760
But no one did it.

574
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,820
That's why I eventually got rid of them

575
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,120
and protected the country and the people.

576
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,260
Yes! You did it, General.

577
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,250
So even in the future, as a general,

578
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,150
you can just protect the country and the people, right?

579
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,860
After establishing a new country, we can live better

580
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,610
and I can protect it even better.

581
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:46,030
That's what you call a rationalization, a self-justification.

582
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:51,600
Do you think Choi Choong Heon and Lee In Gyeom didn't have any justification?  (Choi Choong Heon, a figure in Goryeo era who took over the government and enforced military rule.) 

583
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,710
But even they didn't say that they would make a new country.

584
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,600
Look here, Po Eun.

585
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:06,720
They didn't have any ideas or ambitions for the future.

586
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,380
I am different from Choi Choong Heon.

587
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:17,340
I have the idea and the ambition called Sam Bong and Po Eun.

588
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:24,200
Po Eun, do you think I'm doing this because I want to become king?

589
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:31,140
You know full well that it's something that I have to do because I have no other choice.

590
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:36,330
I still don't understand politics.

591
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,630
You can just practice politics yourself.

592
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:50,120
Not too long ago, as we all shared wine at Do Hwa Jeon,

593
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,740
we talked about each other's dreams.

594
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,400
My dream...

595
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,880
My dream is

596
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:08,600
your and Sam Bong's will to come true. I am protecting that.

597
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:19,190
Po Eun, please give it another thought.

598
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:25,130
Please. Please think about it again, Po Eun.

599
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,070
General! General!

600
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:42,000
Father! Father! Are you okay?

601
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,030
I hope you get better, General.

602
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,100
Let's go.

603
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,700
Tomorrow,  at myoshi (5-7am),

604
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:01,140
proceed with Sam Bong's execution.

605
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,620
Yes. I understand.

606
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:15,280
Teacher Sam Bong was immediately imprisoned as soon as he arrived in Gaegyeong. There is also word going around that he will be executed soon.

607
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,710
Are you just going to stay like this?

608
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,960
Whether you take him out of prison or assemble the soldiers and cause a coup, aren't you supposed to save Teacher Sam Bong?

609
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,290
Right now, whether it's breaking out of prison or a coup, it's impossible.

610
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,630
- So? Are you giving up?
- No.

611
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,870
Po Eun.

612
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,110
Po Eun.

613
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:51,590
I'm going to  have to kill him.

614
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,220
 Isn't it going the way you want it to? 

615
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:05,950
 Lee Seong Gye going out on a hunt at an out of the ordinary time. An unexpected assassination attempt. 

616
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:11,750
 And falling off of a horse. To think that such small coincidences have led everything to this point. 

617
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,730
 Now, this is the end of Lee Seong Gye and his followers. 

618
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,900
 I'm not sure. Will they really end? 

619
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,260
 Each side's will, determination, desire, coincidence, and luck 

620
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,270
 Or some clever plot or the overwhelming difference in power. 

621
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:40,210
 If everything is decided based on these factors, how easy would it be to figure out the world? 

622
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:45,330
 Fate can be affected by such trivial things. 

623
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,620
 Fate is like that of an ill-tempered three-year-old child. 

624
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:56,940
 To what will his mind change again? 

625
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:03,960
 When morning breaks, it will be scary and heart fluttering. 

626
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:12,220
 This will be the longest night in Goryeo's history. 

627
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:41,000
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

628
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,540
 Six Flying Dragons 

629
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:52,990
 For the people, whether this or that happens, what matters to them? 

630
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:59,700
 Even if the kudzu vines on Mansu Mountain are all intertwined, there's no one who would blame them. 

631
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,520
 By killing me again and again, try killing me a hundred times. 

632
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:10,840
 Even if all my bones rot away and my body becomes soil and the dust, 

633
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:16,170
 the one part of my body, the unwavering and passionate heart I have towards this country, 

634
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:22,100
 you won't be able to kill my loyal heart.
