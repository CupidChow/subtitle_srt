1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,930


2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,590
 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

3
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,510
Look here. Hey, look here.

4
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,430
"Kill the ash tree flower"

5
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,780
 "Kill the ash tree flower"? 

6
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,000
Fifth day of the month.

7
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,530
Mishi (1pm-3pm).

8
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,540
You've heard something you shouldn't have.

9
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,460
 "The one who never existed will always be there". 

10
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,210
 "A nameless person 

11
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,040
 does not disappear." 

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,600
 But the thing is all the members in the organization only know their direct supervisor. 

13
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,670
"The one who never existed

14
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,800
will always be there".

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,780
 Cho Moo Ja Moo Jin: The one who never existed  will always be there 

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,940
A person without a name does not disappear.

17
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,060
It's my first time seeing you.

18
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,340
 I've never seen you before. 

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,060
 That's because I'm from the Cheonmyeongjo branch. 

20
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,200
That's because I'm from the Cheonmyeongjo branch.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,930
Cheonmyeongjo?

22
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,280
For what reason have you come here yourself?

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,680
 Just what is Chenmyeongjo?
(Boon Yi) 

24
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,690
"Kill the ash tree flower..."

25
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,770
Since someone who knows about the plan to kill the ash tree flower is imprisoned in the Investigation Bureau,

26
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,290
I've been ordered to go investigate it myself.

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,130
However!

28
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,190
A command has already been sent to Monk Gil

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,180
so why did that person send another order to Cheonmyeongjo?

30
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,790
 Monk Gil? Monk Gil? 

31
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,130
 That person? 

32
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,900
 Leave. 

33
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,690
 Monk Gil. 

34
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,870
 He's Gil Seon Mi. 

35
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,650
Didn't you know that Monk Gil Seon Mi has failed on two things already?

36
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,350
Failed?

37
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,570
He failed to acquire Jo Joon's data at Dongjin Marketplace.

38
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,110
Then after following Sam Bong and falling into a trap,

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,290
he even got followed to that temple.

40
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,270
This time, he said not to fail.

41
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,790
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,340
 I must not answer any more questions. 

43
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,300
 I should ask questions. A question... 

44
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,770
But—

45
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,610
Where is he right now?

46
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,770
In order to finish the task of "killing the ash tree flower", he's gone to Ji Cheon Tae's place.

47
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,140
 Ji Cheon Tae? 

48
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,780
Once the "kill the ash tree flower" plan succeeds, he said that he there needs to be a strong power to quickly deploy our secret agents,

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,870
so he will use Ji Cheon Tae who has many connections.

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,750
 Find him! He is wearing a black robe! 

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,290
 Surround this place completely! 

52
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,270
I will lure them so please escape.

53
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,750
The one that never existed will always be there.

54
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,100
A nameless person does not disappear.

55
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,500
Lady!

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,330
He died here. Damn.
 (Jo Young Gyu) 

57
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,650
Did you happen to see a man wearing a black robe?

58
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,010
I did. I saw him.

59
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,080
You saw him?

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,020
Lady.

61
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,330
 Come to Yeoamjeong by mishi (1pm-3pm) on the fifth day of the month. Then you'll be able to see your mother. 

62
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,590
No one should know about it.

63
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,850
 If you don't follow the rules, you won't ever see her. 

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,500
Yes. He said, "Kill the ash tree flower."

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,300
"Kill the ash tree flower." What is that?

66
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,540
It's my first time hearing that.

67
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,380
Aiyoo, these bastards. What are they planning now?

68
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,390
They said fifth day of the month, at mishi (1pm-3pm).

69
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,850
Fifth day of the month, at mishi...

70
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,030
 The previous king in Yeojoo will be giving him a royal gift. 

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,740
 It's by mishi (1pm-3pm) on the fifth day of the month. So he said to prepare well. 

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,420
Didn't they say the royal gift will be here at mishi on the fifth day of the month?

73
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,440
Yeah... That's right.

74
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,080
Then, it's tomorrow at the hour of Mi.

75
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,940
 Is it alright if I leave for a bit on the fifth day of the month? 

76
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,800
 I need to go to the Western district. 

77
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,120
Why are you looking at me like that?

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,270
Lee Bang Ji.

79
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,120
Didn't you say that you won't be here tomorrow because you're going to the Western district?

80
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,440
I did.

81
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,920
Brother, you're going to the Western district?

82
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,360
Tell me honestly. Are you really going to the Western district?
 (Lee Bang Won) 

83
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,040
Why?

84
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,760
Do I have to  everything to you?

85
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,750
The time when the previous king's royal gift arrives,

86
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,430
is at mishi on the fifth day of the month.

87
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,400
We have information that Nameless is plotting something

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,070
under the phrase "kill the ash tree flower", which is also at mishi on the fifth day of the month.

89
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,870
It's tomorrow.

90
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,160
The time you won't be here is also tomorrow.

91
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,070
Can this all be a coincidence?

92
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,020
Are you suspecting my brother right now?

93
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,600
Tell me. Are you really going to the Western district?

94
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,020
If you are, I will bow my head and apologize here.

95
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,760
 Come to Yeoamjeong by mishi on the fifth day of the month. 

96
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,910
Damn it.

97
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,430
Gil Seon Mi told me to come by mishi on the fifth day of the month.

98
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,110
so I can meet Mother.

99
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,770
What?

100
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,420
I think they tricked me into leaving.

101
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,960
It's something that has to happen when Father receives the royal gift and when you're not here.

102
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,000
What could it be?

103
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,380
Assassination?

104
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,600
'Gyu'

105
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,490
'Mok'

106
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,500
'Hwa'

107
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,840
'Gyu Mok Hwa'

108
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,850
'Gyu Mok Hwa'

109
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,310
'Gyu Mok Hwa'

110
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,430
When you combine the characters 'gyu' and 'mok', it becomes the character 'gye'.

111
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,520
That's the last character in the General's name!

112
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,960
'Gyu mok hwa' is 'gye hwa'. It represents Father.

113
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,580
Then what about the 'Sa'?

114
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,040
'Gyu mok hwa' dies.

115
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,020
It's an assassination.

116
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,720
Oh my!

117
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,340
The previous king's royal gift has arrived.

118
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:29,250
General of the Right Army, Minister Lee Seong Gye,

119
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:35,670
please accept the previous king's royal gift.
 (Kim Jeo) 

120
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,660
Have a drink of the previous king's liquor.

121
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,970
 Something went wrong. 

122
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,730
Impudent!

123
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,150
What are you doing?

124
00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:00,470
You bastards dare to kill me, Lee Seong Gye?
 (Lee Seong Gye) 

125
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,470
Yes? What are you saying?

126
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:22,950
 You must remember this. In the case that you fail, 

127
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,510
 you have to go while saying this. 

128
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,010
Long live the previous king!

129
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,750
Everyone, follow him!

130
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,470
 He's fast. 

131
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,150
Go after him.

132
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,350
What's your name? Your name.

133
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,590
I need to know your name for me to tell everyone that I caught you.
 (Moo Hyul) 

134
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,390
Mr. Cheok from Gok San.

135
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,190
 Mr. Cheok from Gok San? 

136
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,950
Not your surname but just your name. Why is it that you guys never tell me your names?

137
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,170
There's a blood trail. Follow it.

138
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,830
Yes!

139
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:47,550


140
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,630
It's here.

141
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,430
No way. Are you saying he jumped from here?

142
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,370
He would die if he jumped from here.

143
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,430
If this person knew how to use the Chool Ha Sool technique...

144
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,630
- Chool Ha Sool?
- It's the opposite of Chool Sang Sool.

145
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,770
If that person uses Chool Ha Sool, he safely landed after jumping from a height like this.

146
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,030
But he was definitely hit by the arrow and my stroke was directly on him so he couldn't have gone too far away.

147
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,850
We have to find him and expose the person behind this case.

148
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,030
Tell the Ga Byeol Cho to surround this mountain and search.

149
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,710
Yes! let's go.

150
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,350
Let's go.

151
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,950
I can't believe another superiority existed.

152
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,390
I really don't know anything!

153
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:33,230
When I went to Yeo Joo, Lord Kim Jeo and General Han were already with the previous king.

154
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,210
I only went to the previous king after receiving orders.

155
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,510
Why did you go to Yeo Joo in the first place?

156
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,910
Lord Lee Saek told me to go.

157
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,030
I only went to deliver Lord Lee Saek's message.
 (Nam Eun) 

158
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,550
What was that message?

159
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,310
That... Just...

160
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,250
What?

161
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:07,210
There was an assassination plot against Lee Seong Gye at the place where he was supposed to receive the king's royal gift.

162
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:13,610
General Han, who failed, shouted, "Long live the previous king!" and committed suicide.

163
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:20,250
That's not the important thing. Lord Joo Sang Won was there. He was taken to the Investigation Bureau.
 (Woo Hak Joo) 

164
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,910
Just how did this happen? How can he say,"Long live the previous king"?
 (Han Goo Young) 

165
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,430
If the previous king plotted this, it will have an effect on the current king as well.

166
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,970
Also...

167
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:40,670
We all cannot foresee what will happen as well.

168
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,710
Long live the previous king?

169
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,510
That's what he said. Now, the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok are in Yeo Joo,

170
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,190
who put the current king in position and the previous king in Yeo Joo.

171
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,090
Even Teacher Mok Eun and the Sadaebu who are following him,

172
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,790
for you as well, it is hard to tell your future.

173
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,930
That is how it is. Even if it wasn't the previous king's plot, they would have tried to fabricate a connection to him.

174
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,130
But he committed suicide after yelling long live the previous king.

175
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,490
 Ha Ryun 

176
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,410
So they are...

177
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,210
What do you mean?

178
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,790
No. Nothing.

179
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,160
Isn't it obvious that it was the Nameless' plot?

180
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,090
If they are going to assassinate Father-in-law for the previous king,

181
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,170
they will not send an assassin as a royal gift and he wouldn't have shouted, "Long live the previous king."

182
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,180
Husband, Nameless' is planning something.

183
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,430
- Nameless is not the only problem.
- What?

184
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,570
 How will Teacher Po Eun act now? 

185
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:12,690
 Already between the officers and Sadaebu, they are saying the previous king, as well as the current king, are going to be dethroned. 

186
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,170
Dethronement, dethrone?

187
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,320
I can't wait any longer. I'll have to move faster than General Lee Seong Gye.

188
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,800
Those bastards. They are trying to assassinate you whenever they can.

189
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,830
Does there have to be more bloodshed?

190
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,270
General, in order to minimize the further blood loss,

191
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,520
what do you think about going all out in one shot?

192
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,160
What do you mean by that?

193
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,270
Please sit on the throne.

194
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,930
 Long live the previous king! 

195
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:14,000
 Just why did he scream long live? 

196
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,230
Gil Seon Mi.

197
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,160
He used our mother and tricked me.

198
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,500
- Brother. 
- Boon.

199
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,080
I don't think our mother is a part of Nameless.

200
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,240
She's just getting used for things like that, right?

201
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,770
I've to rescue her.

202
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,740
 It would be nice if that were the case, but... 

203
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,970
 "The one who never existed will always be there." 

204
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,650
 A nameless person 

205
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,270
 does not disappear. 

206
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,570
 That code worked. 

207
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,030
 Our mom is a part of Nameless. 

208
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,720
I'll escort her.

209
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,770
 (Yeon Hyang) 

210
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,920
They failed. Mr. Cheok ran to the mountains,

211
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,150
but we do not know his life status.

212
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,670
Did Lee Bang Ji sense something?

213
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,960
What do we have to do now?
 (Jeok Ryong: Bi Guk Temple Head Monk) 

214
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,080
Are we going to proceed to the next step?

215
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,220
That person said that we have nothing to do.

216
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,520
The solution to the problem is extremely simple.

217
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,570
The solution to the problem is extremely simple?

218
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,090
If you find the right spot to hold your sword.

219
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,390
Then even if you just put your blade on the bamboo, it's meant to be cut.

220
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,180
That's what you're saying, right?

221
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,010
We have already put our blade on the right spot.
 (Gil Sun Mi) 

222
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,130
- Is that it?
- By now,

223
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,960
Po Eun has probably gone to Prince Jeong Chang.

224
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,610
What are you saying?

225
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,960
What do you mean be ready to sit on the throne?

226
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,630
- How can you say that?
- I'm just being realistic.

227
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,420
Anyhow,

228
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,350
now we are at a state where we cannot be sure of the current king's place.

229
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,100
Look here, Po Eun.

230
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,670
No, the more important thing

231
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,200
is for a king from the bloodline of King Taejo to step up

232
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,410
to reestablish this country, Goryeo.

233
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,460
Just why are you doing this to me?

234
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,740
Lee In Gyeom only put the current king in his position

235
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,040
to reach his greedy goals, even when we are not even sure of the king's birth history.

236
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,100
What was the result of that?

237
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,810
There is disaster and the Japanese pirates are coming in every ten days.

238
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,580
In the middle of that, the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok

239
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,050
had taken all the hard-earned money of the people and treated them harshly.

240
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,070
The previous king only indulged in luxury and pleasures.

241
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,700
What about before that?

242
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,120
Was it better before?
 (King Yo - the 34th king, King Gong Yang in the future) 

243
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,510
During the 23 years of King Gong Min's time,

244
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,680
it was just in the first seven or eight years.

245
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,450
Was there anything King Gong Min lacked?

246
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,670
It was a country even someone like him could not raise.

247
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,980
Then how can a person like me take that position.

248
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,190
What are you going to do with this country?

249
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,870
I am trying to raise this country again.

250
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,300
I believe that is the responsibility of a Confucian.

251
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,630
Therefore, Prince Jeong Chang, also

252
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,270
as one with the tradition of the royal family,

253
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,660
please take responsibility for that tradition.

254
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,910
To me...

255
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,720
Please give me some time.

256
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:31,240


257
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,380
Wait a second.

258
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,040
Teacher Po Eun? He went to Prince Jeong Chang again.

259
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,920
He is not the one to be surprised about.

260
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,780
- Do you know who I saw?
- Who did you see?

261
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,360
I saw Baek Geun Soo

262
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,180
going inside Prince Jeong Chang's house.

263
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,950
I can't believe that traitor bastard was hiding in that place.

264
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,830
For now, use more people and thoroughly

265
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,500
keep your eyes on Prince Jeong Chang's house.

266
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,440
- Yes sir.
- It's Prince Jeong Chang.

267
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,420
We have the obligations.

268
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,470
We have gotten rid of the fake one and put up the genuine.

269
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,900
The king right now is part of the Shin Don family.

270
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,410
There are rumors like that but...

271
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,690
- It just has to not be a rumor.
- Colleague.

272
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,660
General, you also had Prince Jeong Chang in your mind when you were retreating.

273
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,880
After the Moshin had the political power, for the past 200 years,

274
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,850
this country had become a place where people fight each other because of their personal greed.

275
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,530
A country that was destroyed like that...

276
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,120
King Gong Min tried to raise the country again but

277
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,520
he lost his chance because of the Chinese invasion.

278
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,650
But it's different now.

279
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,610
Since you are in  control of Goryeo's defense, we are safe.

280
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,750
Given the opportunity you created this time,

281
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,960
don't you think we have to succeed in the reform of this country?

282
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,930
Like we had promised last time, we are now one person.

283
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,950
I will help you with all my power.

284
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,750
Make prince Jeong Chang become the King.

285
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,050
There is something I really have to do.

286
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,900
- Please speak about it.
- This case also—

287
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,590
- The Nameless are involved in it.
- Are you saying that

288
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,670
the previous King is working with the Nameless?

289
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,180
General Han died yelling long live the previous king.

290
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,990
Why do you he did that? Probably,

291
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,990
it doesn't it seem like

292
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,920
he was aiming to dethrone the king?

293
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,770
What do you really want to say?

294
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,280
Also, if the current king is dethroned the next in line

295
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,570
is Prince Jeong Chang.

296
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,250
Therefore, are you saying that

297
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,810
I am being controlled by the Nameless?

298
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,850
Or do you think that I am the Nameless?

299
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,790
Through the guidance of Nameless, you came into my cave.

300
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:43,720
- Am I right?
- No you're not.

301
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,890
I'll believe you, then.

302
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,790
Promise me one thing.

303
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,740
The goal of the Nameless is to stop the land survey.

304
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,380
However, under any circumstances, we have to succeed with the land survey.

305
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,650
- Of course,
- Even if

306
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,330
that means attacking Teacher Lee Saek.

307
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,850
Will you still do that?

308
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,970
Please answer.

309
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,130
I will definitely do that.

310
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,620
I have to step on the stage as well.

311
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,620
There is a merchant ship in Yangjin-po. Store this there and come back.

312
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,930
Tomorrow is your marriage so for what reason...

313
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,410
Just quickly move as I have commanded and

314
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,490
tonight at the time sulshi (7-9 pm), let's meet in front of the house.

315
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,530
Yes, I understand.

316
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,360
What's the problem? We have to know what is happening so

317
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,860
it is easy for us to do things.

318
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,110
- Are you inside?
- No, you cannot come in.

319
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,840
Please go back, you have to look at these clothes during the wedding.

320
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,560
Elder.

321
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,640
What's wrong?

322
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,740
I'm sorry.

323
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,340
I know how much you waited for this day.

324
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,950
What's wrong? Please tell me.

325
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,310
Tonight, we have to leave.

326
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,740
What? For what reason? 
 (Yoon Rang) 

327
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,740
If we waste our time today,

328
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,680
without a doubt, I'll become the king.

329
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,980
The throne right now is just perfect for someone to die on.

330
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,170
If I die,

331
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,660
you also won't be well.

332
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,270
What am I going to do with you?

333
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,630
Therefore, escape is the only solution.

334
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,790
You and I, for us to live that is the only way.

335
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,400
Will you come with me?

336
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:49,730
Will you be okay even if I am not a rich merchant in a place like this?

337
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,250
Yes.

338
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,730
What is it again?

339
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,950
What did you hear? Sit down.

340
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,850
At Prince Jeong Chang's house there is someone who is part of the Nameless.

341
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,220
What do you mean?

342
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,140
It is someone named Baek Geun Soo who previously sneaked into the Ga Beol Cho.

343
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,310
Young Gyu is watching them.

344
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,480
Also, General Han died yelling, "Long live the previous king."

345
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,730
Didn't you also think that something was not right?

346
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,990
There is a high possibility that Prince Jeong Chang is someone the Nameless wants.

347
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,890
But you are thinking of setting him up as the king?

348
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,210
I think that right now is our opportunity.

349
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,780
Please make Father the king!

350
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,800
That cannot be done.

351
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,480
He does not have that in mind as well.

352
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,170
Is it because of Teacher Po Eun?

353
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,790
I envy you so much.

354
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,250
I only heard about it few days ago.

355
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,140
On the day the three generals were about to be killed because of Kim Young,

356
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,710
even when teacher Lee Saek kept his silence,

357
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:03,360
you and Teacher Po Eun, only you two, kept speaking out with all your might and kept your beliefs.

358
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,530
The two of you who shared your studies and beliefs like that,

359
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:14,500
after time passed one made a system for the country and the other raised the people up.

360
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,540
Now you guys have met once again and are on the same terms, what can you guys not accomplish?

361
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,110
So,

362
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,080
I am more scared of Nameless.

363
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,330
From the Nameless' side there were many men they could have sent to the cave.

364
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,820
So they could have easily plotted against us as traitors and

365
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,910
in the end could have controlled us with power.

366
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,910
But they sent Teacher Po Eun.

367
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,520
Someone you want to be with the most, someone you think you need the most for this reform,

368
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,610
but someone to whom you cannot speak of a revolution.

369
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:14,250
These days, as I see you and my father, I think that the Nameless are very clever.

370
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,290
After Teacher Po Eun had visited the cave, you have—

371
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,750
Why? Does it seem like I have given up on the revolution?

372
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,740
No, I am doing a revolution harder than any other time,

373
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,590
because for one of the main points of the new country it has to be Po Eun.

374
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,900
What?

375
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,470
What do you mean?

376
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:42,530
I will tell you about that slowly. He will be with us.

377
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:48,620
As we go on with the reform, colleague Po Eun will eventually start to understand.

378
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,410
What about the Nameless?

379
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,630
I will never forgive them.

380
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,360
I have already told Po Eun about that and we will find them together.

381
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,990
But if by chance, what if Po Eun becomes swayed by the Nameless?

382
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:15,540
If that happens, I will murder Po Eun.

383
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,190
Now do you feel relieved?

384
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:31,170
Teacher you said that General Choi Young was a dangerous politician because he had no greed.

385
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:41,370
In my eyes, you and my father have a very expensive greed.

386
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,500
It sounds like a sarcasm.

387
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Are you saying that for people in politics it is too much greed?

388
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,210
Yes.

389
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,460
However, if you say that again, it means beyond more.

390
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:02,740
General Lee Seong Gye and I, and also Po Eun.  Are trying to protect that beyond more.

391
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:08,550
Since we all gathered together in believing in that "beyond more", I'm going to believe in them and move on.

392
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,200
He seems like Prince Jeong Chang's private warrior.

393
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,150
- Gosh that traitor bastard. 
- Private warrior?

394
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:26,620
What do we do? Since prince Jeong Chang is one of the royal elders, and he is associated with him, we can't just go and capture him.

395
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,450
We cannot just let that guy be.

396
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,390
What should we do?

397
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,420
Baek Geun Soo, we have to capture him secretly.

398
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,620
Send skillful assassins to him, this secretly as well.

399
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,860
Yes sir.

400
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,160
Ji Cheon Tae?

401
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,400
Yeah.

402
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,430
Ji Cheon Tae. That is one of the 64 things mentioned in the Book of Changes.

403
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:55,360
The thing is, back then the Nameless guy said that Gil Seon Mi is at Ji Cheon Tae.

404
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,590
Unni can you look in to this?

405
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:03,050
I will try, but with only that...

406
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,520
Why? Do you get it?

407
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,630
No, I'll have to check first.

408
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:36,430
Gil Seon Mi, that guy is definitely an important member of the Nameless. He knew about my mother.

409
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:54,770
It was a very strong style of swordsmanship that I have never seen before.

410
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,220
That...seems like it won't work.

411
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,570
Aigo, why are you bothering someone who is practicing.

412
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,780
That is what I'm saying, when my older brother is practicing.

413
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,880
That won't work, how can that work, it won't work.

414
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,450
Why are you saying it won't work?

415
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,270
To me, this is something that cannot work, but

416
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:31,980
I think your teacher told you to do this so that you can get stronger through this practice.

417
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:39,050
 Indeed, Teacher just told me to do this but he never showed me how to do it. 

418
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,170
This, this, this won't ever work.

419
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,810
If it is an object you can just tap, tap, slash.

420
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:52,010
But, isn't this water? Water does not have a shape so there is no possible way that it can work.

421
00:38:52,010 --> 00:39:00,670
Then, when you cannot perform martial arts yourself, how can you invent a sword style and teach others?

422
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,940
That is a good question.

423
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,160
Truthfully, my body cannot handle it. It won't follow through.

424
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,560
But, to me I have a great eye.

425
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,560
When was it? It was when I was very young.
 (Hong Dae Hong - teacher of Moo Hyul) 

426
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,920
I saw a sparrow that came out from a field faraway.

427
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,780
But I saw the eye booger on the left eye of the sparrow.

428
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,150
On top of that, that guy was a female.

429
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,640
He's crazy.

430
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,350
It's a lie.

431
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,630
Isn't it astounding? I was also surprised.

432
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:49,270
Also whenever I saw someone fight, their movements were slowed down like this.

433
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,110
Clash.

434
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:56,560
Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, splash.

435
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:04,850
Every movement were started to be seen clearly. I remembered everything, no matter how complicated it was.

436
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,740
I am only telling you this, but

437
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,750
the Twin Dragons of the East Swordsmanship also started from this ability.

438
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,390
 I shouldn't have asked him. 

439
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,300
Long time ago, I was working under a house.

440
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,790
That house's housewife, oh that housewife. She was someone amazing.

441
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,500
One day, I saw her practicing her sword style in the yard.

442
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,870
I was peeking at her like this but that sword style.

443
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,290
What's wrong?

444
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,680
How can I forget that?

445
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,830
That swordsmanship... That swordsmanship that was in the corpse of the officers was...

446
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,560
I remembered it.

447
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:07,060
This morning, this is the soldier who was killed by the warrior who tried the assassination.

448
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,150
 It's a very fast sword but... 

449
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,430
 What's wrong? 

450
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,380
 What is this? 

451
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:32,170
It is the same mark as the one we found in the corpse of Pandosa  and Kim Song Hwak.

452
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,140
Then it is the same guy who is the criminal who killed the land surveyors.

453
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,710
This guy...

454
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,550
We are thoroughly searching Goon Myo Mountain so we will find him.

455
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,850
We definitely have to capture him and find out his identity.

456
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,960
Uh, when I was fighting him, I asked for his name.

457
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,920
He wouldn't tell me.

458
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,040
Only then can I build my records...

459
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,680
Who is going to know if he only tells me his surname?

460
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,690
He said something like Goksan's Chukga or Chuksan's Gokgan, anyway.

461
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,910
I was dumbfounded.

462
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,120
What is it?

463
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,680
What did you just say?

464
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,560
Did he said he was Cheok from Goksan?

465
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,590
Yes.

466
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,100
If he is from the family of Goksan's Cheok,

467
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,740
then there is only one.

468
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,880
Then do you mean he is the descendant of Cheok Joon Gyung?

469
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:29,170
No way. That guy who was only spoken through rumors among martial arts families, to his father?

470
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,350
Rumors among the martial families?

471
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,210
Cheok Joon Gyung's Goksan sword style was inherited to his descendants and

472
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:41,090
Cheok Sa Gwang from this fourth generation has revived that sword style. There is a rumor like that.

473
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,890
It was a story from ten years ago, but—

474
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,890
Is he someone who's that famous?

475
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,670
A person of that caliber was going after the general.

476
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,730
We definitely have to catch him and prepare for the future.

477
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,970
It is the Goksan sword style.

478
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,630
That sword mark on the official's corpse was

479
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,490
from the Goksan's sword style.

480
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,400
How can I forget that, you stupid.

481
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,100
Goksan sword style.

482
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,290
I was a servant under that family a long time ago.

483
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,700
The Cheok Family.

484
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,040
Cheok (surname).

485
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,760
 Cheok Joon Gyung's descendant Cheok Sa Gwang. 

486
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,570
 One of my students was killed by that person. 

487
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:27,010
 I really wanted to have a duel with him once 

488
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,630
 but it seems like I'm going without seeing him. 

489
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,460
Then, are you saying the officers were killed by Cheok Sa Gwang?

490
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,900
From looking at the sword mark, there is a high possibility.

491
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,530
I have the ship ready.

492
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,890
Tonight, you just have to leave from the Yang Jin Port.

493
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,990
You worked hard.

494
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,940
If you pass Mount Goon Myo, you will arrive before the sun rises.

495
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,750
Hurry up.

496
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:00,810
Let's go.

497
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,730
Yes, Your Highness.

498
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,190
He is running away because he does not want to become the king?

499
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,200
I can't believe there is someone like him.

500
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,390
That is probably better, for his life.

501
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,470
To get on a boat, they said he is going to the Yang Jin Port.

502
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,750
He will probably pass over the Mount Goon Myo.

503
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,070
Teacher Yuk San went there personally.

504
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:32,000
Then, he will probably use that method again.

505
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,960
That method?

506
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,790


507
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,980
The man, Jo Young Gyu, or something, said to only capture that man.

508
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,550
That nobleman is with him all the time.

509
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,220
What should we do?

510
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,840
Elder!

511
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,030
- Your Highness
- Elder!

512
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,620
Your Highness.

513
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,710
What is it?

514
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,960
It is a poison dart.

515
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,930
Your Highness, come to your senses.

516
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,420
Your Highness.

517
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,050
Elder.

518
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,230
Water.

519
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,250
Please give me some water.

520
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,450
Yes, Elder.

521
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,480
Your Highness, are you okay?

522
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,070
It's cho poison.

523
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,110
We need licorice and bangpoong (herb used for poison) this instant. .

524
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,780
What is happening? Who shot the poison dart?

525
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,410
Let's attack right now.

526
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,860
It's one girl, and one injured.

527
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,250
We only have to get that man.

528
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,870
Don't we have to quickly escort him to the doctor?

529
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:06,670
That cannot be done. If we move right now, the poison will spread throughout his body faster.

530
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,770
The antidote is here.

531
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,770
This is the antidote.

532
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,630
You will probably die in one hour.

533
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,070
But you will live if you drink this.

534
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,410
Who in the world are you? Why are you doing this?

535
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,170
Then hurry up and give us the antidote.

536
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,130
Of course, I'll give it to you.

537
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:47,270
But I have one condition.

538
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,060
What is it?

539
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,970
Your Highness,

540
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:59,790
become this country's king and save Goryeo.

541
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,190
Who are you?

542
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:08,350
We have been called different names for the past hundred years.

543
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:13,790
Among the royal family, I have heard that we were known as the Nameless.

544
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,890
You guys are the...

545
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,820
We did not make that but that is a great name.

546
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,360
To be honest, we never really had a name.

547
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,100
If you are really the Nameless, then why are you doing this?

548
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:40,800
This is old and it's dark so it would be hard to see

549
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,940
but this is from when King Taejo defeated Gung Ye and established Goryeo.

550
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,660
This is the document the states that he made an alliance with us with his blood signature.

551
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:57,750
Since then, we have had deep relationships with the royal family.

552
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,450
So what? That has no nothing to do with me.

553
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,740
It will have something to do with you from now on.

554
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,390
If you, Prince Jeong Chang, becomes the king,

555
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:20,100
even in the future, we will help out so that the government will be in peace.

556
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:25,300
It doesn't end there. If that happens,

557
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,730
the ones who are against you

558
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:31,440
will also be our enemies, so

559
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,610
we will get rid of them all.

560
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,680
You tried to run away.

561
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,290
If you give up the throne and try to run away,

562
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,140
in the end, Lee Seong Gye will become the king and

563
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,840
if that happens, your sons and daughters, your brothers

564
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,200
and the other people who are part of the royal family

565
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,100
will all be killed.

566
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,670
Your Highness, if you decide to become the king drink this antidote and

567
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:17,050
if you do not like that then just spill this on the floor.

568
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:25,700
Then we will also throw away Goryeo and will look for another country.

569
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,200
Then...

570
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,850
Drink this quickly.

571
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,890
Hurry up.

572
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:01,510
Your Highness.

573
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,360
If I drink this,

574
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,580
I will become Nameless' King.

575
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,040
I do not know such things like that.

576
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,940
You just have to live.

577
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,350
If you die, I will also die.

578
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,470
Yoon Rang.

579
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,250
You probably do not know

580
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,770
what world

581
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,830
will open to me for drinking this.

582
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,650
Please, Your Highness.

583
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:53,220
You are not someone who must die in the mountains like this, My Lord.

584
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,030
They have appeared.

585
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,670
It's on the east side of Mount Goon Myo.

586
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:05,320
That Cheok guy attacked several men who were in search of him and fled.

587
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,090
Concentrate more soldiers around that area.

588
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:12,770
And also, even if he is injured, you cannot let your guard down for an opponent like him.

589
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,680
Send Moo Hyul and Lee Bang Ji.

590
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,230
Yes.

591
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,300
Will he drink it?

592
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,290
If he does not drink it, he will die.

593
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,120
If that happens, things will get complicated.

594
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,230
Teacher, after Cheok failed in his assassination attempt, he is hiding somewhere on this mountain.

595
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:35,890
Therefore, the Ga Byeol Cho are after him. Should I move some men and get him out?

596
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,080
Just let him be.

597
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,760
If he comes back alive by himself, I'll use him well

598
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,350
but if he doesn't then we'll have to throw him out.

599
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,130
Let's go.

600
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,270
There is not much time.

601
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:01,350
Please drink this and think about things after.

602
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,660
She's right, Elder.

603
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,690
Please just drink this first and think about it.

604
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,010
Yes.

605
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:14,270
You must live first so we can think of what to do after.

606
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,630
Please drink this, Your Highness.

607
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,780
After that.

608
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:25,080
After that, I will be their puppet king

609
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:31,780
and I will slowly and powerlessly die.

610
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,520
No.

611
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,430
After you replenish your body, if you wish to run away again then you can do that.

612
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,680
Why do we have to follow what they are saying?

613
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:51,910
They are probably on guard  in different parts of Mount Goon Myo.

614
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,520
Where can we go?

615
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,840
No.

616
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:06,320
If you wish to go, we can cross over this mountain and go anywhere you desire.

617
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,060
It's the east side of Mount Goon Myo.

618
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,320
During the search, they found Cheok Sa Gwang but he killed several men and fled.

619
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,310
What? Cheok Sa Gwang?

620
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,680
What do you mean by Cheok Sa Gwang?

621
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,250
That guy we fought before, he is Cheok Sa Gwang.

622
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,910
Didn't you say you were a servant in that family? Do you know him?

623
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,510
I do know him.

624
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:38,230
- It was a long time ago but...
- Let's go together, we have to make sure it's him.

625
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,860
It's here!

626
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:21,560
He has lost too much blood. If we captured him, we could have found out more information.

627
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,040
It seems like your attack was fatal after all.

628
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,980
I wanted to finish our duel.

629
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:31,470
Well, he was finished off by your attack, so it is the same as you winning.

630
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,220
He said he knows Cheok Sa Gwang's face.

631
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,190
Check it.

632
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:43,930
I saw it so long ago, but if I see it I'll probably be able to tell.

633
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,360
It can't be done. Let's just attack.

634
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,850
We only need to avoid hurting that nobleman, right?

635
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,600
You're right.

636
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,460
This won't do, Elder.

637
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,890
It seems like the time is almost done.

638
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,400
Hurry up and drink some of this.

639
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,070
This man is not Cheok Sa Gwang.

640
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:38,590
What? He's not?

641
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:41,050
Hey, you said you saw him like ten years ago.

642
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,920
Look thoroughly. How can you tell just by glancing like this.

643
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,960
Whether I look thoroughly or not, if I just look at him, it's not him.

644
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,540
Why?

645
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,070
Because Cheok Sa Gwang is a girl.

646
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:56,310
What was it that I just saw right now?

647
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,890
Drink this for now.

648
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:07,450
I'll tell you everything.

649
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:12,550
Did you also deceive me?

650
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,230
I did not deceive you.

651
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,300
Just... Just.

652
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,910
Just what?

653
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,130
Living while wielding a sword

654
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,990
and killing people, I hated it

655
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,380
so I could not tell you.

656
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,290
There were no other intentions.

657
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,470
Who are you?

658
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,120
I'm asking who you are.

659
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,110
I had a different name a long time ago.

660
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,680
Cheok Sa Gwang.

661
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,310
 During my youth, I have killed someone. 

662
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:06,560
 That Cheok Sa Gwang disappeared after killing a swords master from China.  

663
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,350
Cheok Sa Gwang is a girl?

664
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,040
No matter how long it was, do you think I can't tell the difference between a girl and a boy?

665
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,550
No, then who is this person?

666
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,990
Goodness.

667
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,290
Do you know who he is? Is he someone you know?

668
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:31,330
This man seems to be Cheok Sa Gwang's older brother.

669
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:38,590
Then, is Cheok Sa Gwang alive?

670
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,020
I am going to protect you.

671
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,250
Although living  while wielding a sword is devastating,

672
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,020
I will do that.

673
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,560
If I can be of help to you,

674
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,560
I will fight together with you.

675
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:03,640
Therefore, hurry.

676
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,980
Hurry up and drink it.

677
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:16,710
 Cheok Joon Gyung's Goksan sword style's last successor - Cheok Sa Gwang 

678
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:40,850


679
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,840
 Preview 

680
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,290
 Why do you think that happened? 

681
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,670
 Something is going on, whether it's a plan or someone is tricking someone. 

682
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,840
 What do you mean Prince Jeong Chang? 

683
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,860
 He will try to convince Po Eun. 

684
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:58,210
 If Po Eun or Prince Jeong Chang is Nameless, what if they are playing around with us? 

685
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,670
 Then at mid-month do you want to have a drink at Jangyeongak? 

686
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,710
 Yes, that sounds good. 

687
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,630
 The answers won't come out by us chasing Nameless. We have to make them show up. 

688
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,810
 Maeng Do Chil Yak, what is this one about? 

689
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,190
 Should we try to get in contact? 

690
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,980
 You are Lee Bang Won. 

691
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,890
 So you've shown up, Nameless.
