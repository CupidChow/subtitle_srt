 This program was created with the support of 
Ministry of Culture, Sports, &amp; Tourism, Korea

3
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,650
 Episode 2 

4
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,250
Just this once. Please let it go this one time.

5
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:03,500
In the future, when I tell you to come, you have to come. If I tell you to go, you have to go.

6
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,950
Attack the Japanese pirates when I tell you and let them go when I tell you so.

7
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,990
Constantly prove your loyalty to Goryeo and me.

8
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,310
You must be tired so you can go now.

9
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,380
General Lee.

10
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,700
I told you to show your respect to me as well.

11
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,870
How did you know?

12
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,520
There is nothing I don't know about.

13
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,050
Even what you are thinking inside,
 (Lee In Gyeom) 

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,720
I can see right through it.

15
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,550
 Lee Bang Won 

16
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,660
What was that earlier?

17
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,180
Lee In Gyeom knows everything about Jung Nang and "the dog that bites its owner".

18
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,490
How could they know about what was told to me?

19
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,410
The late General Lee Ja Choon and you are the only ones who know about it. Am I wrong?

20
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,780
Brother!

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,190
Oh my... Who could this be? It's Young Master!

22
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,920
You are an evil person.

23
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,110
Is that so? Then...

24
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,980
Is General Lee, your father, a virtuous man?

25
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,640
Yes! My father is a virtuous man!

26
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,010
Yes...

27
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,680
You are right. I saw him when I talked to him earlier,

28
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,740
and he was a very virtuous man.

29
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,950
He has to continue being virtuous.

30
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:08,330
General and you... You can do that, right?

31
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,570
This is...

32
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,710
Killing Jo So Saeng, who was like a brother to him,

33
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,660
and opening the gate for the great objective of Goryeo...

34
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,100
What is evil, and what is virtuous?

35
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:46,570
Is a human being  evil or virtuous by nature?

36
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,220
What are you doing there, not going in?

37
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,300
Father.

38
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,740
We will be going back to Hamjoo tomorrow. Go and make preparations.

39
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:23,240
 That's right, especially after having that conversation with me earlier, he is really good. 

40
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,390
Why are you blankly staring like that? Hurry and go inside.

41
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,490
Father!

42
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,980
Father, why didn't you save my poor helpless friends?

43
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:52,260
♫  Sword dance and watching flower blossoms in Dohwajeon
(Dohwajeon: Lee In Gyeom's residence) 

44
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:00,540
♫  The flowing melody is surely cheerful 

45
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,870
♫  All the great works for the past 500 years 

46
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,160
In my dream,
 Ddang Sae (Later Lee Bang Ji) 

47
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,380
I heard Mother's song again.

48
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,580
The troops are eating now. We have to follow them out. 
 (Boon Yi) 

49
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,310
Mother's song that we were singing has the wrong tune.

50
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,790
No one knows that song!

51
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,200
If we sing it properly, there will be someone who knows it.

52
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,630
The one who knows the song also knows Mother. For sure—

53
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,390
They're coming! They're coming! Hide!

54
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,600
Aigoo. Sit down! Sit down!

55
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,220
Eat a lot while you can!

56
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,080
We won't get to eat properly until we're done serving the envoys from Yuan. Go ahead and eat.

57
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,450
  Yes! 

58
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,510
Let's hide there.

59
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,900
What are we going to do if we get caught?

60
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,520
Do you want to die?

61
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,070
We have to go so we don't get caught.

62
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,270
This came again. Just like that one night.

63
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,370
When did this come again?

64
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,250
A few days ago—that night when I was worried about Lee Seong Gye coming.

65
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:18,290
As if it knew about my worry, that appeared on top of my table in my room.

66
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,900
Were the contents of the play in here?

67
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:29,350
This is not my scheme. Making Lee Seong Gye surrender and sending him back to Hamjoo was someone else, not me.

68
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,830
Therefore...

69
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,900
This is not my victory but someone else's.

70
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,290
Just like that night.

71
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:47,430
I am Eunuch Kim Nae Pyung. 
There has been a big problem in the palace
 (1374, Lee In Gyeom's house) 

72
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,280
Here...

73
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,930
 Just now, Noble Guard Hong Ryoon has assassinated the King 

74
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,720
Summon the soldiers now! We have to go to the palace right now.

75
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,800
Pardon? To the palace, sir?

76
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,570
Finally, that bastard Hong Ryoon

77
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,260
murdered His Majesty!

78
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,330
I will hurry back to the palace and leave the gate open.

79
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,260
Go ahead.

80
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,180
Arrest Hong Ryoon! Arrest the traitor!

81
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,580
Although I loved His Majesty, 
  (Hong Ryoon, head of the Royal Guards) 

82
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,450
I killed him for his high treason, and I plan to establish justice today!

83
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:18,070
His Majesty favored you the most! Do you think you will survive after killing your master?

84
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,450
Gil Tae Mi.

85
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,950
We should find out who is the best swordsman. Right, Hong Ryoon?

86
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,010
If I lose just let that guy go.

87
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:13,530


88
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,850
  Lee In Gyeom 

89
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,610
I did it.

90
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,170
I am now

91
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,910
the best swordsman.
 (Gil Tae Mi) 

92
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,870
Well done!

93
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,350
We seized the north and south Gates!

94
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,690
What about Kim Nae Pyung?

95
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,890
There is no such person.

96
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,130
What?

97
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,210
There is no such person anywhere, even in the office of eunuchs.

98
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,170
There never was such a person.

99
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,770
What?  He doesn't exist?

100
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,910
 Who on earth are you? 

101
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,130
 And why are you helping me? 

102
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,670
 We can't just rely on Lee Seong Gye. 

103
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,490
 War has to be stopped.
(Sambong Jeong Do Jeon) 

104
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,050
 I will stop it. 

105
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,870
Scholars are preparing for a government meeting tomorrow.

106
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,670
Teacher, you should go too.

107
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,130
I'm not going.

108
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,470
Teacher. Shouldn't we all gather our strength and prevent this war from happening?

109
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,550
Yes, we should prevent the war.

110
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,810
Do you want to participate?

111
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,950
Of course!

112
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,950
Then, tomorrow...

113
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,690
I might yell something out at Jangpyeong Gate.

114
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,930
At that time, you can just scream in the same way.

115
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,350
Pardon?

116
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,530
What?!

117
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,830
General Lee Seong Gye has declined the position as the head of the faction

118
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,010
and is going back to Hamjoo.

119
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,010
Why? Why, all of a sudden?

120
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,870
Sam Bong was right. He said not to trust General Lee.
 (Hong In Bang) 

121
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,170
This can't happen. I will meet General Lee myself.
 (Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo) 

122
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,390
I can't let the envoys from Yuan come through Jangpyeong Gate tomorrow.
 (Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo) 

123
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,930
Is Jung Geum outside?

124
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,830
  Yes! 

125
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,410
I need to find Sam Bong.

126
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,610
I will head over to Sam Bong's house. Go look for him in other places.

127
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,490
What did you say?

128
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,610
General Lee Seong Gye declined the minister's position and is heading to Hamjoo.

129
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,390
Is that true? We're in big trouble.

130
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,990
If it's like this, isn't it a given that we'll establish diplomatic ties with the Yuan?

131
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,550
No one from the Sadaebu (scholar officials) is stepping up to greet them.

132
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,710
This won't do. First, I should go see Po Eun.

133
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,650
I will go see Lord Gyung Bok Heung.

134
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,550
What do we do about the greeter?

135
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,370
Everyone, including Sadaebu and other officials, is adamant about not becoming the greeter!

136
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:08,650
Are you thinking of doing it yourself, Elder?

137
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,670
With no dignity?

138
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,230
Do you want to give it a try?

139
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,590
Don't I have another task?

140
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,950
Please tell me.

141
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,930
Just who is the greeter?

142
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,870
Sam Bong, are you there?

143
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,190
Father has not come home yet.

144
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,130
Do you not know where he went?

145
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,530
No, please come in and wait for him.

146
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,830
You! Weren't you meeting Minister Gyung Bok Heung?
 (Woo Hak Joo: Sadaebu scholar) 

147
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,130
 Everyone! Let's go!
(Han Goo Young: Sadaebu scholar) 

148
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,850
You said you'd be meeting Po Eun.

149
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,030
You can help me?

150
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,230
Why? Why are you here now?

151
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,610
If a relationship with Yuan is unavoidable,

152
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:35,390
as member of Sadaebu, I can let go of my personal stubbornness and do what is necessary.

153
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,950
But!

154
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,450
If you take care of the matter on your own like right now,

155
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,190
it will also be hard for us nobles to cooperate with you.

156
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,430
Will you be able to help me?

157
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,930
Do you have a card to deal? I don't think you do now.

158
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,050
You should have done so before Lee Seong Gye declined.

159
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,910
Tell us honestly.

160
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,510
You haven't found a greeter yet.

161
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:17,190
You're probably not thinking of sending a soldier who doesn't know courtesy as the greeter.

162
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:23,710
Since nobody from the Sadaebu has volunteered, weren't you still not able to send an official appointment letter?

163
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,390
I have a greeter.

164
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,750
I received the royal seal from His Majesty and sent an appointment letter. It's also not a soldier.

165
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,950
What kind of noble would go into that position?

166
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,310
Say it yourself.

167
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,730
Seriously, these people.

168
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,110
Goodness. Should I tell you both...

169
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,030
The greeter who will welcome the envoys from Yuan is...

170
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,010
 The greeter. The one who took on the greeter role is... 

171
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,710
The greeter is...

172
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,070
Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon!

173
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,090
Did you find Sam Bong?

174
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,290
Yes. I did find him, but...

175
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,070
Where is he? Let's go.

176
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,670
Yes.

177
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,470
Bandits!

178
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,390
 Hurry! 

179
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,770
What about greeting envoys from Yuan?

180
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,530
 Who can think about the envoys of Yuan at a time like this... 

181
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,670
We'll finish up and head over there.

182
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,050
 Stop right there! Let's go! 

183
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,250
Sam Bong! Where are you, Sam Bong?

184
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,190
Sam Bong!

185
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,350
Why are you here?

186
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,370
What are you doing here?

187
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,590
I came here knowing you're the greeter for the Yuan envoys.

188
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,270
I have to stop the war.

189
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,310
How can you prevent the relationship with Yuan, as well as a war, by becoming a greeter?

190
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,210
If you ask that question loudly at Jangpyeong Gate tomorrow, I will give you an answer.

191
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,230
What? What did you...

192
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,170
Are you planning to kill the envoys when you go there as a greeter?

193
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,790
Is that your first thought too?

194
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,090
Is it possible that you'd look for advancement through Prime Minister?

195
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,210
I have to stop the war no matter what.

196
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,090
Then, I will do it with you.

197
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,490
You were right again this time. Lee Seong Gye went back.

198
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,810
Some time ago, I asked you to help me when my words turned out to be correct.

199
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,070
But this is not the right time.

200
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,510
Not the right time?

201
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,530
Depending on what happens tomorrow, my life or death is unclear.

202
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,390
So please be safe and continue with my plan.

203
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,210
Your plan?

204
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,630
Lee In Gyeom, Baek Yoon, and Gyung Bok Heung...

205
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,550
Although their unity seems solid, they only came together for profit.

206
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,350
Their alliance will eventually crack.

207
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,930
So...

208
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,210
Wait for the right time and kill Baek Yoon.

209
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,250
When that happens,  Gyung Bok Heung and Lee In Gyeom will suspect each other as the killer.

210
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,230
Once suspicion starts, it will be unstoppable and there will be

211
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,730
grand internal strife.

212
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,890
"Pick up a stone, and hit a stone."

213
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,850
Kill Baek Yoon by using the plan, "Pick up a stone, and hit a stone,"

214
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,490
and this rotten Goryeo will end.

215
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,840
In other words, it's  Pyeongjeong Jigye. 

216
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,060
 Pyeongjeong Jigye: A plan to bring peace into the world 

217
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,280
Boon Yi! Boon Yi!

218
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,840
Those two men...

219
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,840
Please save me.

220
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,770
Who are you, and what were you doing here?
 (Lee Eun Chang: a Shinjin scholar, Jeong Do Jeon's private guard) 

221
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,590
What did you hear?

222
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,160
I don't know.

223
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,870
I'm just

224
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,510
looking for my mother.

225
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,850
Please untie me.
 (Ddang Sae, Future Lee Bang Ji) 

226
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,940
My sister's waiting for me.

227
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,130
Please untie me!

228
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,700
When the sun rises, hunters will come to collect their traps.

229
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,210
Until then, you must stay in this place.

230
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,820
Some kid was there so, I tied him up inside.

231
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,320
I will release him in the morning.

232
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,750
Twenty-nine years of war with Yuan,

233
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,610
and the endless invasions by Red Turban and foreign forces.

234
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,440
We can no longer drive our nation and our people into the pit of hell.

235
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,180
Today, at Jangpyeong Gate, we will change history.

236
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,110
The great Goryeo, hurray!

237
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,540
The great Goryeo, hurray!

238
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,420
Hurry and find Sam Bong!

239
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,800
Gather every available hand, and you must find the high scholar Sam Bong at all cost!

240
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,710
  Yes! 

241
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,850
Do search thoroughly among the Shinjin and
 Confucius scholars who followed him,

242
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,750
and even down to his family servants to find Jeong Do Jeon.

243
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,780
  Yes! 

244
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,210
  -You go that way! 
 -Yes! 

245
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,110
That ungrateful and immoral wretch.

246
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,810
He'd dare volunteer to be a greeter to satisfy his aspiration for distinction?

247
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,220
Myeong Jeong.

248
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,370
General Lee Seong Gye is refusing to meet us.

249
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,270
Sam Bong is the greeter.

250
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,730
 Po Eun (personal name - Jeong Mong Joo) 

251
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,710
What...?

252
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,430
Sam Bong. Sam Bong wouldn't do that.

253
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,020
Of course, he wouldn't.

254
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,910
What is Sam Bong going to do?

255
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,480
He is going to kill the Yuan envoy.

256
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,040
I agree with Sam Bong's will.

257
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,970
Myeong Jeong!

258
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,170
There's no other way now.

259
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,250
Myeong Jeong!

260
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,030
Don't you see?  Why do you only consider the reason Sam Bong volunteered to be the greeter

261
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,850
and not concern yourself with the reason Lee In Gyeom has appointed Sam Bong as the greeter?

262
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,660
Do you think Lee In Gyeom doesn't know Sam Bong?

263
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,050
Could it be...

264
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,450
It's a trap. It's Lee In Gyeom's trap.

265
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,850
No...

266
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,560
What a treat. I get to play at being the Yuan Envoy.

267
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,110
Do you think Sam Bong will move as you want him to, Elder?

268
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,290
  Lee In Gyeom 

269
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,060
Through Lee Eun Chang, Sam Bong has

270
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,800
secretly gathered many Confucius scholars.

271
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,570
Besides, there is report of rebellion.

272
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,470
He will do as we predict.

273
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,090
Ha! Sam Bong!  And for him to have acted as if he were the only smart one around!
 (Gil Tae Mi) 

274
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,240
And he hasn't a clue that the Yuan Envoy is still in the frontier...!

275
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,810
When Sam Bong initiates his plan, arrest him immediately.

276
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,860
And by using the state investigation, Jeong Mong Joo, Hong In Bang, Lee Saek

277
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,740
and the names of all the Shinjin scholars who followed them must be revealed in their entirety!

278
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,240
That man, Sam Bong, has accepted the greeter's appointment for his own personal glory.

279
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,850
I did hear that, but do you really believe it is something Sam Bong would do?

280
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,170
Do you really think that way?

281
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,010
This wretch is a caretaker of the Lee Eun Chang household.

282
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,540
Repeat exactly what you said earlier.

283
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,210
It is true that this humble servant has delivered a letter to the Yuan Envoy in the frontier.

284
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,190
However, I truly do not know the content of the letter, Sirs.

285
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,120
It wasn't enough that he schemed his way to be the greeter, but he was already in cahoots with the envoy as well.

286
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,780
Will you still protect Sam Bong?

287
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,610
Take a look at yourselves.  Just how far will you go to satisfy your greed for power?

288
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,150
That's not it.

289
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,140
He's going to kill him?!

290
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,370
No way. No way.

291
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,420
He'd murder the Yuan envoy in order to prevent diplomacy from being established...

292
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,700
Danger can befall all of us Shinjin scholars!

293
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,220
We have to stop it.

294
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,130
This is Lee In Gyeom's plan. He's probably anticipating it.

295
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,130
Where is Sam Bong?

296
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,710
That...

297
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,760
Please tell us. We have to stop Sam Bong!

298
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,090
Why are you not going home?

299
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,020
Ah, leave! Just go home!

300
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,930
  Lee Bang Won 

301
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,320
I told you I'm going to be a beggar now.

302
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,840
What beggar-like nonsense are you spewing?

303
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,780
He's not even moving. Are you not going away?

304
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,580
Leader, Leader!

305
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,180
You have to help me!

306
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,610
My brother was caught!

307
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,490
Which den of beggars was it? I will quickly—

308
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,010
That's not it.

309
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,710
The warriors.

310
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,510
Warriors?

311
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:44,230
Yes, but... Leader, listen to me.

312
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,750
Do you know me?

313
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,910
Leader!

314
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,290
Let go!

315
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,400
Don't you know that you're not supposed to get involved in such places?

316
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,110
Alright,

317
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,680
ask that guy.

318
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,830
He said his father is an amazing person,

319
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,830
that his father is a big shot.

320
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,210
 If I tell my father, everything here will end in one shot. 

321
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,850
Help me.

322
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,180
You said that if you tell your father, he can help release Gab Boon's mother, right?
 (Boon Yi) 

323
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,430
Tell your father and save my brother, okay?

324
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,600
We have to hurry and tell your father—

325
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,680
Let's not talk about my father.

326
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,910
It's a lie, right?

327
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,830
That your father is a great and mighty person.

328
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,930
They are all lies, right?

329
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,790
No.

330
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,860
Then why can't you help me?

331
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,980
When you asked for it, we helped you.

332
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,160
You said that just by telling your father, they can all be punished.

333
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,760
So, you have to help me!

334
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,710
I can't.

335
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,370
Admit that you are lying then.

336
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,210
You're lying, right?

337
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,380
I'm right! You are lying!

338
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,980
Then, admit it.

339
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,310
Your father is not a great person but a pathetic one.

340
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,360
He's so weak that he can't even save one boy.

341
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,460
He's a coward!

342
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,560
Don't say that about my father!

343
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,210
You hit me? So, you're the same as your father!

344
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,770
A lie maker...

345
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,750
to your father.

346
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,350
He has no power.

347
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,080
My father...

348
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,090
I thought he is the strongest man

349
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,430
but he isn't the strongest.

350
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:19,010


351
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,010
Then what do I do? Your father should have been strong.

352
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,470
How am I supposed to help my brother?!

353
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,710
In Gaegyeong, there's no one whom I can trust other than you.

354
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,430
After Mom disappeared, I've been scared to death that I will lose my brother too.

355
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,810
If your father doesn't have the power, then what am I supposed to do?

356
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,270
They've got about ten people.

357
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,430
Don't be like that and just tell General.

358
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,200
I already said I'm not telling Father!

359
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,970
Don't you have any self-confidence?

360
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,440
- It's not that.
- If you think you aren't up to saving a little boy

361
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,400
then quit (being a man).

362
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,980
What? Shut up!

363
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,750
Those pubescent Gagyeong pups!  NO PROBLEM!

364
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,320
Don't worry. Even if he's like that,

365
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,800
he is the second strongest punk after Bang Woo Hyung in Hamjoo.

366
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,750
You can trust him.

367
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,870
Let's go.

368
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,240
The Confucian scholars are probably at the Jangpyeong Gate already. Let's go.

369
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,910
What are you doing? Who are you?

370
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,670
It's me.

371
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,020
What's the matter?

372
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,250
At first I thought that you were an ambitious scholar who attached himself to the chief of the academy

373
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,260
in order to seize the chance to advance yourself.

374
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,010
However,

375
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,360
what childlike fervor for victory is this? 
 (Woo Hak Joo, Shinjin scholar) 

376
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,140
How can a scholar who studied Confucius commit deeds that would derail the teachings?

377
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,580
I guess your desire to take a position within the Do Dang

378
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,490
by doing a nice trade with Lee In Gyeom
 (Do Dang: the highest state affairs organization at the end of Goryeo dynasty) 

379
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,110
has come to naught?

380
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,290
Squash them!

381
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,230
Stop.

382
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,890
I heard that your maternal grandmother is a slave's daughter who screwed a fake monk,

383
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,520
It seems that those rumors are true.

384
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,640
Do you think the Prime Minister will be outmatched by the likes of you?
 (Su Shi Joong/Prime Minister: Lee In Gyeom's office title) 

385
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,730
It is a trap, a strategy to strike against Shinjin scholars!

386
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,210
Tie him up tightly!

387
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,730
The two of you must keep watch here.

388
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,360
Yes.

389
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,840
You men...
 (Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo) 

390
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,650
Do not think to release him, Sir.

391
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,060
- Sam Bong!
- Master!

392
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,460
Master Po Eun!

393
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,910
Please untie us.

394
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,270
Hurry.

395
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,150
Didn't you agree that preventing the war was of the utmost importance?

396
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,770
Of course, I do. Of course.

397
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,410
Then you have to untie us.

398
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,760
I can prevent it.  I have a plan!

399
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,260
It's not something that you can end by yourself.

400
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:15,210
The entire fate of Shinjin scholars can rest on your one move.

401
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,030
- Hence, let us collect all of our thoughts and—
- Those are the people

402
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,570
who would permit a war to obtain a position within the Do Dang.

403
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,390
They are people who have allied with Lee In Gyeom.

404
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,100
More than half the people would willingly do that (be in league with Lee In Gyeom).

405
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,820
What will you do by making all of them your enemy?

406
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,890
What is your solution then?

407
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,220
I believe that if we were to gather the Shinjin scholars who have the same belief as we do,

408
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,160
and discuss this passionately, then send the letter of appeal...

409
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,440
We don't have time for that!

410
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,920
FINE!  Then what do you propose we do?

411
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,690
The Yuan envoy is already on his way.

412
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,090
Yes, the Yuan envoy is coming.

413
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,370
The Yuan envoy is on his way.

414
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,790
Is there anyone who doesn't know that?

415
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,310
They do not know.  You, Shinjin scholars, and even Lee In Gyeom do not know!

416
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,690
The only truth is that the Yuan envoy is on his way.

417
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,470
There are only two.

418
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,940
Nonsense!

419
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,100
Brother.

420
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,070
Even if you succeed, it's a path that you can't turn back from.

421
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,590
You might even lose your life.

422
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,250
At this rate where we might be in war with Ming, we will all die anyway.

423
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,030
Brother.

424
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,360
No one can predict the future.

425
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,850
Neither you nor I can tell the future if we are human beings.

426
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,400
I, a human who does not know the future,

427
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,610
for now, I have to save you.

428
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,260
Brother. Brother, please! Brother—

429
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,910
Damn it.

430
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,590
What do we do now?

431
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,170
Can you untie us? Try it.

432
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,070
  Is there anyone outside? Answer me. 

433
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,670
He's really loud.

434
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,750
Should I at least put a gag on him?
 Is anybody out there? 

435
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,370
 I have to stop the war. 

436
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,240
  Is there anyone outside? 

437
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,460
Who are these people?

438
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,960
Brother!

439
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,170
Are you hurt anywhere?

440
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,540
I'm fine.

441
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,960
That guy tied me up.

442
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,180
Please release us.

443
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,710
Please release—

444
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,240
Why? Why did you do it?!

445
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,260
Not that guy.

446
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,760
Why did you do it? Why did you do it?!

447
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,330
Please release us!

448
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,560
You must be kidding me!

449
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,120
I have to go.  I have to go so that we can block Lee In Gyeom, who is in league with Yuan,

450
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,710
and prevent the war!

451
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,420
How can these children understand those words?

452
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,570
I'm really sorry.

453
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,340
You know that we intended to release you when time had passed.

454
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,490
I will also give you something to eat.

455
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,270
I will also buy you dried persimmons. Have you tried them? They are really—

456
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,200
After capturing my scaredy-cat brother and scaring him,

457
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,360
Dried persimmons? Do you think we are beggars?

458
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,540
Is that true?

459
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,980
Do you think there is a way to stop Lee In Gyeom?

460
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,700
Hey, forget it! I'll stop him. Lee In Gyeom or whatever.

461
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,000
Can you really

462
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,210
win over Lee In Gyeom and stop the war?

463
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,810
I can stop it. Release me.

464
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,710
 What my father can't do, this ahjusshi will...
(Lee Bang Won) 

465
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,730
Can you promise me, man-to-man?

466
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,270
I promise.
 (Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon) 

467
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,290
What does that mean? What are you saying I did to Sam Bong?

468
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,210
I'm asking if you released Sam Bong.

469
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,610
Does that mean that Sam Bong disappeared?

470
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,250
This is not the time to be like this. We have to find Sam Bong.

471
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:27,290
Yuan's demand is utterly unreasonable.  We mustn't accept!
 (Jangpyeong Gate: Gate on northern part of the capital) 

472
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:33,470
Yuan's demand is utterly unreasonable.  We mustn't accept!

473
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:40,830
 Yuan's demand is utterly unreasonable.  We mustn't accept! 

474
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:48,190
 Yuan's demand is utterly unreasonable.  We mustn't accept! 

475
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,410
  What is going on? 

476
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,590
 Unhand me, Sir! 

477
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,690
 I said to let go! 

478
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,190
Po Eun, right there!

479
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,590
Sam Bong.

480
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,950
That crazy bastard.

481
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,570
No! You must not!

482
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,090
It's the person we saved.

483
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:38,190
He said he will stop the war.

484
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:25,550


485
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,090
The greeter attacked the Yuan envoy, Young Master.

486
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,930
I am not the Yuan envoy!

487
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,690
 What? He's not? 

488
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,470
I've disguised myself after receiving intelligence

489
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,110
that there was a villainous plan to assassinate the Yuan envoy.

490
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:28,830
This servant, Gil Tae Mi, as the Deputy Minister of Literature and Minister of Defense of the Great Goryeo,

491
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:34,230
am standing here, in order to ferret out the traitor who would disrupt the nation's peace

492
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,930
by assassinating the Yuan envoy.

493
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,930
What the...

494
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,150
It's not a knife. Taffy?

495
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:30,870
Look here, Prime Minister (Lee In Gyeom), you sure have worked hard to arrange a false Yuan envoy.

496
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:35,890
I, too, have prepared the "taffy" in order to greet the envoy.
 (Taffy = Yeot in Korean, is also used for telling someone to go f* oneself.) 

497
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,270
Just... Just why is he doing that?

498
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:51,870
Young Master, that man, I think he's crazy.

499
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,990
I, Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon.

500
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,170
What are you guys doing? Arrest all of them!

501
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,610
I, Jeong Do Jeon,

502
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,670
put my life in danger to show the whole world our righteous rage and intention

503
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:54,570
to kill the Yuan envoy when he appears here.

504
00:47:54,570 --> 00:48:00,390
If we go into a diplomatic relationship with the Yuan now, we'll have to go to war against Ming next year.

505
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,130
But the trio, including Prime Minister Lee In Gyeom,

506
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,610
is about to hold hands with Yuan for their own good.

507
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:16,010
Please don't! Oh no! We don't have diplomatic relations with Yuan.

508
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,590
They mobilize young students and make them plead in front and they negotiate in the back to expand their powers.

509
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:24,790
What on earth are the Sadaebu elders doing?

510
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,810
Is this a matter of negotiation?

511
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,250
 - I agree. 
- Yes. 

512
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:38,550
Wars shouldn't be determined by the  haves, 

513
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,610
because the only ones who die are people who are the  have-nots. 

514
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,490
War... can't be decided by the elders!

515
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,430
The only ones who die are the young.

516
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,170
Is it right for the child to hold a funeral for the father?

517
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,230
Or is it right for the father to hold a funeral for the child?

518
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:09,430
We've already held too many funerals with the hands of fathers.

519
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,570
 How will you stop the relationship with Yuan as well as a  war, if you're only a greeter? 

520
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,990
 If you yell out that question at Jangpyeong Gate tomorrow, I will answer your question. 

521
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:25,810
Then... How can you stop entering into a diplomatic relationship with Yuan?

522
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,650
We have to be strong and determined.

523
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,950
The Yuan envoy is already in Kanggye.

524
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:38,230
The Yuan envoy's comings and goings can't be decided by the government alone anymore.

525
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:40,790
So, what's the point of pleas and appeals?

526
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,070
We have to make the Yuan retreat on their own.

527
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:49,170
The one coming right now is not the powerful Yuan.

528
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:54,750
It's just one weak person who took the role of envoy of Yuan.

529
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:01,270
If we show our determination to kill him and make him run away,

530
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,890
we can prevent the war and a diplomatic relationship.

531
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,550
That might be the only way right now.

532
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,030
I am Seo In Chang, Deputy Commander of the envoy group.

533
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,190
How did you get here, Deputy Commander?

534
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:25,250
The Goryeo government sent a letter to Kanggye a few days ago.

535
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,250
 I would like to discuss the protocol 

536
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:41,230
 at the podium in front of Jangpyeong Gate, at two o'clock on September 5th. 

537
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:44,090
 Greeter, Jeong Do Jeon. 

538
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,130
As Jeong Do Jeon, the fifth generation of Jung from Bonghwa...

539
00:50:52,130 --> 00:51:00,540
As long as I am alive, I will make sure to chop off the head of the Yuan envoy, whomever he may be!

540
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,770
 I may yell out something in front of Jangpyeong Gate tomorrow. 

541
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:11,450
 I need you to yell out the same thing, just once. 

542
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:16,570
I, Heo Kang, the nineteenth generation of Heo from Youngil,

543
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:22,840
will chop off the head of the Yuan envoy who crosses the Jangpyeong Gate!

544
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:29,970
Here! And I too, will die! I swear! The 33rd generation of Park from Banam, Park Chan Yeon.

545
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:37,350
The Yuan envoy won't cross Jangpyeong Gate before he sees my blood being shed!

546
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:43,160
No one here will allow the entrance of the Yuan envoy!

547
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,290
We will offer our lives, and kill him!

548
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:49,080
 ...18th generation... also will... 

549
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,310
What's going on?

550
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,670
Young Master.

551
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:02,950
He's really preventing a war from happening, isn't he?

552
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:07,780
I, Woo Hak Joo, Woo from Daechon,

553
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:14,290
I will cut off the Yuan envoy's head and prevent war from happening!

554
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:19,200
I, Han Goo Young, Han from Gyeongpo,

555
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:25,440
will kill the Yuan envoy and protect Goryeo!

556
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,510
Po Eun, this is...

557
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:58,400
 No matter what kind of plan you have, share it with other people first. 

558
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,960
 No matter how right you are, you won't be able to do it alone. 

559
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,580
 I know very well. 

560
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:12,420
 But... No one listens to what I have to say. 

561
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,990
 Regardless of where it is, my words won't spread. 

562
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:26,880
 Brother, I need a stage. A stage where I can speak. 

563
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:33,620
 Was this it, Sam Bong? Did you get your stage? 

564
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:40,550
Sir... If anyone here yells out that the Yuan envoy is here...

565
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:51,710
What are you guys doing?! Start beating them!

566
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:10,400
Brother, let's go. Hurry!

567
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,170
Wait. That man...

568
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:20,540
If you get involved here, you'll be beaten to death. Let's hurry and leave!

569
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:36,810
I will report what I heard and saw just now to the Commander in Kanggye.

570
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:42,570
You can't leave like this. What are you so afraid of, as the Deputy Commander?

571
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,390
The great Yuan has nothing to fear!

572
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:50,850
But, we are merely human beings with only one life.

573
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,810
- Let's protect Teacher Sam Bong! 
- Protect him!

574
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:32,140
♫  Sword dance and flower-viewing  in Dohwajeon 

575

♫   The joyful melody is cheerful

579

♫   Children are torn and ripped by taxes 

580
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:25,880

00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,260
Young Master.

582

♫   Why is your cry so mournful?  ♫

587

♫   Nameless bird in the sky, why is your cry so mournful? ♫

  Six Flying Dragons
Preview 

595
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:15,210
 You shouldn't have done that alone. 

596
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,210
 You heard it right? It's definitely that song! 

597
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,750
 The one in there is our father! 

598
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:26,020
 Send Jeong Do Jeon into exile in secret and arrest all of the students who wrote the appeal! 

599
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,950
 The more you are confined, the more you should come alive! 

600
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:31,220
 I will go to Seonggyungwan. 

601
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,740
 What are you trying to do? 

602
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,560
 They are the ones who committed the evil act! 

603
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,840
 Good and evil? What's the use of it? 

604
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:46,730
 At least I want to be righteous rather than to be good. I cannot forgive them.
