3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,680
 Because Cheok Sa Gwang is a woman. 

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
I had a different name before.

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,640
Cheok Sa Gwang. I will protect you.

6
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,730
It disgusts me to live while using a sword,

7
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,250
but if I can be of help to you

8
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,250
I will fight with you.

9
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,780
So,

10
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,780
hurry.

11
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,620
Please drink this.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,410
Then, who is this person?

13
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,230
I think this person is Cheok Sa Gwang's older brother.

14
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,180
Are you sure?

15
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,320
Then, when he said he's Mr. Cheok of Gok San.

16
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,780
He is indeed a member of the Cheok family.
 (Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master) 

17
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,160
His name is probably Cheok In Gwang.

18
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,890
 To think that Yoon Rang is Cheok Sa Gwang... 

19
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,410
 I have to quickly report this. 

20
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,150
Your Highness.

21
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,690
Thank you.

22
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,990
Thank you for living.

23
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,230
I can't die
 (Wang Yo: Future 34th king of Goryeo) 

24
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,240
while leaving you behind.

25
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,920
Whether I live getting swung around by Lee Seong Gye

26
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,110
or live according to what those Nameless bastards dictate,

27
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,200
if it's a life where I can look at you, I have to live.

28
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,900
No. Even if I fight them and die doing so,

29
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,280
if I'm with you,

30
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,560
I'll try to live.

31
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,520
Then, I will escort you.

32
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,310
It's cold so if we stay here for a long time...

33
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,420
Just a moment, Warrior-nim.

34
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,950
When that Nameless person appeared,
 (Cheok Sa Gwang) 

35
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,830
you didn't even panic.

36
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,750
Why are you being like this?

37
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,730
Also, you were the one who knew this road. How did they know about it?

38
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,170
When Your Highness got hit by a poison dart,

39
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,610
even before you collapsed, he already screamed your name.

40
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,520
You don't seem to be one skilled enough to be able to see a thin dart flying in the dark.

41
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,160
What are you saying? I'm just...

42
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,130
Yoon Rang. Geun Soo has served me for a long time.

43
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,520
Still, Your Highness, I think it's strange.

44
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,610
That General Cheok Joon Kyung.

45
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,730
Didn't you say his family was massacred after he was framed as a traitor?

46
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,020
Ah, here you go.

47
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,440
About that. One son secretly survived,

48
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,290
and the one who taught his son

49
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,890
the swordsmanship of Gok San was Cheok Sa Gwang's grandfather.

50
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,870
So?

51
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,570
That man has two grandchildren.

52
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,030
One was Cheok In Gwang and the other was Cheok Sa Gwang.

53
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,420
Cheok In Gwang was really good and he was originally the heir.

54
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,380
Didn't you say that Cheok Sa Gwang was the heir?

55
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,170
Originally, it was Cheok In Gwang, but

56
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,480
he ran away from home in the middle of his training to go out and become famous.

57
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,520
Aigoo, that...

58
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,140
So the distressed elder taught his young granddaughter, Cheok Sa Gwang,

59
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,630
but that girl's talents

60
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,170
were like those of Gerenal Cheok Joon Kyung.

61
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,200
Oh my goodness. Do you mean that girl?

62
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,330
I didn't want to learn the swordsmanship.

63
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:24,280
Still, doing it with Grandfather made life interesting.

64
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,380
At least before that person came.

65
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,020
Who came?

66
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,490
About that.

67
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,870
Who could have gone to a house with only an old man and his granddaughter

68
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,910
to cause such an incident?

69
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,270
So about that.

70
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,720
Jang Sam Bong's disciple probably went there.

71
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,300
How did you know?

72
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,480
He said he came from China

73
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,620
in order to duel with Grandfather.

74
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,920
He fought with Grandfather

75
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,440
and Grandfather passed away.

76
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,540
And I,

77
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,880
without knowing, just...

78
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,290
 I'm sorry but he died while fighting with me. 

79
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,900
 This is a common thing among warriors. 

80
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,200
It must have been hard.

81
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,940
At such a young age, you became an orphan.

82
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,400
But more than that,

83
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,900
more than Grandfather's death,

84
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,290
it was harder for me because I killed a person.

85
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,470
I don't know how long I've trembled from nightmares.

86
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,970
I threw my sword right away

87
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,170
and never held one again.

88
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:25,690
But Your Highness, I who was like that, killed three people last night.

89
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,650
Still, I comfortably slept in Your Highness' embrace.

90
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,590
I will fight with you

91
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,190
so please, never show weakness again.

92
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,840
That Cheok In Gwang guy that died yesterday was very skilled as well. If I had dueled with him one-on-one...

93
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,250
Why would you duel with him!?

94
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,700
Moo Hyul, you must not have such thoughts.

95
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,700
How good is Cheok Sa Gwang?

96
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,830
Since she was born as a woman she probably has limitations,

97
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,360
but because she inherited the sword skill of Gok San...

98
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,830
The assassins didn't come back?

99
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,860
No. I was going to give them their payment after bringing Baek Geun Soo. But they never came back.

100
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,880
Something went wrong then.
 (Lee Bang Won) 

101
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,220
Where is Moo Hyul? Let's go there.

102
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,850
Just what happened here?

103
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,250
Why is Baek Geun Soo dead?

104
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,950
Who are those two people?

105
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:04,630
Did Geun Soo die while fighting those two or...
 (Jeok Ryong: Bi Guk Temple Head Monk) 

106
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,470
This is Gok San's swordsmanship.

107
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,290
Then, was it Mr. Cheok?
 (Yook San) 

108
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,180
But why would he? He's in the middle of running away in the mountains.

109
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,560
Why would he suddenly come and kill these... No way.

110
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,780
Prince Jeong Chang Wang Yo has gone home.

111
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,010
That's a relief.

112
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,650
Get rid of these corpses.

113
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,320
And you,

114
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
find out who ordered

115
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,700
these two assassins and what they were supposed to do.

116
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,830
Find out more about the sword mark.

117
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,530
Not even one of them came back?

118
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,130
They failed.

119
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,990
They died.

120
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,550
Since they failed, the payment is no more...

121
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,400
If you want, I can give you other guys.

122
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,120
Was Baek Geun Soo that strong?

123
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,090
I sent people who were a lot stronger than Baek Geun Soo.

124
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,380
You didn't switch the guys without me knowing, right?

125
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,080
We didn't do such a thing.

126
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,860
Other than Baek Geun Soo,

127
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,940
there was probably another skilled person there.

128
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,780
Didn't Nameless kill them?

129
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,650
That's right. Nameless probably interfered.

130
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,330
Did Nameless kill people again?

131
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,310
Yes, we think

132
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,660
that they killed the people we sent to catch Baek Geun Soo.

133
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,210
It's like a group of murderers.

134
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,160
Look at that face again.

135
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,210
Don't worry now because I'm doing it myself.

136
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,120
We can find her.

137
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,900
Why are you like that? Is it because of your mother?

138
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,270
- Our Mom wasn't kidnapped.
- What are you saying?

139
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,450
The code that your mom used with the Nameless member back then

140
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,210
worked?

141
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,960
Our Mom is a Nameless. She's a member of Nameless.

142
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,040
I didn't want to believe it but
 (Boon Yi) 

143
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,910
I am sure now.

144
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,560
Then,

145
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,750
about Gil Seon Mi meeting Ji Cheon Tae.

146
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,050
Did you come to know about this by using that?

147
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,590
But why are you only saying that now?

148
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,280
Mom

149
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,980
has become our enemy.

150
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,070
- I was scared.
- Hey, Leader Boon Yi.

151
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,070
Are you going to keep on being lifeless like this?

152
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:15,500
You have to see further down the road. If you are all tired and lifeless, then you are losing.

153
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,370
But why did you suddenly

154
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,090
get the urge to find Nameless?

155
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,140
You were only following Teacher Po Eun.

156
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,660
Teacher Sam Bong trusts Teacher Po Eun,

157
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,980
and Teacher Po Eun also thinks that this great cause is important.

158
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,150
I just decided to trust him as well.

159
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,940
I will definitely find Nameless.

160
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,110
So you should also

161
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,130
think of doing our job instead of other things.

162
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,130
About that Ji Cheon Tae, who could it be?

163
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm curious as well so I asked Unni Yeon Hee to check it out,

164
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,430
but she said that the people of Hwa Sa Dan also didn't know such name.

165
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,970
- I need to meet that person for now.
- Who?

166
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,140
Who is this?

167
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,810
I knew you would come find me someday.

168
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,210
No matter how you think about it, there's no one but me, right?

169
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,010
I didn't come here to joke around.

170
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,800
So why did you come?

171
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,060
Nameless.

172
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,490
The things that we know about Nameless,

173
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,570
how about sharing them to each other?

174
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,010
Those are things that were difficult for me to find out so why

175
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,860
would I share them with you?

176
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,010
- You'll eventually spill it anyway.
- Why do you think that?

177
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,830
Teacher Heo Jeong, you said that, because of Lord Lee In Gyeom's will,

178
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,670
you followed Nameless for a long time.

179
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,440
I don't think you are that kind of person.

180
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,060
Aren't you the type who can't stand being curious?

181
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,300
Aren't you?

182
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,500
That's right.

183
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,080
Yeah. It was that that I couldn't stand it.

184
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,670
Hap Ha has already passed away,

185
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,100
so I was wondering why I followed Nameless like an obsession.

186
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,980
That's right. I can't stand my curiosity.

187
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,930
What can't you stand?

188
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,980
Injustice. I can't stand injustice.

189
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,170
You probably have one more thing that you can't stand.

190
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,070
Then make guess on that too.

191
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,940
Being unable to do anything,

192
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,970
a feeling of helplessness.

193
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,100
You probably can never stand that.

194
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,120
 You won't be able to endure yourself being weak for a long time. 

195
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,970
- If you're only going to speak nonsense, I will go.
- Okay, okay.

196
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,870
Okay. What should we do?

197
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,870
How many places are there in Gaegyeong that do business with assassins?

198
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,650
About six or seven.

199
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,150
Two assassins were sent to Prince Jeong Chang. Find out who they were.

200
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,150
Yes, I understand.

201
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,920
So it was like that.

202
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,880
The Ji Cheonn Tae from Nameless

203
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,480
is probably from Bi Guk Temple or Hwa Sa Dan.

204
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,410
Nameless only gives the needed information to the person who needs it.

205
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,780
And they control that person by doing so.

206
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,300
Lord Lee In Gyeom was exactly that.

207
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,540
That's right.

208
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,890
They controlled power by using information.

209
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,380
In Gaegyeong, the ones who give out that kind of information

210
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,470
are in two places.

211
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,950
Hwa Sa Dan's Cho Young and Bi Guk Temple's Jeok Ryong.

212
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:13,210
Didn't you say that Cho Young pretended she didn't know the Nameless seal?

213
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,970
Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom probably asked her to find out Kim Nae Pyeong so many times.

214
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,790
It doesn't make sense for her not to know.

215
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,810
Also, during the Liaodong expedition, Bi Guk Temple's Jeok Ryong,

216
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,920
as a gift for our deal,

217
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,870
gave me secret information from General Choi Yeong.

218
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,710
He's not like that, right?

219
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,090
Totally not. Nothing is free with that person.

220
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,900
Thinking about it now,

221
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,160
he wanted us to stop General Choi Yeong

222
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,780
and purposely gave us the information.

223
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
Behind him,

224
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,050
don't you think that Nameless ordered him?

225
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,400
Is there really a Nameless between Choi Yeong and Jeok Ryong?

226
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,570
There was also that. Forging penmanship.

227
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,620
The one that was exactly the same as Woo Jae's writing.

228
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,780
- Wasn't there a letter that came like that?
- What about it?

229
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,890
Copying a letter that already existed

230
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,410
can take about an hour for a skilled person, but

231
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,040
when writing the content they want using the person's penmanship...

232
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,840
First, that person needs to study the penmanship.

233
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,450
A thousand characters or even ten thousand characters.

234
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,890
They have to practice using all of it written in the person's penmanship.

235
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,360
Training someone

236
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,820
to exactly copy penmanship like that

237
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,140
would take three years.

238
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,650
The organizations that can invest such time and people

239
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,090
are Bi Guk Temple and Hwa Sa Dan.

240
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,320
But Bi Guk Temple and Hwa Sa Dan are both

241
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,640
selling information for wealth.

242
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,140
Even so, they can still receive orders from Nameless.

243
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,370
Ji Cheon Tae. If that person is...

244
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,840
- If what?
- We can just confirm it.

245
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,030
- How?
- Hey! Look here! Hey!

246
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,930
He's so impatient.

247
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,500
- Nameless is probably curious to death now.
- About what?

248
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,600
About the assassins that we sent to catch Baek Geun Soo.

249
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,990
There's no way for them to know who sent them.

250
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,040
That's right. They won't even be able to imagine that it was Young Master who sent them.

251
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,710
Furthermore, they don't know whether the assassins were for Wang Yo or Baek Geun Soo.

252
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,960
They will be looking for the person who sent the assassins.
 (Jo Young Gyu) 

253
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,920
- That's what you're saying, right?
- Right. So—

254
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,610
You!

255
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,030
I have work for you.

256
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,060
Work? What work?

257
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,330
Noonim, do we just have to do this?

258
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,050
You should be sweating. Sweat!

259
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,850
They're probably coming, right? That Nameless or whatever they are.

260
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,250
They will come. They will.

261
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,460
Do you even know how to do that?

262
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,050
Young Master! The preparations are done.

263
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,470
Nameless. Just try to come out.

264
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,580
Come see me for a bit.

265
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,290
The general said that it has been decided that Prince Jeong Chang will be placed on the throne.

266
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,630
Yes. That was right.

267
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,910
Is it true?
 (Jo Joon) 

268
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:02,990
We've waited so long for this day. How can the general throw away such a good opportunity?

269
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:09,210
Just why? Why do we have to continue this tiring and meaningless fight by enthroning another king?

270
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,990
I know that it is a plan to bring Teacher Po Eun to join our cause.

271
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,030
It is because Teacher Po Eun is that desperately needed for this great cause.

272
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,150
I need to personally meet General Lee Seong Gye and persuade him.

273
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,490
If we keep on dragging time, it will fail.

274
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,830
- But—
- Also,

275
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,410
if Po Eun or Prince Jeong Chang is with Nameless,

276
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,530
if we're being played into their hands...

277
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,050
Last night, an organization called Nameless came to me.

278
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,370
What?

279
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,470
I am asking you.

280
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,730
Are you also connected to Nameless, Po Eun?

281
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,410
Your Highness. That is too much.

282
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:59,110
Those people are interfering with the great cause and are disturbing the country.

283
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,830
The King I will serve must not move according to those people's will.
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

284
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:12,430
Also, the Goryeo that I want to establish is not a country that I want to raise with them.

285
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:18,890
Then, is it okay even if I will not be a scarecrow for those people?

286
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,690
Your Highness.

287
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,570
Can I put my trust in you and

288
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,910
reestablish this country with you?

289
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,290
Of course. Of course, Prince Jeong Chang!

290
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,930
Then, I will do it. I will become the king.

291
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:55,030
Your Highness. I will support you from the bottom of my heart.

292
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,690
Prince Jeong Chang?

293
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,790
Calm down. Why are you doing this?

294
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,030
Do you think I gave you all my hard-earned research just for this?

295
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,250
Where is General Lee Seong Gye? I have to personally meet him and talk to him about this.

296
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,510
Woo Jae, listen to what I say.

297
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,110
This is our chance. Put the general on the throne

298
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,730
You know about the Five Rules, don't you?

299
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,110
Then you must also know what's the most important.

300
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,350
How can you say such a thing?

301
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,470
But Brother...

302
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,150
What is it?

303
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,730
I'm going to convince Po Eun with the FIve Rules.

304
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,990
Woo Jae, just wait. I will tell you soon.

305
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,370
 That Five Rules thing must be the secret weapon to convince Teacher Po Eun. 

306
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,070
 As I thought, he did have something in hand. 

307
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,520
 Whatever the Five Rules are, Prince Jeong Chang won't do! 

308
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,520
 General Lee Seong Gye must be enthroned. 

309
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,690
 This is a heaven-sent opportunity. 

310
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,630
What throne?

311
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,750
I was shocked by the absurd rumor, "Eighteen sons become the king."

312
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,950
Were you really plotting something?

313
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,660
All this time, that great cause or whatever.
 (Lee Bang Woo) 

314
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,490
Was it just a plot to make Father into a traitor?

315
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
It's not that.

316
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,920
If it's not that, how can you say something like putting

317
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,180
our father, who is a general of this country, on the throne?

318
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,040
Just what is going on here?

319
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,610
At Heung Gook Sa today,  the dethronement of the  former king who caused this incident,

320
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,840
and the current king,

321
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,050
and His Highness Prince Jeong Chang's enthronement will be discussed.

322
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,890
Therefore, refrain from making any complaints about it.

323
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:06,140
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

324
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,460
Have you decided on the after measures of the plot against Prime Minister Lee?

325
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,150
Yes. Kim Jeon, who has admitted to the charges, will be executed.

326
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,120
And, including Lords Jo Sang Won and Lee Do Soo, who were investigated by the Investigation Bureau,

327
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,750
the 27 people who are tied to this incident will be sent into exile.

328
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,730
Also, the former king who led this assassination will be moved to Gangreung,

329
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,780
and the current king will be dethroned and sent to Ganghwa.

330
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,120
Then now the issue is to enthrone a king who will

331
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,470
gather the torn public sentiment and enforce the reformation.

332
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,650
So I—

333
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,510
I wish for Prince Jeong Chang to be enthroned.

334
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,090
I agree with the general.

335
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:03,680
I also think that Prince Jeong Chang is the appropriate person.

336
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,640
I also agree.

337
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,460
Then, we've decided on Prince Jeong Chang, right?

338
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,830
Welcome. Are you looking for a sword?

339
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,110
This is the place that provides assassins.

340
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,390
What do you mean?

341
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,870
The assassin that went to Mt. Goon Myo. Whose inquiry was it?

342
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,570
I don't know about that. It is my hyung-nim who knows.

343
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,170
You probably have a ledger.

344
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,050
Still.

345
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,490
Do I have to take it after I kill you?

346
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,620
No, please just wait. Aigoo.

347
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,810
It's here. Here. Look at this.

348
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,610
Yes.

349
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,930
Hwa Sa Dan came.

350
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,610
How was I? Was I good?

351
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,110
You were awkward. You should've shed a tear as well.

352
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,600
I don't know the feeling.

353
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,790
You should've been more like-- Aigoo!

354
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,660
You guys sent assassins to Goon Myo Mountain last night, right?

355
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,200
 Bi Guk Temple? Even them?
(Gap Boon) 

356
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,170
What do you mean?

357
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:51,500
Ledger. You probably have a ledger. Give it to me.

358
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,610
Hwa Sa Dan took it.

359
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,960
Aigoo. Aigoo.

360
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,070
Hwa Sa Dan took the ledger. Bi Guk Temple also came looking for the ledger.

361
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,690
Both of them made their move?

362
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,560
Since both of them received orders and moved,

363
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,960
there's no way of confirming whether they did it on their own or because of an order from Nameless.

364
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,990
Then, should we follow both of them?

365
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,090
Nothing will come from following Nameless. We should make them come.

366
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,020
How?

367
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,330
It would be nice if this method works...

368
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,490
Hwa Sa Dan has taken the ledger. We were one step too late.

369
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,130
It seems that Hwa Sa Dan got orders from Prince Jeong Chang.

370
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:51,980
We will attack Hwa Sa Dan, take the ledger, and find out who ordered the assassins.

371
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,720
You don't have to.

372
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Ji Cheon Tae is here.

373
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,550
 Ji Cheon Tae? 

374
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,040
You... Why are you here?

375
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,350
What about you? How?

376
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,370
Greet each other.

377
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:33,310
This is Ji Cheon Tae Cho Young. This is Pung Ji Gwan Jeok Ryong. You know each other, right?

378
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,840
 To think we were on the same side as Hwa Sa Dan... 

379
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,810
 Bi Guk Temple is part of our organization?
(Cho Yeong: Hwa Sa Dan Owner) 

380
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:47,830
That's right. Who sent the assassins to Prince Jeong Chang?

381
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,360
It was Lee Bang Won.

382
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,610
Lee Bang Won?

383
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,900
General Lee Seong Gye's 5th son.

384
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,140
 Please come, Nameless. 

385
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,190
 How could your "kill the ash tree flower" plan fail? I still have Maengdo Chilyak in my hands. 

386
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,040
 Lee Bang Won 

387
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,980
 How did he know, "Kill the ash tree flower"? 

388
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,850
Why are you like that?

389
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,100
What is it?

390
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:57,130
There's a spy in our organization?

391
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,820
Maengdo Chilyak.

392
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,270
Lee Bang Won.

393
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,410
Are you just going to chase after Nameless?

394
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,700
What is it, Wife?

395
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,650
Prince Jeong Chang is rising to the throne.

396
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,800
So what?

397
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,700
I'm uneasy because I think we have missed a great opportunity.

398
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,640
Jo Min Soo gave us a chance and this time, it was the previous king who gave it to us.

399
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,020
But why?

400
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,910
It was Teacher Sam Bong and Father's will.

401
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:46,090
Father? Teacher Sam Bong? You can't always just say yes to the elders' decisions.
 (Min Da Kyeong: Future Queen Wongyeong) 

402
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:51,580
Shouldn't you prepare just in case their decisions aren't right?

403
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,240
 King Gong Yang: Goryeo's 34th king 

404
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,230
We achieved a great thing together.

405
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,210
Yes.

406
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,530
That's why I think I should have another talk with you.

407
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,600
We should.

408
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,920
Are you going to persuade me?

409
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,940
Yes. I have to.

410
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,380
Would you like to have a drink at Jangyeonggak on the 15th?

411
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,870
Yes. That's good.

412
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,600
I will see you on that day.

413
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,210
Okay.

414
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,480
 I will surely make you give up, Sam Bong. 

415
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,820
Just remain as a hero who saved Goryeo through reformation. You mustn't be a traitor.

416
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,960
How can things be so wrong?

417
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,120
Instead of being wrong, I see it as things getting stronger.

418
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,570
Yes, I understand.

419
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,400
I will trust you.

420
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,660
It seems that Teacher Woo Jae is still not okay.

421
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,900
That's Woo Jae's temper. It will take a while.

422
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,730
What? What about my temper?

423
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,970
I have such a sweet temper so

424
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,840
yes, I'm okay now too.

425
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,300
Seriously.

426
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:19,270
I arranged a place at Do Hwa Jeon so let's have a drink after such a long time.

427
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,270
That's what I'm saying.

428
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,530
I didn't know I would come to eat here again.

429
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,470
Bang Gwa, check if someone's hiding in that room.

430
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,480
What if someone with an axe barges in again saying he will cut the meat for us?

431
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,390
Come, everyone. Have a seat.

432
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,220
Are you telling us to eat at the same table?

433
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,030
We will eat separately.

434
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,260
No.

435
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,990
You contributed a lot for us to come all this way. Sit down.

436
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:24,700
We made it here after difficulties but we have to take a more difficult path from here on.

437
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,200
Once these turbulent times are over, for the coming peaceful time,

438
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,530
let's all raise our cups!

439
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,860
Here, here.

440
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,830
When the peaceful time comes, what do you all want to do?

441
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,790
A dream. You're talking about a dream, right?

442
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:59,450
Okay. Since you don't know, I will tell you about my long-time dream.

443
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,870
I...

444
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:11,600
Once the peaceful time comes, I will write a poem.
 (Lee Ji Ran) 

445
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,910
A warm poem.

446
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,550
Don't laugh. I'm being serious.

447
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,860
Poem. Poem!

448
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,050
What about you? Let's hear about your dream.

449
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,330
My dream?

450
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,350
My dream is actually very clear.

451
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,320
I want my name to be written in history!

452
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,450
His name...

453
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,220
What name do you want in there?

454
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:04,170
What do you mean. Just Jo Young Gyu. These three words in the history.

455
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,150
What do you want yourself to be named in history?

456
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,460
More than putting my name in history, I want to leave a record.

457
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,450
A record?

458
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:30,710
When peaceful time comes, I want to write books until I die.

459
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:36,340
All the things that I've learned, memorized and thought about, throughout my life.

460
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,420
It's been my long-time dream to record them in writing for future generations.

461
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,870
Of course.

462
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:48,550
A person like Sam Bong must go only after recording everything that's in your head.

463
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:54,570
If you just leave, it will be a crime to the future generations.

464
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,530
That's right. That's right.

465
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,720
Here, everyone have a drink!

466
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:09,510
Thinking that they would ask me, I was sweating so hard.

467
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:14,360
You were mumbling to yourself. You were getting ready to answer if they asked, right?

468
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,570
No.

469
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,750
What is your dream, Warrior-nim?

470
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,190
My real dream is...
 (Moo Hyul) 

471
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,510
I only told Young Master about it.

472
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:37,120
 When the time comes that you make the people of the world smile, I will also feel satisfaction. 

473
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,490
What about you, Bang Ji?

474
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,060
Me...

475
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,990
Making Boon Yi's dream come true.

476
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,460
And finding mother.

477
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,950
Then what about you?

478
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,410
Me?

479
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,480
Don't make fun of me.

480
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,780
This is embarrassing.

481
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,310
Talking about your dream is usually a bit embarrassing.

482
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,370
I

483
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,830
want to make the people in the world smile.

484
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,330
Protecting your dreams.

485
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,500
How?

486
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,990
Politics... Politics that protect your dreams and make people smile.

487
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,660
Yeah.

488
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,990
Do the kind of politics that make people feel happiness in their daily lives.

489
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,970
That will do.

490
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,740
- I think you'll do well.
- Are you being honest?

491
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,950
To some extent.

492
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,870
Lee Bang Won...

493
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:04,220
He received the Hae Dong Gap Jok's alliance contract.

494
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,820
He intercepted Hong In Bang's marriage plan,

495
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,060
and became Min Jae's son-in-law.

496
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,780
What's more

497
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,490
is that, at the same time as we appeared in front of Wang Yo,

498
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,090
- he sent assassins.
 - Should we try to contact him?

499
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,850
Maengdo Chilyak.

500
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,470
Maengdo Chilyak.

501
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,700
What could this be?

502
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,410
Will there ever be a time of peaceful reign?

503
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,920
- Probably. 
 - What?

504
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,090
Humans always

505
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,610
find the thing that's lacking in whatever situation.

506
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,220
So that's why politics is forever needed.

507
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,700
 You are Lee Bang Won? 

508
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,960
How do you know about "kill the ash tree flower"?

509
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,440
- How do you know?
-  You've appeared 

510
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,980
 Nameless! 
Are you the Nameless?

511
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,180
Don't be so nervous.

512
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,900
I just came to see if we could have a talk.

513
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,150
Hey you, the warrior in the back. Relax a bit

514
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,990
for the safety of your young master.

515
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,160
How do you think I know about "kill the ash tree flower"?

516
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,950
It's obvious, isn't it?

517
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,370
The guy who got captured by the Investigation Bureau

518
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,120
probably opened his mouth.

519
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,090
Then why have you come?

520
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,990
Were you curious about Maengdo Chilyak?

521
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,460
Whatever the Maengo Chilyak is, it has no effect on the current situation.

522
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,970
So from now on,

523
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,280
stop planning such poor and lame schemes.

524
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,100
This isn't something you can mess with.

525
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,540
Remember that.

526
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,840
The one who never existed will always be there.

527
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,070
The one with no name will never disappear.

528
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,040
Do you think that guy also said this?

529
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,870
For what?

530
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,880
Then...

531
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,440
There is a traitor on our side.

532
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,830
Is that what you are saying? Even so,

533
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,120
why are you telling me that?

534
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,210
To be suspicious of each  other?

535
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,560
I'm guessing your organization trusts each other very well.

536
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,700
Shouldn't you be questioning each other the closer you are with each other?

537
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,840
For example,

538
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,060
Ji Cheon Tae.

539
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,730
How much do you trust him?

540
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,100
Me..?

541
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,620
Are you suspecting me?

542
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,010
Jeong Mong Joo and Jeong Do Jeon have even worked together to enthone a new king.

543
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,640
Then, as someone who is watching over Jeong Do Jeon,

544
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,330
what have you been doing so far?

545
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,390
If Jeong Mong Joo

546
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:34,090
doesn't move as we wish, then we have to find another sword.

547
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,590
Like the time we attacked King Gong Min,

548
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,280
we need the usefulness of someone like Hong Ryun.

549
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,180
But can we give such a task to you?

550
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,430
I'm in doubt.

551
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,560
Ji Cheon Tae!

552
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,670
Information is leaking from your side.

553
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,170
How does that guy know Ji Cheon Tae?

554
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,950
There is an agent we placed inside Jeong Do Jeon's group.

555
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,860
I will keep an eye on her first.

556
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,280
You must find out!

557
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,650
Also,

558
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,110
Maengdo Chilyak.

559
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,180
Find out what this is.

560
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,250
Have you found out?

561
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,910
It's clear that they have joined together to enthrone Jeong Chang Goon,

562
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,030
but what future plans they have

563
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,450
aren't so clear.

564
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,070
I guess it must be difficult since your identity has been known.

565
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:39,120
Do not get involved in this mission anymore.

566
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,650
- Owner!
- I will give you a different target.

567
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,680
But before you do so,

568
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,040
find out Po Eun and Sam Bong's plan.

569
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,640
If you find out anything, report immediately.

570
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,330
Report to me tomorrow at the hour of Jinshi (7-9 am).

571
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,050
How is that?

572
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,050
Yes. I will do so.

573
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:12,080
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

574
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,740
Tomorrow at the hour of Jinshi (7-9 am)?

575
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,140
I will have to report tomorrow.

576
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,000
When you report to Cho Young tomorrow,

577
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,810
as if we are planning something,

578
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,160
with the name, Maeng Do...

579
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,300
But you weren't able to hear what's next.

580
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,810
Maeng Do... What? What is that?

581
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,210
Is it the name of Bon Won's new plan?

582
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,070
If Cho Young

583
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,930
asks if that was Maengdo Chilyak

584
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:53,550
then Cho Young is Nameless.

585
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,150
But Hwa Sa Dan is an information organization.

586
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,970
She could have found out through other means.

587
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,840
That couldn't happen.

588
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,380
That name is just something that I made up.

589
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,170
Okay. I'll try that.

590
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,350
 Okay, we're going! There! 

591
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,250
 Aigoo. One more time! 

592
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,430
Throwing it one more time!

593
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,410
A 'geh'? How could you get a 'geh'?

594
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,750
 Take a look at this one. 

595
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:46,620
What is there to look at? They are all so expensive.

596
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,340
Yeon Hee will soon arrive.

597
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,210
And she will make a final confirmation of Cho Young.

598
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,330
If it's confirmed, then we immediately go in

599
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,830
and arrest Cho Young, right?

600
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,380
It sounds like a pretty good plan.

601
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,070
Yes. Bang Won came up with that plan.

602
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,330
I will meet Po Eun today at the hour of Oh (11am - 1pm) in Jangyeonggak

603
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,860
and persuade him.

604
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,020
Are you going to tell him about the Five Rules?

605
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,460
I will definitely convince him with it.

606
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,570
Yes. Please do so.

607
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,380
 At the hour of Oh in Jangyeonggak. 

608
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,380
Owner, how...

609
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,990
I couldn't sit still.

610
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,250
Have you found out what I asked you to?

611
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,480
Sam Bong and Po Eun are meeting secretly today.

612
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,720
Where are they meeting?

613
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,000
I haven't been able find out the location,

614
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,680
but if you give me some time, I will find out.

615
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,000
 Yeon Hee! It was you...? 

616
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,030
- Yeon Hee.
- Yes, Owner.

617
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,330
Sam Bong

618
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,640
will meet Po Eun at Jangyeonggak

619
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,050
at the hour of Oh.

620
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,520
Didn't he tell you that a while ago?

621
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,280
My ever so deep trust in you has ruined the plan.

622
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:10,790
I will give you a last chance. What is Maengdo Chilyak?

623
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,060
Maengdo Chilyak.

624
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,930
Are you a Nameless?

625
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:29,110
So you are Ji Cheon Tae.

626
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:36,370
Too much time has passed. Why is Yeon Hee not coming?

627
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:40,410
She definitely said that she agreed to report to Cho Young here today.

628
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,060
What if Cho Young found out?

629
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:05,110
Come here!

630
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,950
Lock Yeon Hee away.

631
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,200
Yes, Owner.

632
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,380
It's Jangyeonggak. It will happen at the hour of Oh so hurry and make preparations.

633
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,530
I will go there soon.

634
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,910
Yes, I understand.

635
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,200
What happened?

636
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,950
Cho Young isn't here. A servant named Bi Yul isn't even here either.

637
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,620
There's no reason for Yeon Hee to be this late.

638
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,820
Does this mean that Cho Young acted first?

639
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,630
Lady Yeon Hee said she was going to meet Teacher Sam Bong at the cave.

640
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,960
If Cho Young is a nameless, she probably knows about the cave as well.

641
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,580
Young Gyu, keep watch at this place.

642
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,300
Yes.

643
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,700
- Owner is a Nameless.
- What does that mean?

644
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,920
Don't you see? It's been revealed that she is a Nameless.

645
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,800
Nameless has killed three government officials and tried to assassinate General Lee Seong Gye twice.

646
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,860
All of that will be known and our Hwa Sa Dan

647
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,500
will be exterminated.

648
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,850
Please release me. Let's all live.

649
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,740
Are you going to kill the other girls too?

650
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,980
You people of Hwa Sa Dan were Nameless' puppets.

651
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:28,480
Throw your swords! Aren't we all supposed to live?

652
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,930
Are you thinking of dying together?

653
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:41,980
You talk so much for a traitor. Aren't you the one who tricked the Owner?

654
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,520
She was the one who tricked us.

655
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,530
Hwa Sa Dan uses politics, but does not chase after politics.

656
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,020
We were nothing but a subordinate organization.

657
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,270
Shut up, wench!

658
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,700
We are not Nameless.

659
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,610
We don't have any connection with Nameless.

660
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,470
It's just something connected to the Owner.

661
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,920
What about Cho Young?

662
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,720
She probably went to Jangyeonggak.

663
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,650
Elder Bon Won and Teacher Po Eun were supposed to meet there today.

664
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,600
Please hurry and go there.

665
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,540
Jangyeonggak. Let's go.

666
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,840
Have you had any thoughts about the king?

667
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,120
Yes.

668
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:02,070
I believe that the king of the new country should not be an omnipotent, above the law.

669
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,940
So?

670
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,920
 First of all, the king of the new country will have to endlessly study. 

671
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,590
I will create a system where a contest is held for the king and his Neo-Confucian subjects to debate and argue.

672
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,080
O-Owner.

673
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,430
I'm listening right now.

674
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,580
So we're seeing each other again this way.

675
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,330
Nameless' Ji Cheon Tae.

676
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,200
Are you going to commit suicide?

677
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,720
That's just for the lowly servants. Should I head over to the Investigation Bureau then?

678
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,940
Take her there.

679
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:25,130
So you are saying the king has to be an excellent Confucian scholar in a Neo-Confucian country. What's next?

680
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,210
The king cannot privately discuss politics with any of his subjects.

681
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:34,360
The king must only be for the public. Private meetings only grow personal motives,

682
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,550
and those motives will bear fruit as wrong decisions.

683
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,720
 Will not be allowed to have private talks? 

684
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,200
Also the king of the new country cannot have any personal wealth and assets.

685
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,180
All the king's assets must be managed by his subjects.

686
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:58,960
 Also, besides the power to choose the prime minister, he must not be able to interfere with appointing officials. 

687
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:05,960
Then, just what is the king to this country?

688
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,050
 The king is just this country's flower. 

689
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:16,260
The roots have to be this land's scholars, Confucian scholars, and officials.

690
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:22,740
Not those who were passed down the power due to family's high status, but are composed of only those Sadaebu that have had their hard-earned skills recognized.

691
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,110
A rank hierarchy without any hereditary passing down of power...

692
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,500
You are saying that the hereditary passing down of power gives birth to discontinuation of scholars.

693
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,110
Yes. And the last one.

694
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,450
Please speak.

695
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:40,030
The royal family will not be allowed to politically participate under any circumstances.

696
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:46,270
Once the country is founded, all the rights and power will be taken from the king's kindred and will make them unable to do anything.

697
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,410
By doing so, we'll stop them from doing things by their own authority.

698
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:11,040
 Making the world's people laugh. Making your dreams come true. 

699
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,230
 Oh. How? 

700
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,730
 Through politics. 

701
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,440
 Politics that will protect dreams and make the world's people smile. 

702
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,430
 Right. Make sure to do politics that will give people happiness in their lives. 

703
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:31,940
 You probably couldn't stand the feeling of being helpless. 

704
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:42,400

706
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,580
 Did you have a good talk with Teacher Po Eun? 

707
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,660
 I showed him my sincerity. 

708
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,520
 The kind of politics that will make people smile and make them happy is just a dream.  

709
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,140
 What? Her children are alive? 

710
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,450
 Do you think that Mother is deeply connected with Nameless? 

711
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,040
 Look for siblings around Lee Bang Won.  

712
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,600
 Lee Bang Won. How about making him our new sword? 

713
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,160
 Young Master Bang Won seems a bit strange. 

714
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,390
 I don't have a place? No, this whole place will become mine.  

715
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,900
 It's nice to see you with a topknot. 

716
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,340
 Because I'm not a child anymore.
