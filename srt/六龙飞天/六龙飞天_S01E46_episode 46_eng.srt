00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,830
 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,930
 Confirmation? 

3
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,530
To see if I can do it,
 Episode 46 

4
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,490
I went to see them and confirm it.

5
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,700
Moo Hyul.

6
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,480
Yes, Your Highness.

7
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,490
Bang Seok...

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,800
Jeong Do Jeon...

9
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,410
I'll have to kill them.

10
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,590
 Whatever decision he comes up with, 

11
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,630
 you have to follow it no matter what. 

12
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,690
But how?

13
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,890
Your private army got taken

14
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,790
and you will always be monitored.

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,310
Young Gyu Hyungnim has risked his life to protect the armory, but

16
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,370
even gathering the troops will be hard.

17
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,440
Even gathering right away will not be easy.

18
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,850
If we gather, it will be reported fast.

19
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,620
Young Gyu Hyung

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,550
has arranged a place for us.

21
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,200
Young Gyu Hyung's

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,290
funeral.

23
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,170
People who have been separated into each district,

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,650
Young Gyu Hyung's colleagues,

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,970
comrades, and our people,

26
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,360
send a message to everyone.

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,270
In the place arranged by Jo Young Gyu,

28
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,640
tell everyone to gather.

29
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,920
Blood stains.

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,630
You see it, right?

31
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,530
Can you go and get a hammer?

32
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:03,050
 Lee Shin Jeok 

33
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,410
You're here?

34
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,120
 It was Guksan swordsmanship. 

35
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,390
 My hesitation... 

36
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,680
 My recklessness... 

37
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,740
What should we do?

38
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,200
Where is His Highness the Prince?

39
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,250
Over there.

40
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,500
Of the people who came to offer their condolences, the people you specified

41
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,450
have been escorted by me.

42
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,190
Right.

43
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,400
But Lord Lee Shin Jeok also came.

44
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,330
What should I do?

45
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,210
Leave him out for now.

46
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,240
You also came, Brothers-in-law?

47
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,200
Yes, Hyung-nim.
 (Min Mu Jil and Min Moo Gu) 

48
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,030
I'm sorry, Husband.

49
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,150
Minister Jo

50
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,760
ended up like this because of the thing I requested.

51
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,350
If you put it that way, everyone's already wrong from the moment they were born.

52
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,580
Don't say that.

53
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,990
- Let's go in.
- Yes.

54
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,200
To think that Young Gyu Hyung died like this...
 (Lee Cheon Woo) 

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,770
I can't believe it.

56
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,460
Was it from Lord Sam Bong's side?

57
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,500
Nothing's confirmed yet.
 (Lee Bang Won: Prince Jeong An, Lee Seong Gye's 5th son) 

58
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,830
While protecting our armory,

59
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,730
he just ended up like this.

60
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,770
It's obvious. Who could have done it?

61
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,070
Casting away all of us who risked our lives in the battlefield for His Highness,

62
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,300
Sam Bong, that bastard, is benefiting from all of it.

63
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,570
Bang Won, are you just going to stay like this? Let's overthrow this now.
 (Lee Bang Gan: Prince Hwoe An, Lee Seong Gye's 4th son) 

64
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,170
What can we do at this moment?

65
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,920
It's all a gamble now anyway.

66
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,500
Young Gyu already told us to secretly take out private soldiers no matter what.
 (Park Po) 

67
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,180
Aren't we supposed to do something?

68
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,960
All of you

69
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,870
are people who have close relations with Young Gyu Hyung,

70
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,520
so I selectively gathered you here.

71
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,310
From here on,

72
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,200
until the 49th day of Young Gyu Hyungnim's death, we will hold a funeral rite seven times at Hongji temple.

73
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,130
All of you must attend.

74
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,110
Let's closely discuss the situation.

75
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,000
The opportunity that Young Gyu Hyungnim arranged

76
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,210
must not be in vain.

77
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,270
What about Lord Ha Ryun?

78
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,220
He's been contacted so he's probably on his way.

79
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,980
Lord Sam Bong came.

80
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,630
 The one woman must be Wife Min 

81
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,940
 and there are ten men. 

82
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,100
 So all those who are against the private army dissolution  have gathered. 

83
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,190
 Will I end up fighting Bang Ji? 

84
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,670
 Will I lose? 

85
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,730
What happened?

86
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,790
I think it's Cheok Sa Gwang.

87
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,820
What?

88
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,070
 My goodness. They say that the Wang Family is hiding in Banchon 

89
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,250
 as the Oak Family. 

90
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,110
 They got caught as they were going out of Banchon 

91
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,560
 and they were arrested. 

92
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,850
 They probably died. 

93
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,470
 That's too bad. The child didn't even look like he was ten-years old yet. 

94
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,720
Your Highness.

95
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,250
He was more like a brother to you than your real brothers, right?

96
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,600
He was.

97
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,290
He also treated people like us well.
 (Boon Yi: Banchon's Leader) 

98
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,340
How could it happen in Banchon...

99
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,860
 You know that he died in Banchon? 

100
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,620
I have seen blood stains

101
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,080
and the inside of the armory.

102
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,940
 In any kind of situation, 

103
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,170
 you must not be swept away by me or Sam Bong. 

104
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,840
 Even if I die, 

105
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,020
 still, 

106
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,290
 you'll probably be smiling somewhere else. 

107
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,870
 So I will be able to think that way. 

108
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,850
 I'm really sorry. 

109
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,900
 I wanted to at least keep you out of it. 

110
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,460
Do you have anything to say because of it?

111
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,860
It's mine. That storage is mine.

112
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:22,290
It was made when Banchon was established, and it can't be taken out now. If there is ever bloodshed,

113
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,750
it will be probably be taken out then.

114
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,400
Expose it if you want.

115
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,250
Even if you do, Banchon won't be able to avoid the criminal charge.

116
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,730
Why do you say it like that?

117
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,990
It's so that you will make a good decision when that day comes,

118
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:48,010
so that you will do your best for yourself and for your people.

119
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,230
When is that?

120
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,560
I don't know

121
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,070
whether that day will come or not.

122
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:07,440
But even if it's for your sake, I still don't think I will be able to keep myself from using it.

123
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,520
 Zhu Yuan Zhang 

124
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,190
Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang)...

125
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,750
A message came from Ming.

126
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,820
You and Lord Jo Young Gyu

127
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,560
were close like brothers, even before.

128
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,860
Nobody would feel worse than you.

129
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,680
Yes. That's right.

130
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,950
How could this happen?

131
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,630
I also don't know

132
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,940
how this happened.

133
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,470
Elder!

134
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,450
Is it that woman? Lord Sam Bong's woman?

135
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,460
It's like that.

136
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,440
Your Highness!

137
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,770
What?

138
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:42,200
Yes. It seems that Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) has died.

139
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,970
There hasn't been an official declaration from the Mings, but according to our intelligence in the royal court,

140
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,250
it seems to be the truth.

141
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,570
Ju Won Jang...

142
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,320
Ju Won Jang... This fast?

143
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,760
Yes. That's right.

144
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,250
 Your Highness, Lord Ha Ryun has arrived. 

145
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:15,280
I don't think Monk Jeok Ryong was ever close enough to Lord Jo Young Gyu to give his condolences.

146
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,210
That thing has happened.

147
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,090
That thing?

148
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,780
Was it Ju Won Jang?

149
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,020
Bang Ji, immediately go to Jo Joon, Shim Hyo Saeng, and Nam Eun's houses and tell them to see me in the morning.

150
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,250
Yes. I understand.

151
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,750
Things are becoming critical now.

152
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,650
Sam Bong will now dispatch the troops.

153
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,730
Let's attack Sam Bong.

154
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:57,220
Let's first get rid of Sam Bong, Nam Eun, and Shim Hyo Saeng, then take over the investigation bureau,

155
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,800
surround the royal palace

156
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,160
ask for the title of crown prince.

157
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,610
But, Your Highness.

158
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,530
It's not possible to take over the investigation bureau and the palace with the soldiers we hid away.

159
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,640
Yes. Sook Bun and I could gather the provincial troops,

160
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,250
but how would we be able to enter the capital?

161
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,870
We can't move that many soldiers in broad daylight without people knowing.

162
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,580
If we move them in the darkness of the night, the gates will be closed.

163
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,660
Then we would have to go with a siege.

164
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,690
If we do, then the fire signal will go up right away.

165
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,740
Yes. That's right.

166
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,720
So think of a plan.

167
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,630
I will think about it.

168
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,100
What? Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) has died?

169
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,310
Yes, Your Highness. This our chance. Please give your command.

170
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,160
You must not, Your Highness. There are so many variables to the Liaodong expedition.

171
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,880
If we have to consider all the variables in everything, what can we do in this world?

172
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,110
Your Highness, there are always variables in the battlefield,

173
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,460
but we have continuously had the battle formation training.

174
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,820
We have dissolved the private armies

175
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,760
and three years worth of provisions have been prepared.

176
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,080
With this war, we will be able to break the chain of submission to the strong,

177
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,930
and the land of Three Kingdoms will be even more prosperous. And that prosperity

178
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,490
will go back to the people, Your Highness.

179
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,970
Tell all the princes to come to the palace.

180
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,320
Your Highness, Prince Jeong An is entering.

181
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,780
I came here because of your summons.

182
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,580
Bang Gwa.

183
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,200
Yes, Father.

184
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,730
You have made a lot of contributions while accompanying me in a lot of battlefield.

185
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,260
Thank you.

186
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:24,700
Bang Gan, while I was not present, you did well in guiding the North.

187
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,150
I am also grateful for that.

188
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,960
It's the obvious thing to do.

189
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:37,710
And Bang Won, you are educated and intelligent.

190
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,440
You have also resolved a difficult diplomacy problem in Ming.

191
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:55,230
Bang Beon, you have to learn from your older brothers' good traits. Do you understand?

192
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,230
Yes. I understand, Father.

193
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,500
So, once again,

194
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,120
it would be nice if you can help me one more time.

195
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:18,670
All of you, with me,

196
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,900
let's go to Liaodong.

197
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,050
Left Minister. His Majesty has already made his decision. Please help us.

198
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,640
I just cannot understand or approve of it.

199
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,910
He took all of our private armies and now he's telling us to go to war.

200
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,600
While we are at Liaodong,

201
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,990
His Highness is going to earn more time for the crown prince to have a foothold in Hanyang.

202
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,340
That's not all. If we die, Sam Bong will be dancing (from happiness).

203
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,610
Sam Bong, this bastard, has laid out a fine plan.

204
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,470
 Crown Prince is here! 

205
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,570
Seeing Father's trust in all of you, I feel very envious.

206
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,760
That's very generous of you to say, Your Highness.

207
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,760
I wish you all good fortune in the war.

208
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:59,980
 How could things proceed so quickly? I have to think of a way to break through. 

209
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,450
It's a letter from Lord Ha Ryun.

210
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,760
 There's only one way. 

211
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,630
 You know that Her Highness' royal tomb is in the capital, right? 

212
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,810
 The military governors near Gyeonggi are taking turns to construct boundaries for a grave. 

213
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,720
 Of course, Ansan Governor Lee Suk Beon is also included. 

214
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,150
 When Lee Suk Beon's turn comes, 

215
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,800
 that day, lawfully 500 soldiers 

216
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,440
 can go into the capital. 

217
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,780
Moo Hyul, immediately go to Ansan Governor Lee Suk Beon.

218
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,370
Find out when he's going to Her Highness' royal tomb.

219
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,880
Yes.

220
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,990
 Between the date of march to Liaodong and the date of Lee Sook Beon's turn, 

221
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,720
 Which one would be faster? 

222
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,430
We have the date for the military expedition. It's the lucky day sent by the meteorological office.

223
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,690
Then, deliver this to His Highness.

224
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,580
Yes, my Lord.

225
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,370
Hyungnim, all the members of Milbon have been mobilized
 (Jeong Do Kwang: Jeong Do Jeon's younger brother) 

226
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,210
and are trying to generate public opinion in agreement with this war.

227
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,620
- What?
- Why are you like that?

228
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,740
What are you saying?

229
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,020
- Do you think I created Milbon to do that?
- Why...

230
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,080
Milbon's most important duty is

231
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,310
to stop the Sadaebu's own corruption.

232
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,210
The Sadaebu can become corrupt with power at any time.

233
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,910
No matter how good a bureaucratic system we create,

234
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,840
if the Sadaebu become corrupt, everything will be for nothing.

235
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,510
So it's set up for them to  be on guard for each others' desires and keep watch over each other.

236
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,970
- But...
- Of course, if the king,

237
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,640
or some powerful group, forgets the ideals of Minbon (the people are the root)

238
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,130
and tries to ruin the system we made for Joseon,

239
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,880
we have to boldly rise up and prevent it.

240
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,650
If such a tragedy happens,

241
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,950
and all the systems are destroyed,

242
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,110
it has to take cover and hide for it to survive.

243
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,130
I made it a hidden association.

244
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,170
Even when a system is held in place like now,

245
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,420
how could you still try to use such crafty maneuvers.

246
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,100
Yes. I will keep that in mind.

247
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,960
Please tell Elder Sam Bong.

248
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,320
- We must not.
- Why?

249
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,440
What will happen to Grandma Myo Sang, as the storage owner?

250
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,450
She will be arrested as Prince Jeong An's person and will receive harsh interrogation.

251
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,980
It will be the same for Moo Hyul.

252
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,280
It will the same for the two of us who came from Prince Jeong An's residence.

253
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,890
Also, this many weapons are in Banchon.

254
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,980
Would the investigation bureau think this could have been done without our cooperation?

255
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,410
Then, what do we do now?

256
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,030
 If that day comes, 

257
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,390
 make a good decision. For yourself and for your people, 

258
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,530
 do your best for all of you to survive. 

259
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,690
How can you say you are going to enter the battle yourself?

260
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,170
It can't ever happen.

261
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,590
Stop saying that I can't

262
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,370
- and just help me recover from the disease.
- Hyungnim!

263
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,560
You must think of your health at a time like this.

264
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,490
Can you even properly ride a horse like this? Hyungnim,

265
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,940
- you're also aging.
- Nonsense.

266
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,030
I will still ride a horse for 20 more years!

267
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,030
 Left Minister Jo Joon is entering. 

268
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,590
Let him in!

269
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,980
You called for me, Your Highness.

270
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,130
I

271
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,250
don't think that you're wrong

272
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,430
just for having different thoughts than Sam Bong.

273
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,730
I

274
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,480
am someone who became a king after disobeying a royal command to conquer Liaodong.

275
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,220
But, Your Highness, that kind of personal feeling...

276
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,120
Of course, it's not because of that.

277
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,220
Left Minister, take charge of the crown prince.

278
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,660
Please guide the crown prince to become

279
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,390
an amazing king.

280
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,170
Then what about the other princes?

281
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,440
The other princes

282
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,940
will go to Liaodong with me. Right about now,

283
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,780
Lord Nam Eun must be secretly

284
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,010
informing them about the expedition.

285
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,170
It's the royal command.

286
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,020
The date of the military expedition is highly confidential

287
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,320
so please memorize it and destroy it.

288
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,640
Yes. I know.

289
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:02,180


290
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:09,090
 South Hanyang troops, assemble in front of Sukjeon Gate, August 20 ohshi (11am-1pm) 

291
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,030
So the expedition is on the 20th.

292
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,510
Yes. If Lee Suk Beon's turn to come to the capital is

293
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,510
a day before the 20th...

294
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,610
Moo Hyul went so there will be news soon.

295
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,110
I have to go to Young Gyu Hyung's funeral rite. Please prepare.

296
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,190
Your Highness!

297
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,990
When is it?

298
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,660
It's on August 26.

299
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,390
26th...

300
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,970
- It's on the 26th.
- Husband.

301
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,620
 The day of the expedition is the 20th. The day Lee Suk Beon comes back 

302
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,340
 is on the 26th. We screwed up. 

303
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,220
 Is there really no way? 

304
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,740
Lee Suk Beon's

305
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,180
turn will be on the 26th.

306
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,480
Without Lord Lee Suk Beon,
 (Jo Mal Saeng) 

307
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,270
- it will be hard to succeed.
- Then, what should we do?

308
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:37,080
We have to march on the day of the expedition no matter what.

309
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,430
Seven days until the expedition.

310
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,900
Before that, we have to make a choice.

311
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,340
Look for another opportunity in the future

312
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,420
or risk our lives on a small chance.

313
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,090
 Young Gyu Hyung, tell me. 

314
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,900
 You were the one who created this opportunity. 

315
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,110
- What happened?
- Tonight,

316
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,300
we will attack Sam Bong.

317
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,350
- Then...
- We must remove

318
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,890
the weapons in Banchon without getting caught.

319
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,170
 Your Highness, this is Jeok Ryong. 

320
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,460
I will attack Sam Bong today.

321
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,610
I have decided.

322
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,830
The heavens are on your side, Your Highness.

323
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,310
Your Highness.

324
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,240
Why didn't you say anything?

325
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,550
Don't concern yourself.

326
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,760
It's something that has always happened

327
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,320
and it will get better soon.

328
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,540
It has always been like that.

329
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,100
Then, Your Highness, the date of the expedition...

330
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,590
It's done. The date of the expedition

331
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,330
has been postponed for seven days.

332
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,280
It will be on August 27th.

333
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,630
Lee Suk Beon's Ansan troops

334
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,140
will enter the capital on the 26th.

335
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,880
I don't believe in heaven's will but

336
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,260
it's really mysterious.

337
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,560
There will be a revolt on that day.

338
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,270
If it fails, what should we do, Mugeuk?

339
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,180
We'd have to get rid of Prince Jeong An.

340
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,090
If the revolt fails, get ready with the next preparations.

341
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,610
Yes, Mugeuk. What should I prepare?

342
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,160
Set all of the grain storages

343
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,230
in Hanyang on fire.

344
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,350
The expedition is on the 27th.

345
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,670
The day Lee Suk Beon enters the capital

346
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,740
is the 26th.

347
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,860
We only have one day.

348
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,450
First, the result of the rebellion

349
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,840
depends on whether we can kill

350
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,100
Jeong Do Jeon, Nam Eun, and Shim Hyo Saeng in the early stage.

351
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,400
We have to kill them to easily get a hold of the Three National Armies.

352
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:55,300
And only by doing that we'll be able to make Father, Lord Jo Joon and Ji Ran give up.

353
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,670
As for Bi Guk Temple,

354
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,610
clearly figure out Jeong Do Jeon's location.

355
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,610
Hwasadan and the spy's movements need to be blocked.

356
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,410
Don't worry, Your Highness.

357
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:19,810
Second is Lee Bang Ji.

358
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,030
We have to lure Lee Bang Ji out to raise our chances of success.

359
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,010
Jo Mal Saeng.

360
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,390
Yes, Your Highness.

361
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,300
I will come up with a plan.

362
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:42,930
Third, we have to secretly take out the hidden weapons in Banchon.

363
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,770
Master and I will be in charge of it.

364
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,610
Yes, we will.

365
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:54,080
If you fail at taking removing the weapons, we will come to an end even before we begin.

366
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,220
I am aware of that, Your Highness. Don't worry.

367
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:05,520
From now until the day of the rebellion,

368
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,300
don't do anything and be calm and composed.

369
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,320
You have to wait

370
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,740
as if you're dead.

371
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:29,350


372
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,750
 6 days later, a day before the expedition, August 26, 1398, the morning of rebellion day 

373
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,070
Leader. Tomorrow is the expedition.

374
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,230
Are you all done with the preparations.

375
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,900
Why did you bring this?

376
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,630
This is dried fermented bean paste.

377
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,000
Put it in Bang Ji's luggage.

378
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,410
If he eats this, he won't have stomachaches and he will be strong.

379
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,060
Here.

380
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,370
Grandmother! You're here?

381
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,880
Yes.

382
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,380
You brought something again, didn't you? You brought beef jerky yesterday,

383
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,760
Moo Hyul says that there's too much and he can't bring it all

384
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,480
so I'm just sharing it.

385
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,770
Did... Moo Hyul not say anything?

386
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,550
About what?

387
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,890
It's nothing.

388
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:45,210
I should go see Moo Hyul one more time.

389
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:56,660
If Moo Hyul didn't say anything to Grandma, then nothing's wrong, right?

390
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,110
Are you anxious?

391
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,070
I am.

392
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,100
Like you said, if Prince Jeong An

393
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,480
is going to do something, he can only do it today.

394
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,700
He will surely take out the weapons

395
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,260
and if something goes wrong, Banchon will...

396
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,320
We have to hope that nothing bad happens.

397
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,860
Tomorrow is finally the expedition day.

398
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,580
That's right.

399
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,120
Isn't that Woo Hak Joo?

400
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:39,400
Yes. After his exile, he was appointed as manager of the book storage in Seonggyungwan.

401
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,880
A book storage manager at that age?

402
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,230
Uncle, you have to stay safe.
 (Jeong Gi Joon: Jeong Do Kwang's son) 

403
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,110
Yes. Until the day I return,

404
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,240
you must be healthy and do well in your studies.

405
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,100
Yes, Uncle.

406
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,990
Right, right. Eat.

407
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,460
Aigoo. My Lord.

408
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,640
So you were eating here, Bang Ji?

409
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,140
You should eat with your sister today.

410
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm thinking of going there in a bit.

411
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,310
Okay.

412
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,170
Make sure to take care of our Moo Hyul.

413
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,010
Also, you have to come back alive, okay?

414
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:36,070
Don't worry too much. We're not going to war right away.

415
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,600
Bang Ji, come see me for a bit. Come here.

416
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,530
This is made from a jujube tree that got hit by lightning.

417
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,230
It's really expensive.

418
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:03,050
If you wear this, all the arrows will move away from you.

419
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,790
While thinking of getting it for our Moo Hyul, I thought of getting you one as well.

420
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,750
Thank you.

421
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,240
It would be great if no one got hurt and everyone returned safely.

422
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,220
We have to. I will do my best.

423
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,600
It seems that Banchon is also finding it's place.

424
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,660
You have worked hard. You did well.

425
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,840
It's nothing. Ajussi Pal Bong, Ajussi Sang Man,

426
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,000
and the people, who used to stay in the Gaegyeong's Banchon, have always been good.

427
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,850
No. You went around Banchon every day meeting the people, without missing anyone,

428
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:11,230
listening to people's problems and resolving any conflicts. You are doing a very good job.

429
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,670
It's nice to hear compliments.

430
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,570
It's all thanks to your permission.

431
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:30,520
In the end, I couldn't solve that problem.

432
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,560
Pardon?

433
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,200
I have planned the country and have pondered on it but

434
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,560
I couldn't solve the communication with the people.

435
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,200
That...

436
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:50,160
Do you really think that the people are the foundation and roots?

437
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,740
I'm sorry. I went to Jeokryunam by coincidence.

438
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:07,370
Inside the hearts of Sadaebu who practice politics, the people have to be the only foundation.

439
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,730
But the day that the people become the foundation and center of the world

440
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,650
is still far away.

441
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,750
Why do you think so?

442
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,070
The people are in charge of production.

443
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,090
The people have no time to spare.

444
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,350
They're too busy to be enlightened.

445
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:33,550
Of course, a few people learn to read and write for at least a little bit.

446
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:41,210
But it's impossible for a lot of people.

447
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,170
If you will keep on thinking about it,

448
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:50,050
you will also be able to solve that problem.

449
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,010
You've piled it all up, right?

450
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,170
It will be done in a bit.

451
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,360
Okay. Let's go.

452
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,040
What about that gunpowder?

453
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,160
They didn't mention gunpowder. Let's just put in the weapons.

454
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,200
Moo Hyul!

455
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,910
Moo Hyul! Moo Hyul!

456
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,420
Where did he go when tomorrow is the expedition? Moo Hyul!

457
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,630
Is he here?

458
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,050
Moo Hyul, are you here?

459
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,400
What is that?

460
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,040
- Ah! My waist!
- Be careful.

461
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,770
My waist.

462
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,180
What is all this?

463
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,190
Noonim!

464
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,640
These... These are swords!

465
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,050
- Grandmother.
- Noonim.

466
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,920
What are all these?

467
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,750
This... If it's in Banchon...

468
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,090
It will be a problem.

469
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,600
Just what is this? What are you doing?

470
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,820
Grandma.

471
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,120
Hurry and answer me!

472
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:35,050
Tonight, Prince Jeong An will attack Lord Sam Bong.

473
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,950
Noonim. Noonim!

474
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:48,830
T-Then are you... going to fight Bang Ji?

475
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:54,030
No. We have planned to lure Bang Ji away.

476
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,570
Moo Hyul.

477
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,160
Quit. Stop this. Don't go, Moo Hyul.

478
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,180
Moo Hyul. I don't need anything.

479
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,010
I don't need anything. Nothing!

480
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,650
I can't quit.

481
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,330
Noonim. Moo Hyul can't quit.

482
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,150
Why?

483
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,730
You told me to be successful, Grandma.

484
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,170
Being successful means being responsible.

485
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,550
Young Gyu Hyungnim also died while taking responsibility.

486
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,800
Prince Jeong An has taken responsibility for our family until now.

487
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,570
This is something that I have to do. It's my duty.

488
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,770
My goodness.

489
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:46,700
Moo Hyul, then when all of this is over, quit.

490
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:52,340
Answer me. When everything is over, you're going to quit, right?

491
00:41:53,380 --> 00:42:02,170
Right, Moo Hyul. I also want you to quit when this is over.

492
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:12,100
Yes. If this goes well for His Highness,

493
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,820
If it goes well, I will quit lightheartedly.

494
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,160
If by any chance, it doesn't work,

495
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,900
I will still quit.

496
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,700
Aigoo. That's right.

497
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,890
Promise me. Promise.

498
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,790
Okay. I understand.

499
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,550
Grandma, promise me one thing too.

500
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:48,750
If this goes wrong,

501
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:56,290
you mustn't worry about me and you have to run without looking back.

502
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,670
Promise me. Do you understand?

503
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,230
Okay.

504
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,890
You have to take this out, right?

505
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:21,430
It's dangerous if you two take it out. I'll have to move it. It's safer with me.

506
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,930
Okay. Now.

507
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:33,830
It's okay. I'm not going as a battle soldier but as Elder Sam Bong's bodyguard.

508
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,170
Also, you know that your brother was the Viper.

509
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:44,470
Fine. I was worried about you when we were young but now you're capable.

510
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,370
Right.

511
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,970
 Just for tonight. 

512
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,290
 If nothing happens tonight... 

513
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,490
Brother, can't you sleep here tonight?

514
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,040
Elder Sam Bong is busy today.

515
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,790
I see.

516
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,600
What time do you think it will end?

517
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,140
About ten in the evening.

518
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,780
Even if it's late, it would be nice if you could sleep here.

519
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,800
It's just because I want to make you breakfast. Do you understand?

520
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,880
Yes. Thank you.

521
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,040
Wow! What is all this?

522
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,580
This is going to the military supplies office.

523
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,380
Seonggyungwan is saving up on rice. This is from that. I'm going to deliver it there.

524
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,560
You're talking about the military provisions for the expedition, right?

525
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,780
Take care on your way.

526
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:57,370


527
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:10,250
Noonim, it's here. We're almost there.

528
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,430
Where are you going?

529
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:19,410
Ah! You surprised me! Why are you appearing all of a sudden?

530
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,300
What did I do wrong for you to react that way?

531
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,800
But what are all these?

532
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:31,520
It's rice. We're going to deliver military provisions to the military supplies office.

533
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,350
I see.

534
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,760
Why is the rice so soft and squishy?

535
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,030
Well, rice is...

536
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,170
Wait a second.

537
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:01,120
This is... What's inside?

538
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,480
- This is just...
- It's rice.

539
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,380
Aigoo. That!

540
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,470
Wait. Look here.

541
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,670
What are you doing?

542
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,350
-Swords in Banchon?
-Lower your voice.

543
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,000
We'll have a hard time with this. Why are you doing this?

544
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,460
Look here, Sang Man.

545
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,160
Please spare us this one time. Just this once.

546
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,600
If something happens, the whole of Banchon will be shattered.

547
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,330
That's why just this once...

548
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,670
I'm sorry, Ajussi. Just for today.

549
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,190
Hurry.

550
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,330
I will tell you about the Hwasadan report from the Mainland.
 (Songhyeonbang: Nam Eun's vacation house) 

551
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,090
Right now Ju Che (Zhu Di) has gone to Bookpyeong (Beiping) from Shimyang (Shenyang).

552
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:08,370
Of the main forces of Liaodong, 20,000 seem to have followed.

553
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,550
Then did Ju Che make his decision?

554
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,730
We can't make a conclusion for sure yet.

555
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,970
Looking at the strategical standpoints between Ju Yoon Moon (Zhu Yunwen) and Ju Che,

556
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,050
it is true that Ju Che (Zhu Di) is at a disadvantage.

557
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,270
But Ju Yoon Moon's close people

558
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,130
will not just let Ju Che (Zhu Di) be.

559
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:32,170
Also, Ju Che will never take it while doing nothing.
 (Jang Ji Hwa) (Lee Geun) 

560
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,150
That's where our expedition's success lies.

561
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,270
Is it over?

562
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,930
No. They're still talking.

563
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,430
I only made my report.

564
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,130
Right.

565
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,480
Tomorrow will be the expedition.

566
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,010
A day like this finally comes.

567
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,990
Are you not scared?

568
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:08,470
I'm scared and worried.

569
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,110
This.

570
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,320
You're the only one who doesn't have something like this.

571
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:02,290
When you go into war, this will keep you a bit safer.

572
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,840
At that time,

573
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,240
after the Chilseok Festival in the Western district...

574
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,790
 Hurry and do it. 

575
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:35,950
Making clothes was really difficult for me.

576
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,420
 Go. I don't even want to see your face. 

577
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,160
 Go. 

578
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:56,260
So take this and don't say anything.

579
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,430
Hey.

580
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,790
This.

581
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,010
I would like it if you wear it.

582
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:45,840
Grandma Myo Sang gave this to you saying that you should safely come back after the war.

583
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,780
I'm more worried about you.

584
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,470
I'm not even here and the Nameless will still be in Hanyang.

585
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:59,900
I'm lending it to you.

586
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:06,420
When I come back, make sure to return it to me.

587
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,360
♫  I can't say that name  ♫

588
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:21,700
♫  so i buried it in my heart  ♫

589
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,690
When I return,

590
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,770
at that time,

591
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,550
♫  Because I cannot put up with you  ♫

592
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,670
will we be able to dream together?

593
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,390
♫  Only tears that resemble you  ♫

594
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:48,730
♫  flow.  ♫

595
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,250
♫  My breath gets cut off  ♫

596
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:56,490
♫  It's carved in my body  ♫

597
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:03,450
♫  The more I forget, the more it hurts  ♫

598
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:10,330
♫  In my frozen heart that has seemed to stopped  ♫

599
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:17,430
♫  Time that is you flows  ♫

600
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,280
It's the curfew bell.

601
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:30,000
We're starting now.

602
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,820
Husband.

603
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,050
Whatever happens, I will not regret it.

604
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,570
Hey, ladies!
 (Lee Bang Won's house) 

605
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,430
 Lee Bang Gan's house 

606
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,080
What about Sam Bong?

607
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,760
He's in Nam Eun's vacation house, Songhyeonbang.

608
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,480
- Let's go!
- Yes!

609
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,720
I pray, I pray.

610
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,920
Please let our Moo Hyul come back safely.

611
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,580
Please let Bang Ji come back safely as well.

612
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,340
Grandma.

613
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,240
You're here, Leader?

614
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,740
I see that you're praying.

615
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,920
Yes. I'm very anxious because the expedition is tomorrow.

616
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,440
By any chance, have you seen Ajussi Sang Man?

617
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,400
I haven't seen him.

618
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,700
Ah...

619
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,180
A while ago, he said he had urgent thing at his hometown because his relatives came.

620
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,320
He said that and left.

621
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,800
Relatives?

622
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,180
He said he'll be back tomorrow morning.

623
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,200
Yes. I understand.

624
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,540
So 20 days after crossing the Yalu River,

625
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:41,740
from Pasabu (Dandong) to Liaoyang headquarters, we'll capture them all.

626
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,850
Liaodong's center, Shimyang Fortress,

627
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:37,310
in less than 40 days,

628
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,290
will fall to our army.

629
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:24,300


630
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,010
 Six Flying Dragons 

631
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,230
 I am very tired, Bang Won.
