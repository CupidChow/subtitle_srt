00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,650
 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

3
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:54,210
Then, did you think that I would share power with those people?

4
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,730
 Nameless. I will now take away 

5
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,670
 your 700-years of life. 

6
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,610
Lee Bang Won is the similar to Sam Bong?
 Episode 49 

7
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,150
He has never gone against Sam Bong's political views. He always admired them.

8
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,790
But Prince Jeong An understands human desires.

9
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,310
No. He only understands his own desires.

10
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,030
But do you think Lee Bang Won will understand Nameless' desires?

11
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,830
I will confirm it for you.

12
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,870
How?

13
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,230
 Won 

14
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,250
 Lee Shin Jeok 

15
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,510
How can I manage the country if I just leave an organization like Nameless alone?

16
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,550
That's right, but how?

17
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,850
We can't even find out their true nature.

18
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,510
We have to attack three of their foundations.

19
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,130
Foundations?

20
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,810
First...

21
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,290
 The reason why Sam Bong took Silla documents from the puclication office... 

22
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,230
Eunuchs, court ladies... The organization with people from the palace.

23
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,630
Second.

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,290
 Then what is going to happen to the system in which the king seeks advice from the high priest? 

25
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,970
Buddhism and the Buddhist temple organization.

26
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,930
Third.

27
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,930
 She's a merchant group leader who's also famous on the Mainland. 

28
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,390
Merchants and merchant groups.

29
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,950
Buddhism, merchants, and people in the palace.

30
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,190
We must stir up those three foundations

31
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,990
to get rid the central figures of Nameless  at the same time.

32
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,410
Yes. The Buddhism expulsion policy, a plan to replace the court lady organization,

33
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,610
and the ones regarding merchant groups, I'll arrange it.

34
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,690
Until you're done with the preparations,

35
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,590
I will maintain a very close relationship with those people.

36
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,430
Does this make sense?

37
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,210
You're not the one who distributed these contribution awards, right?

38
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:40,330
It's not Hyungnim. It's His Highness.

39
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,910
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:49,810
How could you only put Bang Won's people down as the first class contributors?

41
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,990
So what do you want me to do?

42
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,590
Are you the king or is it Bang Won?

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,630
Hey! Bang Gan!

44
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:07,910
Your Highness Hyungnim, how is something like this possible?

45
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,110
How could you be a second class contributor, when even Jo Joon, who didn't do anything, is selected as first class?

46
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,630
The award meriting should not be done this way.
 (He mixes up the words) 

47
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,130
 Park Po 

48
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,530
It's awarding merits accordingly, my Lord.

49
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,070
That's right. Right. This is why you're my tactician.

50
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,530
Are you just going to sit still?

51
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,950
I can't! What do you think we should do?

52
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,190
What we are lacking is an information organization. So how about we...

53
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,970
Prince Hoe An, what brings you here?

54
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,870
Am I not allowed to come to here?

55
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,130
No. I'm just glad to see you.

56
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,950
You didn't get any compensation from Bang Won after making contributions, right?

57
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,710
That kid has always had no manners.

58
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,430
I see that you have a guest. I'll be going, Monk.

59
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,890
Okay. Let's go in.

60
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,430
 You'll probably die within an hour. 

61
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,050
I found you, Nameless.
 (Cheok Sa Gwang) 

62
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,170
Prince Hoe An has a lot of complaints. Monitor his movements.

63
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,810
Yes, I understand.

64
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,490
Also, did you still not find Jeong Do Kwang?

65
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,730
He's on the wanted list of each of the government offices and we've arrested Banchon people. We're currently interrogating them.

66
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,770
Banchon people? Why?

67
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,450
It was a person from Banchon who went to Seonghyeonbang and told them about our rebellion,

68
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,890
and the person who died while we were going after Lee Bang Ji and Jeong Do Kwang is also from Banchon.

69
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,790
Yes. A considerable number of Banchon people

70
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,590
are originally from Jeong Do Jeon's information group. They need to be interrogated.

71
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,510
Putting the recent incident aside, we can't leave such foul people inside the capital.

72
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,830
Do you have a different opinion?

73
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,650
What you all said is right.

74
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,830
Please proceed with it strictly and thoroughly interrogate them.

75
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,410
Then, regarding the people of Banchon—

76
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,690
Don't mess with the leader there.

77
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,890
Let's end this here.

78
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,530
Who ordered you to go to Seonghyeonbang and inform Jeong Do Jeon?

79
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,070
I just went there to tell someone I know to escape.

80
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,310
My Lord, the people of Banchon didn't do anything wrong.

81
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,870
What greed would Gab Boon have? It's just human nature—

82
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,090
Wake up.

83
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,750
In the end, aren't you all Jeong Do Jeon's information group?

84
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,550
If you put it that way, at one point, we were also Prince Jeong An's info—

85
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,290
The person who placed all of you in Banchon

86
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,790
is also Jeong Do Jeon.

87
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,730
If you don't want to be named a traitor, never do this again.

88
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,430
 Prince Jeong An! 

89
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,170
 Do you know what he did? 

90
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,190
 Just look a step ahead. Just one step. 

91
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,390
Warrior-nim!

92
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,930
All of our people might die. Warrior-nim...

93
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,210
I can't do it.

94
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,010
Why?

95
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,990
Because I understand.

96
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,590
I understand this whole situation. Politics, power...

97
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,070
It has always been like this.

98
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,550
Lady, you too.

99
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,870
You actually understand it too, right?

100
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,910
Seonggyungwan was dominated by Jeong Do Jeon and it's the same for Banchon.

101
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,090
Do you think that politics and power

102
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,450
will just leave that be?

103
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,650
You do understand.

104
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:13,410
I can't understand. How could I understand that?

105
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,590
Even if the whole world understands, as the leader of Banchon seeing her people die,

106
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,970
how can I just nod my head and understand that this kind of thing can happen to them too?

107
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,650
I'm also not sure,

108
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,510
but I decided to just look one step ahead.

109
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,290
Isn't this moment that one step ahead?

110
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,550
Grandma.

111
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,510
What happened to these?

112
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,040
Don't say anything. I just have to clean it up.

113
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,250
Who did it?

114
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,690
So many people of Banchon have been arrested.

115
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,430
Would those people feel good?

116
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,630
The whole village knows that the weapons came from here and all that happened.

117
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,760
Moo Hyul, you said you would quit.

118
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,280
When are you going to stop doing it?

119
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:52,670
 Isn't this moment that one step ahead? 

120
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,390
 Is it now? 

121
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,480
What?

122
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
The people of Banchon who got arrested...

123
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,010
Why would you care about that?

124
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,100
They're people I've been with for a long time and I've grown fond of them.

125
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,880
Fond?

126
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,220
You probably become deeply attached to them.

127
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,950
Should I practice politics using affection?

128
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,590
Will it become a good country?

129
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,740
It's the investigation office's job. They'll probably take care of it.

130
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,510
Your Highness, I...

131
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,250
What?

132
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,890
I want to go to my hometown.

133
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,470
Go ahead. But you must come back within ten days.

134
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,820
No. I want to retire back to my hometown.

135
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,570
It's hard.

136
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:23,350
I'm having a hard time too. Stop talking nonsense.

137
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:35,530
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

138
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,700
Pardon?

139
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,010
It's a draft of the Buddhism expulsion policy.

140
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,090
Because you said you're investigating the truth,

141
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,780
take a look to compare, review and add anything.

142
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,460
Yes.

143
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,300
 Will Prince Jeong An enact Teacher Sam Bong's Buddhism exclusion as it is? 

144
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,180
My Lord.

145
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,880
You were alive?

146
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,600
The same thing?

147
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,980
Is Lee Bang Won planning to practice the same politics that Sam Bong did?

148
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,600
That's right.

149
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,440
This is Lord Ha Ryun's appeal regarding the Buddhism exclusion.

150
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,200
This will do.

151
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,260
What are you going to do?

152
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,180
What is this?

153
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,760
This is a draft of an appeal written by Ha Ryun.

154
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,340
It's about the Buddhism reform.

155
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,080
Is Prince Jeong An really

156
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,640
going to continue everything that Sam Bong was  going to do?

157
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,840
Mugeuk, this has already started.

158
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,480
We can't just let this be.

159
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,880
I will get rid of Prince Jeong An.

160
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,640
But how?

161
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,040
Prince Jeong An, who we used as our sword to stop the Liaodong conquest, is no longer of use.

162
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,460
Prepare a banquet for Prince Jeong An.

163
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,120
We are going to break that sword.

164
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,200
 Lee Bang Won. 

165
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,900
Aigoo, Moon Dong!

166
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,720
What did you do wrong. Moon Dong?

167
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,000
Just what is happening?

168
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,920
Just how many is it now?

169
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,590
How can the investigation office torture a young child like that?

170
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,410
Let's go.

171
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,620
Aigooo, Moon Dong!

172
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,910
Aiggo, Moon Dong!

173
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,230
Stay still.

174
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,840
It's here! It's this place! Here!

175
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,460
Moon Dong came back dead.

176
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,440
Oh my goodness!

177
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,740
My goodness. Such a young child.

178
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,500
To gain wealth and honor for his family,

179
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,170
you make this neighborhood look like this?

180
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,640
Aigoo. What are you saying?

181
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,210
I was just...

182
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:24,380
So it's true. Getting involved in politiccs is enough for a person to get kicked out of Banchon.

183
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,710
My goodness. You were holding piles of weapons in here?

184
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,180
Why are you doing this?

185
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,640
Just have your high and mighty grandson to beat us all to death!

186
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,390
No. It's not like that.

187
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,430
Grandma.

188
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,170
Grandma. What's wrong?

189
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,590
Who did this?

190
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,290
No. It's not that, Moo Hyul.

191
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,300
These bastards.

192
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,770
No!

193
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,930
Moo Hyul, you must not. No!

194
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,080
Let me go, Grandma! This doesn't make sense. What did we do wrong?

195
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,070
We were wrong.

196
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,790
We did wrong.

197
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,810
If it were me too...  If something bad happened to you because of someone

198
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,670
I wouldn't have stayed still.

199
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:50,130
Moon Dong, that young child, died after being tortured at the investigation office.

200
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,400
Moo Hyul, let's leave.

201
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,270
Don't live committing crimes anymore, Moo Hyul.

202
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,510
Moo Hyul, let's just leave now.

203
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,060
I will arrange a place somewhere else so

204
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,460
get out of Banchon.

205
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,360
I will leave.

206
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,710
I do understand what you're feeling but—

207
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,430
I...

208
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,540
The reason why I followed Your Highness,

209
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,350
do you remember?

210
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,610
Politics that would make the people smile.

211
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,620
But Your Highness,

212
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,780
who...

213
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,500
Who is smiling right now?

214
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,760
Have you seen a smiling person?

215
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,150
 I want to feel satisfaction when you make people smile. 

216
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,210
Am I feeling satisfaction

217
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,460
beside Your Highness right now?

218
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,260
Then, leave

219
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,510
before I change my mind.

220
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,990
Also, give those to your grandmother.

221
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,310
Your Highness!

222
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,260
Can I say something?

223
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:45,250
Please save my Banchon people, Your Highness.

224
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,350
Because of this incident, there were already three people

225
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,950
who died after being tortured at the investigation office.

226
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,310
- Please.
- I can't.

227
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,280
They didn't do anything wrong.

228
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,280
Even if they didn't commit anything wrong,

229
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,630
people who are connected to the traitor Sam Bong

230
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,880
cannot be released without justification

231
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,590
and cannot stay in the capital.

232
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,850
Your Highness!

233
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
That's why

234
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,120
I told you to do your best, for you to survive.

235
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,730
It was impossible no matter what I did.

236
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,770
If they've been arrested for being connected to Elder Sam Bong,

237
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,720
then we never had a way out to begin with.

238
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,810
You...

239
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,370
What's with that look?

240
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,140
"Bug, spit out Bang Won."

241
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,870
- Why not do that?
- That kind of childhood joke,

242
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,530
what use would it be?

243
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,780
You're right. Its meaningless.

244
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,880
 Aren't you hesitating because you're afraid 

245
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,250
 that the world will turn against you and that you'll be lonely? 

246
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,270
 No. It's not that. 

247
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,670
 I will write a poem. A warm poem. 

248
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,570
 Right. That's right. 

249
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,460
 Prince Hoe An has lots of complaints. 

250
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,740
 I don't have other intentions. Do you understand? 

251
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,070
 Right. That's right. 

252
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,440
 I will rip your mouth with my own hands. 

253
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,210
 Even a dog or a pig 

254
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,530
 won't kill their brother and teacher! 

255
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,290
 No, Yeon Hee! 

256
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,770
 Am I feeling satisfaction 

257
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,400
 beside Your Highness right now? 

258
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,980
 I will leave. 

259
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,150
I will leave.

260
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,320
- What?
- If I take everyone and leave,

261
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,190
can't I do that?

262
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,240
Yes. Politics is like that so

263
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,360
it would be difficult for Banchon people who were originally information group members

264
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,170
to stay inside the capital, right?

265
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,480
If you will save their lives and release them,

266
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,260
we will go to a place with nothing and quietly live there.

267
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,140
Please let me leave with them.

268
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,240
You will leave?

269
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,630
No. Stay with me.

270
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,490
- Your Highness.
- Marry me...

271
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,500
- Anyway...
- I'll do it.

272
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,520
I will do it.

273
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,740
If you tell me to stay beside you, I will. If you tell me to marry you, I will do so.

274
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,300
Whatever it is, I will do as you say.

275
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,190
So

276
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,150
please release my Banchon people.

277
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,110
Is that true?

278
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,530
Why are you doing this?

279
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,500
What are those Banchon people?

280
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,390
In the morning before Sam Bong died,

281
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,480
I met brother.

282
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,110
I met Ajussi Sam Bong too.

283
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,970
If I had told them about the armory at that time,

284
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,620
what would have happened to this country and to Your Highness?

285
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,240
Also, why did I do that?

286
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,840
Was it because I love you so much

287
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,760
that I didn't tell them about the armory,

288
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,820
not caring whether my brother would die or not?

289
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,070
No. I did it because the many people here would suffer

290
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,970
if it was revealed that there was an armory inside Banchon.

291
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,860
But...

292
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,580
One way or the other,

293
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,540
it still ended like this.

294
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,420
In the end, the people of this age

295
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,090
couldn't do anything.

296
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,580
Still, the people who are locked up in the investigation office,

297
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,260
even if it's hard,

298
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,240
will believe in a nobody like me,

299
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,600
saying that I will do something.

300
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,250
That's why I can't throw away those people's hearts.

301
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,800
Is that all?

302
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,710
That's why you're marrying me?

303
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:36,790
You were someone who wouldn't bend your will even if they held a sword to your neck.

304
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,370
You said you would never marry me even if you died.

305
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,640
You were like that.

306
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,110
But

307
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,780
without any feelings at all,

308
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,360
just for of that reason,

309
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,800
you will marry me?

310
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,840
Is that the only reason? Why?

311
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,820
Because you're a powerful person.

312
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,460
What?

313
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,170
 - Why do you ignore a person's good will?
- You're a person with power. 

314
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,690
 All of the powerful people I've seen 

315
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,080
 only stole what's ours. 

316
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,810
 Here. Look closely. 

317
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,930
 I'm not that kind of person. 

318
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,160
People like us, no.

319
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,790
Someone who can make all the people of this country

320
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,260
disappear without a trace.

321
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,200
You've become a powerful person like that.

322
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,210
You...

323
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,560
Just stay there like that for a second.

327

♫  My heart that I've concealed, you  ♫

328
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,620

329
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,050
♫  came down as tears  ♫

330
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,550
 I'm trying to not be that kind of person. 

331
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,040
 I tried to not be that. 

332
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,970
 To you. 

333
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,480
 I came back to the beginning. 

334
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,770
 We tried so hard. 

335

00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,810

342
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,350
Go.

343
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,850
Pardon?

344
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,270
Go where you want to go

345
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,730
with those you want so terribly.

346
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,050
Then...

347
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,930
I will release them all.

348
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,510
Go.

349
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,150
 Moo Hyul... Boon Yi... 

350
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,530
 I will get stronger now, right? 

351
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,770
 Also, I'll be lonelier. 

352
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:05,110
I'm a bit late. Were you talking?

353
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,250
These people asked you to go out on a trip.

354
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,390
A trip?

355
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:18,590
Yes. My superiors said that since you've worked so hard, we should get together and catch up.

356
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,910
Of course, we'll end up talking about politics too.

357
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,030
Yes. That's great. When should we go?

358
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,570
How about in two days? We'll arrange a fabulous place.

359
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,310
Yes. I'll meet you there then.

360
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,830
Mugeuk, Moo Hyul is retiring to his hometown.

361
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,130
Is that so?

362
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,370
I guess Lee Bang Won's heavenly luck is all out too.

363
00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:01,050
Mugeuk, how are we going to proceed regarding Prince Jeong An's death?

364
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:09,710
I will make it as if Lee Bang Ji killed Prince Jeong An.

365
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,930
 It seems that she still doesn't know that Lee Bang Ji is her son. 

366
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,290
While Lee Bang Won and Jeong Do Jeon were fighting for intense power,

367
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:31,190
in the end,  as a bodyguard seeking revenge, they killed each other. That's how it will be recorded in history.

368
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,930
Yes, of course we should do that.

369
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:42,910
Oh, and here is the Bichisa.

370
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,590
 Bichisa? 

371
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,530
You actually managed to get it?

372
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,730
The only colorless and odorless poison that exists.

373
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,110
In the middle of tomorrow's fight, kill Yook San too.

374
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,750
I understand. But why are you making Lee Bang Ji  Prince Jeong An's assassin?

375
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,770
It will be hard for Bang Ji to live in this country anyway.

376
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,910
We have to resolve his grudge and open a different path for him.

377
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,830
It's tomorrow.

378
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,830
Okay.

379
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:31,050
Ddang Sae. What are you going to do after that?

380
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,570
After killing Lee Bang Won, what are you going to do with your life?

381
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,770
Don't go back to Boon Yi. She'll be in danger.

382
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,070
Go to the Mainland with me. You will be able to dream of something else.

383
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,510
The only thing I'll be doing with you is this.

384
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,730
 Pardon? 

385
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:16,590
Please process it as if the Banchon people in the investigation bureau were sent to the northern labor house.

386
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,710
Release all of them at Mapo port.

387
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,710
Ah, yes. I understand.

388
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,250
Husband, Moo Hyul and Boon Yi have arrived.

389
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,770
They want to see you.

390
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,250
His Highness has entered his bedroom.

391
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,070
Then, I will be coming again early tomorrow morning.

392
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:01,230
He will be leaving for Jeongryu early tomorrow morning. You don't have to come again.

393
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,670
You, too.

394
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:12,050
Does that mean that he doesn't want to see us?

395
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,930
You must be upset but it's not like you don't understand.

396
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:24,510
Goodbye. You've worked hard all this time.

397
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,010
It's been a while, Leader.

398
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,410
What's the matter?

399
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,630
I wanted to meet you.

400
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:49,330
Ajussi Oak and Myeong Hee died.

401
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,790
Do you know?

402
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,790
Yes, I do.

403
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,430
That day, something bad happened in Banchon.

404
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,870
Were you involved in it?

405
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,810
Yes.

406
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,950
That day, Eun Ho died too.

407
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,090
I have really become alone now.

408
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,510
- Then...
- Excuse me.

409
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,990
Do you want to come with us?

410
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,870
Everyone is in a situation similar to yours.

411
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:38,090
We will leave tomorrow. It will be in the hour of Mi at Mapo Port.

412
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,690
If we all live comforting each other, good things will happen.

413
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,650
It's an island called Muhaengdo, and it's abundant with water--

414
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,410
There's something that I must do tomorrow.

415
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,710
You said that you're by yourself now. What do you have to do?

416
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,650
Five...

417
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,070
I'm going to ask the five people to pay for the things they are responsible for.

418
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,050
There was something I was jealous of about Tae Mi.

419
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,710
What is it?

420
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,570
In this world, there are people who use other and people who get used.

421
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,710
We have no choice but to be used.

422
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,290
But Tae Mi overcame that.

423
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,330
I'm not saying this because he became a powerful authority.

424
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,290
I saw him die by your hands.

425
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:45,050
I thought that he died after getting used his whole life

426
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:53,190
but seeing him in his last moments, he actually lived for himself.

427
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,270
And so?

428
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:11,930
Is that revenge for you?

429
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:28,570
♫  The father collapses from the sword  ♫

430
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,150
♫  while the child dies from taxes  ♫

431
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,550
It's going to feel disheartening and empty.

432
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:42,440
♫  In the Royal Palace where ashes fly,  ♫

433
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,020
♫  just a wail of pain can be heard  ♫

434
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,600
 Go to Mapo port. Someone will be waiting there. 

435
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,290
♫  Nameless bird in the sky,  ♫

436
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:03,600
♫  why do you cry so sorrowfully?  ♫

437
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,130
♫  The place where wild flowers fall  ♫

438
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,760
♫  cannot be found anyway  ♫

439
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,720
Leader!

440
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,300
How did this happen?

441
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,510
Oh, Gab Boon.

442
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,240
Unnie. Unnie.

443
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,640
Are you okay? Are you really alright?

444
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,770
Of course.

445
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,690
But, Unni, why are you here?

446
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,300
Let's leave together.

447
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,200
Leave? Not to a labor place?

448
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,460
I was thinking that we got released from our sufferings. So it was because of Leader.

449
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
No.

450
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,110
Leader.

451
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,030
Thank you. Really.

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

453
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,690
Leader, is someone else coming?

454
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,130
Madam Chungjoo.

455
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,750
Let's just wait for a little bit.

456
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,090
Madam Chungjoo?

457
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,590
Well, she's indeed from Banchon.

458
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,020
Yesterday, she asked me who was the owner of the armory. What could it be for?

459
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,580
The armory?

460
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,670
Are you really going without seeing His Highness?

461
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,070
Yes. I came to see him early but he has already left.

462
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,570
Is that so?

463
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,350
I guess we're leaving without even saying goodbye.

464
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,600
Let's go.

465
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,940
Yes.

466
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,720
Madam Chungjoo is not coming. Let's go.

467
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,320
 Please wait a second! 

468
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,480
Maeng Soon, what's wrong?

469
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,680
Madam Chungjoo came and asked me to give this to you.

470
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:41,450
 I was really happy when you asked me to come. 

471
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,050
 I will never forget it. 

472
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,730
 I have some jewelry left, but I don't think I will need it anymore 

473
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,290
 so I give it to you to use it well. 

474
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,190
 Also, I'm not from the Chungjoo clan. 

475
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,510
 I'm from Goksan. 

476
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,390
Goksan?

477
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,580
 How strong is Cheok Sa Gwang? 

478
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,990
 She's born a woman so she was in a bit of a disadvantage 

479
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,270
 but she's the heir to the Goksan swordsmanship. 

480
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,630
 Perhaps... 

481
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,630
You said that Madam Chungjoo asked you yesterday about who owned the armory, right?

482
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:29,130
Yeah. And what else... She also asked how to get to Neoreunma.

483
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,380
 He will be leaving for Jeongryu early tomorrow morning. 

484
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,460
 There's something I must do tomorrow. 

485
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,410
 The owner of the armory is Bang Won. 

486
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,050
I will be back in a bit.

487
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,650
Welcome, Grand Prince.

488
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,970
Please have a seat.

489
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,380
No matter how I think about it, I don't think this is right.

490
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,410
I have to say something to His Highness before I go.

491
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,390
Yes. Go and hurry back.

492
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:52,330
I thought I was going to be bothered to death because you kept on stopping since earlier.

493
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,630
Aigoo.

494
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,520
Give it to me.

495
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,060
I'll be back soon.

496
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,450
 Have you been well? 

497
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,430
 Nameless? 

498
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,650
 Why would Nameless be here? I have to tell him right away. 

499
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,970
About politics,

500
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,970
we have to communicate well.

501
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:45,660
In a way, we have to know how to listen to wise opinions,

502
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,250
just like Our Highness.

503
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,620
Yes, that's correct.

504
00:47:54,010 --> 00:48:00,630
How much did we suffer the other day because of Sam Bong?

505
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,870
That's what I'm saying.

506
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,710
We have to quickly get rid of Lee Bang Won's bodyguards.

507
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,930
Do you understand?

508
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,270
Yes.

509
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,430
Let's go.

510
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,650
I have something to ask.

511
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,630
 Cheok Sa Gwang? 

512
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,570
Your Highness.

513
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:18,360
For the country that will live a thousand years, and for our pact,

514
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,640
let's all have a drink.

515
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,360
Sir.

516
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:50,870
Um...

517
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,930
What's the problem?

518
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,830
A servant of His Highness said she has an urgent message.

519
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,180
Let her enter.

520
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,160
 Mom? 

521
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,140
 What happened? Why is Bang Won with Nameless? 

522
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,460
 Should I just tell him that Cheok Sa Gwang is targeting him? 

523
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:41,530
 No... What if Cheok Sa Gwang is with Nameless? 

524
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,860
 Boon. 

525
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,810
What was the message you came to deliver?

526
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,410
 Why is Boon Yi here? 

527
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:57,110
 What should I do? Should I just scream that it's dangerous? 

528
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,830
 No. Warrior Moo Hyul isn't even here. What if it really gets dangerous... 

529
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,270
Just what kind of message did you come to deliver?

530
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,730
Your Highness.

531
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:43,490
 Goksan swordsmanship. Cheok Sa Gwang. 

532
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,450
What is it?

533
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,430
Did something happen at home?

534
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,230
I...

535
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:08,970
It's a message to spit out the bug.

536
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,990
 Why is she saying that now all of a sudden? 

537
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:24,070
 Please, Bang Won. You need to understand. You can recognize it.  

538
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,950
 Just what... 

539
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,510
 Spit the bug out? 

540
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,930
 I will kill it. 

541
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:35,950
 Before you kill it, can you just tell me once. 

542
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:42,130
 Okay. You bad bug, hurry and spit out Bang Won! 

543
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,150
 Like this? 

544
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:48,990
 Before killing it, one word... 

545
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,190
Okay. I understand.

546
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:06,090
Teacher Ha Ryun. We'll have to talk for a bit.

547
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,870
It's nothing much. I'll be back soon.

548
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:34,050
Why did Banchon's leader come here?

549
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,590
Don't say anything and just walk.

550
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,470
 Boon Yi is not a servant in Prince Jeong An's house. 

551
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,710
Start!

552
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,910
 Boon Yi. 

553
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,720
Brother.

554
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,030
What are you doing? Attack!

555
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,830
 Nameless. 

556
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,070
It's now. Let's go!

557
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,270
Your Highness!

558
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,430
It's Lee Bang Won! Chase Lee Bang Won!

559
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,110
Chase him!

560
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,050
Your Highness.

561
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:58,310
Please have a gentle and easy death.

562
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,410
 I got pushed by strength? 

563
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:27,790
Moo Hyul!

564
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,670
Warrior-nim!

565
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,730
I was late, my Lord.

566
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,510
Can you get us out of here alive?

567
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:55,750
Warrior Moo Hyul! Without any mistake, I will follow your order!

568
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:06,750
 Sixth Dragon
Joseon's best swordsman, Moo Hyul 

569
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:11,690
 Will protect the future Great King Sejong, Lee Do 

570
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:20,510
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

571
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:23,430
 Six Flying Dragons 

572
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:28,370
 The promise that Your Highness made to me as you gave me the hanbok tie... 

573
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:33,470
 The people's dreams. Just don't forget them. 

574
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:37,690
 Then, you won't become the bug. 

575
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:43,510
 That's how Boon Yi will be able to smile somewhere. 

576
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,130
 Be healthy. 

577
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,750
 Final episode tomorrow.
