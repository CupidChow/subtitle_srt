 This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content. 

2
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,370
 I am Eunuch Kim Nae Pyeong. 

3
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,730
 There's a great disaster at the palace right now. 

4
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,790
 This... 

5
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,870
 What about that man called Kim Nae Pyeong? 

6
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,110
 There's no man like that in the Eunuch Ministry nor in the other bureaus. 

7
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,650
 This drawing in the letter! The one who has this drawing took our mom! 

8
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,390
 Are you talking about the palace maid who served Princess Noguk, Yeon Hyang? 

9
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,890
 Yeon Hyang is dead. 

10
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,630
 Your mother is a notorious criminal in Goryeo. 

11
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,710
 What? 

12
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,030
 Because of your mother's mistake, Princess Noguk died. 

13
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,250
 I have discovered the whereabouts of Kim Nae Pyeong. 

14
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,730
 You must expose that identity.  

15
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,650
 You left me in Jang Sam Bong's care. 

16
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,590
 He's Yeon Hyang's son? 

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,310
 Yeon Hyang's son is... the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms. 

18
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,870
That person thinks differently about Lee Seong Gye than what we expected.

19
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,490
That person has made a choice.

20
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,410
Abandon both and leave it to luck.

21
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,210
Leave it to luck?

22
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,130
So that's why that person sent Pyeong.

23
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,360
Why was Pyeong sent to Do Hwa Jeon?

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,310
Jo Min Soo is going to kill Lee Seong Gye and his men at Do Hwa Jeon today.

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,670
What?

26
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,190
It has probably started. It might have already finished too.

27
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,420
So about abandoning them both?

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:35,890
There are a lot of skilled warriors among Lee Seong Gye's men who went to Do Hwa Jeon. I don't even have to mention best swordsman Lee Bang Ji.

29
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:42,300
So the scheme Jo Min Soo planned can either succeed or fail.

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,470
So? Who is Pyeong supposed to kill?

31
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,680
Abandon both? Since that person said to leave it to luck...

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,300
It's probably the victor of the Do Hwa Jeon battle.

33
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,370
If he succeeds, the slaughter in Do Hwa Jeon this time

34
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,450
will be recorded in history as Goryeo's two opposing parties of powerful people killing each other.
 (Gil Seon Mi) 

35
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:16,030
And after that, a great power gap.

36
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:24,920
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

37
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,480
You bastard!

38
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,190
It's a fail.

39
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,450
 Who is that man? 

40
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,730
 The one behind this has been exposed so why did he kill himself?
(Lee Bang Won) 

41
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,210
Father was worried about the war so he covered up for your crimes

42
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,060
and decided to make peace. Why did you do this?

43
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,540
Just why did you do it?

44
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,260
 (Jo Min Soo) 

45
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:26,880
If I don't do it this time, you'll probably attack me next anyway.

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,720
Isn't that so?

47
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,120
 Lee Bang Gwa 

48
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,570
I won't sit and wait for that.

49
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,160
So, are you acknowledging everything?
 (Nam Eun) 

50
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,220
Of course. I planned all of this.

51
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:53,040
There's no one behind me.

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,070
Also, I don't have regrets.

53
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,190
I'm just curious.

54
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,480
About what?

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,520
Why did it fail?

56
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,020
Why did something happen outside?

57
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,790
Just what happened outside?

58
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,300
How did it happen?

59
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,160
I heard that you started it even before they attacked.

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,130
Ah, that... You see...

61
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,120
Moo Hyul!

62
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,740
If you hadn't overturned the tables first,
 (Sam Bong) 

63
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,850
it would've all gone according to Jo Min Soo's plan, even before the Ga Byeol Cho I sent arrived.

64
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,170
Why did you do it?

65
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,980
Ah...
 (Moo Hyul) 

66
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,260
Ten years ago,

67
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:54,230
the Do Dang Triumvirate stole lands from my hometown village in the Western district.

68
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,370
Hong In Bang's servant who killed villagers and made us suffer at that time

69
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,780
was there as Jo Min Soo's servant.

70
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,900
I don't know how Moo Hyul found out but I think that's why he did it.

71
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,870
Yes, that's right. It's exactly that.

72
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,190
The heavens really helped us. That small coincidence saved us all.

73
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:27,050
That's right. That one personal ill-fated relationship changed history. You worked hard.

74
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,460
 Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master 

75
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,360
- What are you doing?
- Why? I'm transferring my chi into the medicine right now.

76
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,280
Seriously, are you not going to do it properly?

77
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,980
Really...

78
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,510
I'm already upset that so many of them got hurt and now you're just screwing around.

79
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:12,800
Amidst all that, our Moo Hyul didn't get hurt much.

80
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,650
That kid really was born with luck.

81
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,630
Noonim, more than luck, it's the power of the Twin Dragons of the East. It's originally that efficient.

82
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,910
Twins Dragons of the East!

83
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,370
You're saying nonsense again. Just do a good job at fanning.

84
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,740
Give me the fan!

85
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,100
Unni, don't worry too much.

86
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,200
Orabi Bang Ji got cut a lot when he was fighting Japanese pirates and I also got very worried,
 (Gab Boon) 

87
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,080
but he really recuperates fast.

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,660
Is that so?
 (Boon Yi) 

89
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,950
So that's how it was.

90
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,150
Ah, I shouldn't have said that.

91
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,260
No. Thank you for being on my brother's side all those times.

92
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,140
It was he who was by my side.

93
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,700
Unni, Orabi likes chestnuts more than dried persimmon.

94
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,390
How did you know?

95
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,120
What? I don't know anything though.

96
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,220
What? Why?

97
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:47,240
No... Actually, there's that night when you got drunk. The day that Lady Yeon Hee fainted.

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,030
On my way to get you some water,

99
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,430
I heard Lady Yeon Hee talking to you when you were sleeping.

100
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,170
I didn't listen on purpose.

101
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,760
She said that she fainted when she saw that guy by coincidence.

102
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,920
She was crying over it. She said she doesn't know why she fainted like a fool.

103
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,060
I'm sorry. I didn't try to listen on purpose.

104
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,670
- You.
- Huh?

105
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:27,430
Seeing you yesterday, I think you're stronger when you're protecting someone.

106
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,790
Really? Right? I was like that, right? Oh, sorry.

107
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,390
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

108
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,720
Lady!

109
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,550
Have a good rest now!

110
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,410
I knew it! I have a talent for protecting people.

111
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,680
Gab Boon gave it to me. She said that you like chestnuts more than dried persimmons.

112
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,430
I guess that now, Gab Boon knows more about you than I do.

113
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,030
That day,

114
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,690
when I left the house,

115
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,670
I went to find the house of one of them.

116
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,930
I was going to kill him,

117
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,000
but that man's daughter and old mother

118
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,440
came out crying.

119
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,380
But do you know what that evil servant said?

120
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,720
Take the child inside, Mother. Hurry.

121
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,860
I was in a daze.

122
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,320
That evil man is also just

123
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,080
a human trying to survive in these turbulent times.

124
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
I couldn't kill him.

125
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,230
So it was like that.

126
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,540
In the end,

127
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,150
that kind of man is also weak.

128
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,790
To live well, he stayed under a powerful person...

129
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,550
That kind of weak person is the worst.

130
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,470
They're people who would find weaker people to step on when they themselves are weak as well.

131
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:12,100
They make weak people loathe each other, ravage each other.

132
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,900
You did well, Brother.

133
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,820
 Yeon Hee 

134
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,090
Boil this and feed it to Ddang Sae.

135
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,170
This is good for quickly healing his wounds.

136
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,160
Why are you not taking it?

137
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,620
Unni, you did well.

138
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,760
That bastard.

139
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,810
Eon Nyeon, her father, and Pal Bong Ajussi.

140
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,570
He's the one who killed all of them.

141
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:26,450
Also, he's the one who stole the land that we cultivated for two years.

142
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,290
He's a really bad person.

143
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,510
I wanted to get revenge

144
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,320
but you did it for me.

145
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Thank you.

146
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,660
Unni. I have a request.

147
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,580
What is it?

148
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,900
I hope that you can personally give him this medicine.

149
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,860
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

150
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,470
Lie down.

151
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,720
I think it will be easier for me to speak that way.

152
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,280
I came to prepare medicine for you. It will help.

153
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,250
Thanks.

154
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,620
I don't know how long it's been

155
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,380
since I last slept as deeply as I did last night.

156
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,480
That's great.

157
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,720
So you should sleep too.

158
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,740
I will go after I see you fall asleep.

159
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,450
Aigoo, aigoo. I'm dying.

160
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,330
Aigoo, I'm dying. There's no part of me that doesn't hurt.

161
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,130
From what? You're embarrassing as a man.

162
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:18,110
If you say something about dying again, just know that you'll die by my hands.
 (Lee Ji Ran) 

163
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,650
No, it's okay.

164
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,890
You're suffered so much. How are you feeling?
 (Lee Seong Gye) 

165
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,920
I'm sorry, Hyung-nim.

166
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,710
Those bastards flocked toward me so I couldn't even fight properly.

167
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,300
Who would have known that such a thing would happen?

168
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,780
Traps were completely placed everywhere.

169
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:53,280
We were also totally surprised when we heard about the assassin jumping out among the corpses.

170
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,200
I have been wanting to talk to you about that assassin anyway.

171
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,220
Yes. About that assassin.

172
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,180
I was also thinking about that assassin who killed himself.

173
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,640
What about that assassin?

174
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,340
There are only two possibilities for why he committed suicide.

175
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,880
It's either to hide his identity or to hide the one who is behind him.

176
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,350
But in a situation where Jo Min Soo has already been revealed as the mastermind, he killed himself.

177
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,770
Doesn't that mean that he's trying to hide his identity instead of hiding the one who was behind him?

178
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,830
If it was like that, then there's someone we don't know

179
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,910
who's targeting you, General.

180
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,950
Are you also here to talk about that?

181
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,810
Yes. Also, I think I've seen that face somewhere.

182
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,090
Should I look into it?

183
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,850
Right. We have to deal with the aftermath of this case so go and investigate that person.

184
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,350
Yes. I will do so.

185
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,540
I know that you are worried.

186
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,300
That's right. If this becomes a huge issue,

187
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,530
the whole country will know about the war between Jo Min Soo and I.

188
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,890
Yes. If he gets stained with the assassination plot,

189
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,710
you'd have to investigate all of the noble families involved.

190
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,850
If that happens, political opinion will be disrupted for a while.

191
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,010
So, do you have a  good idea?

192
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,430
The one who would be the most anxious after such a thing happened is Brother Po Eun.

193
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,350
How about making a request to Brother Po Eun?

194
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,470
What do you mean by request?

195
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,420
What?

196
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,950
Among my servants, there is one who is a personal enemy to Lee Bang Ji?

197
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,730
That's right.

198
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:09,640
So because of a mere coincidence like that, all of this happened?

199
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,420
How is that a mere coincidence?

200
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,940
You made so many people suffer,

201
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,540
and among everyone one of those people was in that place.

202
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,740
It was inevitable.

203
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,120
How can we fail because of such an outrageous thing?

204
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,840
What about the assassin? That assassin that jumped out among the corpses?

205
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,180
Who is that person?

206
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,990
I also don't know him.

207
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,670
Does it make sense for you to not know an assassin who is in Do Hwa Jeon?

208
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:50,130
What is there for me to avoid now that I would lie to you?

209
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,860
It seems that you don't know either.

210
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,840
Right. Since there are other people besides me who want to take Lee Seong Gye's life,

211
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,900
I won't be so lonely after all.

212
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,370
Why would Jo Min Soo have made such an extreme choice?

213
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:29,950
Also, why would such people waver before a prophecy like that?
 (The Lee Family will be King) 

214
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,730
The General's power that is growing stronger by the day,
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

215
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,790
and is pushing radical reform, must have scared those people.

216
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,660
If Jo Min Soo gets charged with the crime of revolting, everyone will be anxious.

217
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:52,550
If that happens, Teacher Mok Eun and the other Sadaebu with him might think differently.

218
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,360
We must not make everyone our enemies, General.

219
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,190
You're right, Brother. If we want the reformation process we're doing to go smoothly,

220
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,280
Teacher Lee Saek must help us.

221
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:12,080
What about making Teacher Lee Saek the prime minister?

222
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:20,410
You know why we are so desperately wanting reform, Brother Po Eun.

223
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,970
You are also right about it not working if we turn everyone into our enemies.

224
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,870
So?

225
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,760
So please persuade them, Brother.

226
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,630
Nothing will happen if you just go against Teacher Mok Eun behind the scenes.

227
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:43,160
If he will not accept the Prime Minister position right away, then please arrange for us to meet and discuss with him.

228
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,770
We will tell him about the things that we are trying to do and we will listen to what he wants to do.

229
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,490
Please let us compromise.

230
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,850
Prime Minister?

231
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,840
Everyone knows that Minister Lee Seong Gye has a hold over all of the power,
 (Woo Hak Joo) 

232
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,390
so are they telling Teacher to be a scarecrow for them?

233
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,290
How can you think of it as being a scarecrow?

234
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,820
Isn't that what you're saying?

235
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,730
Look here!

236
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,840
The Do Dang is now under Lee Seong Gye's feet.

237
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,470
What do they mean by giving Teacher a Prime Minister position that is only a facade?

238
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,250
Don't you know that this is just a political strategy?

239
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,910
If we think that it is just a political strategy, then it will be like that.

240
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,900
If we think of it the other way around, then the result will be different.

241
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,800
Brother.

242
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,380
Teacher, whatever crisis the Sadaebu face, whatever situation it may be,

243
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,040
you taught us that we must stand up at the Do Dang to take responsibility and do everything with sincerity.

244
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,730
Would words come across to them?
 (Lee Saek) 

245
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,880
We have to talk to them for words to come across.

246
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:59,130
All of Sam Bong's and my thoughts came from you, Teacher.

247
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,360
On the soil that you cultivated, Sam Bong's and my reformation plans sprouted.

248
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,040
The reform that Sam Bong and I are thinking of might be different from what you have in mind, Teacher,

249
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,850
but it's probably not much of a difference.

250
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,040
What are you going to do?

251
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,060
Teacher, what reason do you have to cooperate with Lee Seong Gye?

252
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,710
Arrange a place for us to negotiate.

253
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,320
Like you said, I will be sincere with negotiations.

254
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,530
Yes, I will do so. You made the right choice, Teacher.

255
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,170
 Is the land reform really too much? Or... 

256
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,400
Is anyone out there?

257
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,460
Go to General Lee Seong Gye's house and Lord Mok Eun's house and

258
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,980
give them the message that I wish to meet them at jinshi (7am-9am) tomorrow at Do Dang, and come back with their reply.

259
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,500
Yes.

260
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,280
I heard that you will have a meeting with General Lee Seong Gye tomorrow at the hour of Jin.

261
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,670
That's how it happened.

262
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,960
Are you going to accept the minister post?

263
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,600
If they listen to my demands, and if their demands for my taking the prime minister position are reasonable.

264
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,400
What kind of demand are you going to make?

265
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,970
Yes, in what way are you planning to take the upper hand during the negotiation meeting tomorrow?

266
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,700
I am also curious. It will probably be about the land reform, right?
 (Han Gu Young) 

267
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,570
They will probably come out with a reform bill that will confiscate lands that are over ten-million square meters.

268
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,190
In my opinion, I think negotiating with at least 20-million square meters...

269
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:47,190
I'm not saying it because I have about 18-million square meters of land...

270
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,940
In tomorrow's meeting, how about telling them that lands over five-million square meters will be confiscated

271
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,620
and that we will not agree to less (more than five-million) than that?

272
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,890
No. It's a meeting that unexpectedly came to allow us to gain profit from Jo Min Soo's revolt.

273
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,260
We have to make demands according to the original bill that we passed.

274
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,240
That is right but I can't help but be worried.

275
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,000
Jo Min Soo plotted that uproar even with ten-million square meters. Do you think it will get approved by lowering it to five million?

276
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,290
General Nam Eun. We have to push it.

277
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,560
What do you think will Teacher Mok Eun demand?

278
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,350
Wouldn't the land reform be the topic of tomorrow's meeting?

279
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,920
I have a few things I'm expecting.

280
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,020
If his demand is among those that I'm thinking of,

281
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,200
we can easily gain more from it.

282
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,880
Although it can also turn out like what you said.

283
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,210
What happened?

284
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,310
Like you expected, I don't think Jo Min Soo is behind that man.

285
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:56,400
As expected... Who could it be? It's not Ha Ryun.

286
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,160
Please put me in charge of it. I will find it out no matter what.

287
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,680
The fact that there is someone out there that we don't know of is very dangerous for us. Find it out no matter what.

288
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,330
Yes. I understand.

289
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,090
More than that, I heard that you got a meeting through Teacher Po Eun.

290
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,780
Is it a negotiation?

291
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,250
It seems that you have complaints.

292
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,800
We keep on beating around the bush.

293
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,220
Jo Min Soo gave us a good opportunity. We can achieve it by using power.

294
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,000
Of course, we can. It will happen if we psuh through it with force.

295
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,930
But why?

296
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:40,020
I am not doing a revolution that kills people,

297
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:45,770
but I made a plan based on my Confucian belief of saving people.

298
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,360
Of course, it has to go through much trial and error.

299
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,100
There are things that we cannot estimate or count.

300
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,760
Even if we say that it would be good to spill less blood, blood will be spilled more than we expect.

301
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,280
So this negotiation becomes more important

302
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,960
because it mean something else to me.

303
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,400
Meaning?

304
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,180
Po Eun. It's so that I don't lose Po Eun.

305
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,890
In the end of this road to revolution, Brother Po Eun

306
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:28,780
only protects my Confucian belief. He is the one who will justify our revolution.

307
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,410
Today's meeting is for us to get rid of resentment and misunderstanding,

308
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:47,900
discuss together, negotiate, and make a better country.

309
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Please speak while keeping an open mind.

310
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:59,100
Since you already mentioned it, I only want one thing to dispel my misunderstanding.

311
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:06,120
Yes. I came here to listen to your opinions. Please speak.

312
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:15,980
Bring the previous king back to Gaegyeong.
 (Previous King: King Woo)

314
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,760
Yes, do that. We will do that.

315
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,700
We will also speak up.

316
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,030
Yes, what our side wants is

317
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,970
an immediate and full-scale enforcement

318
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,130
of the land reform raised by Jo Joon.

319
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,050
It's not a revised plan of confiscating lands over ten-million square meters.

320
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,360
If there's even one square meter of expropriated land, it will be confiscated.

321
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,020
Enforcing the original bill. Are you going to agree?

322
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,060
But that is...

323
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,340
I ask to pause the meeting for a bit.

324
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,720
Yes, of course. Have a discussion and come back.

325
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,420
To think that they would agree to bring back the previous king to Gaegyeong.

326
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,840
Full-scale enforcement of the land reform must not happen.

327
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,970
Even with a standard of ten-million square meters, everyone was in a panic

328
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,370
so it must not happen.

329
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,710
What are you going to do, Teacher?

330
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,090
Let's comply to it. Full-scale enforcement.

331
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,720
What?

332
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,090
After the previous king comes back, we can just change the situation.

333
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,420
Bring the previous king back?

334
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,280
It was one of the things that Sam Bong already expected to come up.

335
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,040
Yes. Fortunately, he came up with the best one.

336
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,460
What do you mean fortunately? His Majesty is not yet old enough.

337
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,820
but if the previous king comes back to Gaegyeong, it would be no different than putting him back on the throne.

338
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,960
Of course, it won't do if he comes back to Gaegyeong.

339
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,740
So?

340
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,150
Just wait.

341
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,820
Teacher Mok Eun will make a proposition that we will want.

342
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:01,030
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

343
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,440
Then, let's continue the discussion.

344
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,090
Are you really agreeing to the previous king's return to the palace?

345
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,530
Yes.

346
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:31,090
Only if you agree to the full-scale enforcement of our original reform bill.

347
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,910
What is your decision?

348
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,020
I will do so.

349
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,520
Yes. Then should we decide on the date of the previous king's return to the palace?

350
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,100
On one condition.

351
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,760
Please tell us.

352
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,160
The land research that Woo Jae prepared is a great and massive documentation,

353
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,820
but how can we carry out such important task

354
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,460
without the country's official survey of the lands?

355
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,440
So, after performing a large-scale and official survey of the lands,

356
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,580
carry out the land reform based on those results.

357
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,460
It can't be any more accurate than my data.

358
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,660
Do you even know how long it takes to perform a lan survey?

359
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,620
It will take at least five years.

360
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,900
Woo Jae has no right to speak here.

361
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,760
We will remove you if you do not quietly watch.

362
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,880
Please continue.

363
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,340
What are you going to do?

364
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,590
Yes, fine. Let's do a survey of the lands.

365
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,580
Then we will bring the previous king in Kanghwa Island only to Yeojoo (instead of all the way to Gaegyeong).

366
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,130
Look here, Sam Bong!

367
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,380
We can just set the palace return date to the day the land reform is enforced

368
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,900
after the survey of the lands is finished?

369
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,560
Okay. Let's do that.

370
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,460
Yes, so with this, the land reform has been passed,

371
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,640
the land survey will be started immediately,

372
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,580
and the previous king will be escorted from Kanghwa Island to Yeojoo.

373
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,100
Also, Teacher Mok Eun will take the prime minister position,

374
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:30,080
and Genereal Lee will take the position of vice prime minister to manage the state affairs. How is that?

375
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,420
If you both agree, I will petition His Majesty and receive His royal decree.

376
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,620
I agree. Let us do that.

377
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,560
Also, regarding Jo Min Soo,

378
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,660
if General Lee Seong Gye agrees,

379
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,020
what do you think of treating it as an impeachment due to illegal land expropriation instead of political upheaval?

380
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,160
Fine. Let's do that.

381
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,600
I think it went well.

382
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,740
They will think the land reform bill has been passed, but since it will take at least five years to survey the lands...

383
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:16,020
And since we brought the previous king to Yeojoo, aren't we able to gather up power?

384
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,460
Yes, and now that Teacher Mok Eun has been made prime minister and we've bought some time with the land survey,

385
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,900
- we will have to take control of the government within that time. 
 - Of course.

386
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,980
We will also have to unite and make sure we don't split up.

387
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,290
 Lee Saek 

388
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,890
You are all saying the right things.

389
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,050
But...

390
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:45,940
 Sam Bong... What did that smile mean? Did you want this to happpen? 

391
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:51,170
I have done as you asked, but is there a reason to delay our work by surveying the lands?

392
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:55,350
They will think that they bought some time by performing the land survey.

393
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:01,830
So they will think to overthrow this reform within the five years.

394
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,580
But if we use Woo Jae's data as the background to the land survey,

395
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,680
we can finish it within two years.

396
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,420
When the time comes, we will push it forward without giving them a chance.

397
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,590
Is it okay to move the previous king to Yeojoo?

398
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:22,170
As long as he doesn't return to the palace in Gaegyeong, it doesn't matter whether he's in Kanghwa Island or Yeojoo.

399
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:28,090
So we can just prepare for our next move.

400
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,210
Sam Bong.

401
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,100
Colleague.

402
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,770
Do you want to get some afternoon drinks with me?

403
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,470
- Thanks for the meal. 
 - Come again.

404
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,310
You have done well as the mediator.

405
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,910
Thanks to you, I think things went well.

406
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,810
I just did what was necessary.

407
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,600
Now you have to act as the person that balances power.

408
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,280
They think that the land survey will take about five years,

409
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,680
but if we use Jo Joon's data as the basis,

410
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,140
it will be done in two years.

411
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,000
And through the full-scale land reform—

412
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,900
Why are you in such a hurry?

413
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,370
It's something that nobody has been able to do during the past 500 years.

414
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,230
Doing it quickly is not the important thing,

415
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:23,680
but doing it correctly slowly and surely with the public opinion and without any sacrifice.

416
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,830
If it's sacrifice... It will probably be the Gwon Moon Sae Jok's sacrifice.

417
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:31,790
Is your goal the land reform or getting rid of the Gwon Moon Sae Jok?

418
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,250
- Colleague. 
 - And what's after that?

419
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,560
After getting rid of the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

420
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,530
Regarding General Lee Seong Gye,

421
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,830
there is a terrible rumor going around.

422
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:49,040
Do you perhaps have ulterior motives?

423
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,040
How can Genera Lee Seong Gye have ulterior motives?

424
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,700
No... Not Genera Lee Seong Gye, but you.

425
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,400
Do you have ulterior motives?

426
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,700
What kind of ulterior motives are you talking about?

427
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,400
It's nothing. How could you have ulterior motives?

428
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,820
You two.

429
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,900
I think I've seen that person before.

430
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,320
- Who? 
 - That guy.

431
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,540
The guy that tried to kill father. I think I've seen him before.

432
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,580
- Where? 
 - You know that day when we went to get Teacher Jo Joon's data?

433
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,390
Do you remember that guy who was there before us and stole the documents?

434
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,470
But I can't remember clearly. You guys saw him too, right?

435
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,960
Yeah.

436
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,780
I think I can remember.

437
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,600
Let's confirm it.

438
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,290
What? Is that really true?

439
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,200
We have to see his face.

440
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,150
His corpse is still here, right?

441
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,910
I heard that corpses without any family connections are cremated at Bohyun Temple.

442
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,490
Did you take the corpses?

443
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,410
It's about time for them to be taken, but I'm not sure.

444
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,830
Take these guys with you and quickly show them the face of the corpse.

445
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,130
It's this guy.

446
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,120
I think it is him.

447
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,850
You?

448
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,000
 What is it? 

449
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,340
Yes! It's him. I'm sure of it.

450
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,130
Then really?

451
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:07,770
 That night, it was Ha Ryun that was trying to take the documents. 

452
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:12,840
 Then it was Ha Ryun that tried to kill father? 

453
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,860
 But why? 

454
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
There is someone that I have in mind. Let's go.

455
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,750
Those people... I don't think they are monks.

456
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,610
What?

457
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,880
There were wearing leather shoes.

458
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,940
Isn't that forbidden by law?

459
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,520
Nah, nowadays there are so many monks with leather shoes and silk robes.

460
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,230
- But it's Bohyun Temple. 
 - What?

461
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,030
Bo Hyeon Temple is different from those other temples.

462
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:16,150
Furthermore, looking at their faces, they seem to be too young to be doing such things.

463
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,140
At that age, whether it's Biguk Temple or Bo Hyeon Temple, there is no way that they'd go around wearing leather shoes.

464
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:32,110
That person has said he will leave it to luck.

465
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,750
There has been luck brought from the heavens on Lee Seong Gye.

466
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:42,110
So? Even so, those people will be in the way of his plans.

467
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,030
Is he choosing Lee Seong Gye?

468
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,070
Why are you trying to decipher his plans?

469
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:09,830
It was right. This is not the way to Bo Hyeon Temple. How did you know?

470
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,520
I'm rather sensitive to shoes.

471
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,360
Elder! Elder!

472
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,990
Why? Is it someone you know?

473
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,580
That person, at that time...

474
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,830
Did Ha Ryun really want to kill Father?

475
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,320
Open it.

476
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,510
How can this be?

477
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,540
Why are you like that?

478
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,780
Was it really this man?

479
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,610
Yes. Is anything wrong?

480
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,480
 Why was he surprised? 

481
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,000
 If he ordered the man, there's no way he'd be surprised. 

482
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,450
Ho Jeong!

483
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,320
W-What?

484
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,450
You!

485
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,520
Lee Bang Won!

486
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,510
How dare you plot the assassination General Lee Seong Gye?

487
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,970
What are you saying? It's not me.

488
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,350
Moo Hyul.

489
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,100
Yes.

490
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,350
Just deliver this accordingly.

491
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,670
I didn't order him to.

492
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,210
What assassination plot? It's true.

493
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,530
Then why did you take this corpse?

494
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,950
I have something to check.

495
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,290
Ah, you're lying!

496
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,380
What?

497
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:38,180
No. He was really surprised when he looked at the corpse.

498
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,320
She saw it correctly. I was shocked when I saw his face.

499
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,250
A montage... What about this?

500
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,550
I have been chasing this man for the past fourteen years.
 (Ha Ryun) 

501
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,790
Fourteen years?

502
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,270
Lee In Gyeom was chasing after him.

503
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:23,150
There was an organization that placed Hap Ha in that position.

504
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,200
Organization?

505
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,520
At a critical moment, they gave Hap Ha critical information and helped him.

506
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,850
I only chased this man according to Hap Ha's orders.

507
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,030
How can I believe that?

508
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,600
It's true! That organization has a unique pattern.

509
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,870
To check whether this man is a part of that organization,

510
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,300
I was searching his body.

511
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:53,290
He definitely has a mark. You can go ahead and check.

512
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,840
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

513
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,170
See! It's there, right?

514
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,110
 You bastard! This is the letter you were going to send the mole. 

515
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:34,520
 This was sent by Lee In Gyeom, right? 

516
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,430
This is the mark on that spy who infiltrated Ham Joo.

517
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,090
So that spy wasn't sent by Lee In Gyeom?

518
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,900
What do you mean? Hap Ha had a

519
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,080
hard time because of that organization.

520
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,450
 Did you plant a spy at Ham Joo to acquire this? 

521
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:05,330
 I didn't plant a spy in Ham Joo. 

522
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,280
 This drawing in this letter! The one who has this mark took our mother! 

523
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,530
It was that mark from back then.

524
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,720
What?

525
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,540
When we were young, you said that at the Beggar Village. That organization that kidnapped your mother. Do you remember?

526
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,650
Ah, is that so? Was it the mark from that time?

527
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,310
We have to catch them no matter what. We have to tell Teacher Sam Bong and the General.

528
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,500
We have to catch them. That damn organization or something.

529
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,320
Do you know where Teacher Sam Bong is? He wasn't home.

530
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,460
Today, Teacher Sam Bong... Dongsaeng, did you not see him?

531
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,310
He went to bring porridge to Bang Ji earlier.

532
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,030
Aigoo. He's very nice.

533
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,540
Let's hurry and go.

534
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:10,350
I'm quite tired so I will go in and rest.

535
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,920
It's because I'm tired, Young Master.

536
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,570
Okay. Have a rest.

537
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,080
Teacher, I found it.

538
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,510
What is this?

539
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:52,570
This was tattooed on the body of the man who tried to kill Father.

540
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,710
Mom...

541
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,970
Lee In Gyeom?

542
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,520
Yes. Lee In Gyeom has also been following that man for fourteen years.

543
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,090
He wasn't able to find him in the end but Teacher Ho Jeong did.

544
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,030
Ddang Sae, what's wrong?

545
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,310
What are you? Why do you have it on your sword?

546
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:59,130
A long time ago, a certain organization kidnapped my mother.

547
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,260
Until now, I still don't know about

548
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,320
my mother's whereabouts and the identity of that organization.

549
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:16,390
This is the mark of that organization. I carved it in my sword so that I will not forget.

550
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,370
What about Gil Seon Mi?

551
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:24,630
Right. Gil Seon Mi was with that man.

552
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,980
I still don't know about that.

553
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,090
Is he on the same side or not.

554
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,950
A long time ago, I met Gil Seon Mi.

555
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,930
This is what he told me, "Your mother killed Princess Noguk.

556
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,470
She's a Goryeo criminal so don't look for her."

557
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,370
Just what is this?

558
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,740
The one behind Lee In Gyeom who used to hold the greatest power,

559
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,110
the one who knew about Jo Min Soo's plot that even we weren't aware of beforehand,

560
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:06,490
has deployed an assassin. Just what kind of organization is this?

561
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,270
Nameless.

562
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,150
Nameless?

563
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,820
Do you know about that organization?

564
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,090
I didn't believe it for a long time.

565
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,020
In 1365, after Princess Noguk passed away in the end,

566
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:33,070
King Gong Min said that it was not an accident

567
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,760
but an organization called Nameless was behind it.

568
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,010
So?

569
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:43,250
At the time, King Gong Min wasn't in the right mind. Everyone thought he was just delusional.

570
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,400
And then while saying he would catch the Nameless,

571
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,280
he tortured the court ladies. And in that process,

572
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,720
Yeon Hyang killed herself.

573
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,480
If you mother is really Yeon Hyang,

574
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,700
then she didn't actually kill herself back then, but escaped out of the palace.

575
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,820
Nameless... Why are you going after us?

576
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:41,690
 We have to find out. The Nameless... What they are and what they want. 

577
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,820
 Why they tried to take Jo Joon's data. All of it. 

578
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,720
Bon Won, I will meet with Cho Young.

579
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,640
I will find out if she knows anything of that symbol.

580
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,260
Please do that. I'll leave that to you.

581
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,750
It's late. Why are you here?

582
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,330
There something urgent that I have to report to you.

583
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,270
Tell me.

584
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,840
By any chance...

585
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,140
Do you know anything about this symbol?

586
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,720
Well... 
 (Cho Young, Hwa Sa Dan's owner) 

587
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,400
I don't think I've ever seen this symbol before. What is it?

588
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,680
At Geneal Lee Seong Gye's Ga Byeol Cho today...

589
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,710
Unni! You were here.

590
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:39,370
Pal Bong Ajusshi brought this, saying it might be urgent.

591
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,710
When did this arrive?

592
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,890
A few moments ago...

593
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,320
Why are you so late?

594
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,720
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

595
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,900
Teacher Jo Joon has sent this letter in urgency. 
 (Min Da Kyung, later Queen Won Kyung) 

596
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,720
Here...

597
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,180
I think it's urgent.

598
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:14,920
 The place with our research data is in danger. Please come quickly. - Jo Joon 

599
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,520
Moo Hyul. We should go quickly.

600
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,080
Yes.

601
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,040
Who brought this?

602
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,780
I think it might Teacher Jo Joon's servant.

603
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,310
But I've never seen him before.

604
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,960
Father hasn't come back yet... So shouldn't you hurry and go? 
 (Lee Bang Woo) 

605
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,420
- There something wrong with this... 
 - What?

606
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,090
This is definitely Woo Jae's handwriting,

607
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,230
but we have a special code for referring to the place we store our documents and data.

608
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,460
Then why?

609
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:49,890
Then it could be a trap.

610
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,670
Why are you here?

611
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,870
Did you send this?

612
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,400
 Jo Joon 

613
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,130
What in the world is this?

614
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,220
Then you didn't send it?

615
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,270
So it was a trap...

616
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:27,330
Isn't this my handwriting? How can it be so similar?

617
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,920
If I had gone to that place after I received this letter,

618
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,790
they were probably trying to follow me to find out the location.

619
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,500
Just what kind of man would?

620
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,770
You might not be the only person who received this.

621
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:42,850
Of course. Whoever also received this letter will have moved towards the place.

622
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,320
And whoever planned this will be following them.

623
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,040
Something might have happened already.

624
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,810
I must go there right away.

625
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,320
Did nothing happen? Is everything alright?

626
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,180
Did you come here after receiving this letter?

627
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,180
- Did you receive it too? 
 - Yes.

628
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,740
But the documents are still there.

629
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,760
And Teacher Jo Joon isn't here.

630
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,420
 A trap... 

631
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,630
Something's wrong.

632
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,350
Teacher!

633
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,440
Woo Jae didn't write this letter. It has been forged.

634
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,840
Then did they lure us here to find out the location of our data?

635
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,630
Since the data is all here, if we move it quickly--

636
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,550
Perhaps,

637
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,170
someone is coming here now

638
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,480
to steal this data?

639
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,880
- Moo Hyul.
- Yes.

640
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,540
Young Master.

641
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:44,590
Now we have discovered the location.

642
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,030
So are you going to steal Jo Joon's data?

643
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,230
Now the problem isn't just that data,

644
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,800
since the Do Dang has decided to do a land survey.

645
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,080
- Then?
- It's a counter-attack.

646
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,480
The most fatal counter-attack.

647
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,240
Who did you send?

648
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,720
The most fatal person will go there.

649
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,960
It's his will.

650
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:17,900
On this night, what is going to happen?

651
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,080
You guys, what are you doing here?

652
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,160
Teacher Po Eun, how are you here?

653
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,140
I received a weird letter, so I came here...

654
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,040
Colleague!

655
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:45,690
New Joseon?

656
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,750
What is this?

657
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:12,940

 General, please don't make Sam Bong into a traitor. 

660
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,570
 What I am saying is, don't be a usurper. 

661
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:28,720
 Sam Bong said that you, Teacher Po Eun, are the most important person in the new country we are going to make. 

662
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,170
 The official from the Ministry of Taxation, Kim Song Ak, 

663
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,560
 who was leaving today to survey the lands, has been murdered. 

664
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,850
 The Nameless... I think it's the Nameless. 

665
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:37,710
 They actually existed? 

666
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,600
 Jeon Do Jeong is secretly moving his people. Should I send the kids? 

667
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,860
 I will go myself. 

668
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,900
 I must find them no matter what.
