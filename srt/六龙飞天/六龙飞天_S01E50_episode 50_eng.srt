3
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,920
 Moo Hyul! 

4
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,680
 Warrior-nim! 

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,880
 Can we get out of here alive? 

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,640
 Warrior Moo Hyul! Without any mistakes, I will follow your order!
  

7
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,860
Your Highness, go!

8
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,780
I understand.

9
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,400
Let's go.

10
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,340
 He's totally different from before. 

11
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:44,180
Your name is Moo Hyul, right? That was surprising for such a short time.

12
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,660
But still, it will be difficult fighting me.

13
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,880
You and I have the same basics. I can read all of your moves.

14
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,240
It's not just you

15
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,620
who knows about me.

16
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,360
Mother, go and escape!

17
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,360
Ddang Sae!

18
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,720
Mugeuk!

19
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,080
 She knows he is her son? 

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
 But why did she pretend that she didn't know? 

21
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,720
 She's changed. 

22
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,360
 She doesn't get flustered and there's no hesitation. 

23
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,280
 He's not being careful of his life at all. 

24
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,580
 Gil Seon Mi. You're not an opponent that I can't overcome anymore. 

25
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,780
I'll be a proper opponent from here on. It will be a bit different.

26
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,700
I will also be a bit different.

27
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,640
They say I get stronger when I'm protecting someone.

28
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,820
Lee Bang Won!

29
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,720
Your Highness!

30
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,520
Your Highness! Are you okay?

31
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,220
You ran away so fast... so I'm not okay.

32
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,180
What do you mean escape? To protect Your Highness,

33
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,220
I risked my life and gathered the troops and...

34
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,560
Anyway, let's make haste.

35
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,280
What are you all doing? Guard His Highness!

36
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,420
Yes!

37
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,500
 Brother... Mother... What should I do? 

38
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,020
Your sword no longer knows any hesitation.

39
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,860
Because I couldn't protect anyone.

40
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,140
I was the same.

41
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,420
In the end, a battle is about experience.

42
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,960
Master Hong is really unfortunate.

43
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,240
He'll have to go to one of his students' funeral today.

44
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,040
Mugeuk, what did you say?

45
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,360
I knew about it, Yook San!

46
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,540
Mugeuk! It's not that.

47
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,280
Gil Seon Mi did it. He did it by himself.

48
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,480
Yook San, go back and wait.

49
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,600
 Hyung! Young Gyu Hyung! 

50
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,480
 Hyungnim! 

51
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,680
 Cheok Sa Gwang. 

52
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,100
Monk Gil!

53
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,160
I think I'm done for.

54
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,620
No. Let's get off of the mountain. Hurry.

55
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,480
It was because of resentment.

56
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:39,040
My resentment to you who left and abandoned me. I'm sorry.

57
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:47,160
For lying to you that your children were dead, I'm sorry.

58
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,060
I don't think I can protect you until the end.

59
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,200
No. Don't.

60
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,220
Monk Gil! No.

61
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,820
Monk Gil! Monk Gil!

62
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,920
Monk Gil!

63
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,820
Foolish thing.

64
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:56,760
If I hadn't done it back then, we would've all died anyway.

65
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,120
You would've been gone too.

66
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,480
If I hadn't suggested we do that back then,

67
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,680
if we had lost the faction battle,

68
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,980
do you, who ran away, think they would have just left your family be?

69
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,340
In any case,

70
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:39,160
whichever side it was, the outcome for your family

71
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,480
was the same.

72
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Young Gyu Hyung.

73
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,700
Why did you kill him?

74
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,240
The armory in Banchon.

75
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,100
Why was it made?

76
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,460
To raise a rebellion.

77
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,190
They probably made it to kill Teacher Sam Bong.

78
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,090
That's right. It's probably the great cause to you people.

79
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,240
You killed Po Eun and His Highness. It is in this newly established country,

80
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,670
where it's not even enough to kill each other off,

81
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,130
that you caused a child to die.

82
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,030
 Then, in that armory... The child... 

83
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,760
So...

84
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,540
Who are you going to kill?

85
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,600
Five sinners.

86
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,240
Nameless who forced Our Highness to the throne,

87
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,240
the ones who killed His Highness and the Wang clan,

88
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,520
Lee Seong Gye and Jeong Do Jeon,

89
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,520
and the owner of the armory in Banchon,

90
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Lee Bang Won!

91
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,690
Even with strong swordsmanship,

92
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,040
in the end,

93
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,670
a sinner who couldn't protect

94
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,780
anyone.

95
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,850
So you

96
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,260
are the last sinner.

97
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,850
 It's not because of you. It's not even your fault. 

98
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,440
 It's just that the world is strange. 

99
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,140
It's not your fault.

100
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,730
It's the world that is strange.

101
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,580
The world is strange.

102
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,270
That's comforting.

103
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,580
Thank you

104
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,800
for killing me.

105
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,670
 Thank you for saving me. 

106
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,140
You

107
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,130
saved me.

108
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,050
Now,

109
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,620
is it our turn?

110
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,470
Become even stronger

111
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,370
and come to kill me, Moo Hyul.

112
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,240
Please.

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

114
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,100
 If you meet Bang Ji, please tell him 

115
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,810
 not to fight for me 

116
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,140
 nor to lightly throw his life away for me. 

117
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,290
You're safe.

118
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,550
Won't you come with me

119
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,010
just until Namgyeong (Nanjing)?

120
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,940
Don't you have Monk Gil?

121
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,050
He died.

122
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,940
What are you going to do?

123
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,720
After that, do what you want to do.

124
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,840
Do that.

125
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,200
Do as Mom says.

126
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,080
No.

127
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,920
Do as I say.

128
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,360
Boon.

129
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,410
In any case, Brother,

130
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,610
you can't live here anymore.

131
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,360
Since we survived,

132
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,890
let's live the next stage of life, Brother.

133
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,160
What about you?

134
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,930
I will leave for a faraway island.

135
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,290
I have people to take care of and protect.

136
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,640
A person to take care of

137
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,540
and protect.

138
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,560
Brother.

139
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,740
That's great,

140
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,740
Boon Yi.

141
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,990
What?

142
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,690
We brought the corpses of Yook San, Head of Nameless,

143
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,450
and Gil Seon Mi to the yard.

144
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,220
Why?

145
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,080
Aren't you supposed to chase after the remaining Nameless members?

146
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,500
I can be a big help.

147
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,570
What a crazy person.

148
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,130
How dare you speak of such a scheme to me? Someone!

149
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,720
You!

150
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,240
Back in the days,

151
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,540
in the Songak branch, after killing his superior and his subordinates,

152
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,260
there was a member who escaped riding a horse.

153
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,470
Since we are an organization that's scattered everywhere, the one can always hide his identity by killing the two.

154
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,430
- What are you saying?
- During the faction battle

155
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,030
since the Songak branch's member list disspeared, everything probably went perfectly for you.

156
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,270
Now that you are pushed into a corner

157
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,890
I guess you are delusional.

158
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,360
If you really want to cooperate,

159
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,630
you can watch my back, right?

160
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,210
What do you want?

161
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,970
Since even private trading will be banned,

162
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,350
I'm thinking of becoming a merchant.

163
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,290
Merchant? You mean a peddler?

164
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,560
A great alliance with Joseon merchants.

165
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,240
Will you help me?

166
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,630
Only if we both profit...

167
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,410
Then, you won't be able to use the name Jeok Ryeong anymore.

168
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,800
Yes. Most likely.

169
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,370
From now on,

170
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,530
what should I call you?

171
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,720
My real name that I was called, back in my home,

172
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,770
is Baek Dal Won.

173
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,940
I'm Baek Dal Won.
 (Baek Dal Won: Father/originator of Joseon peddler group) 

174
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,850
What happened?

175
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,940
 Stay alive and wait for an order. 

176
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,870
 I will follow your order, Mugeuk. 

177
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,200
- What is it?
- Lady Boon Yi asked me to deliver it.

178
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,110
Saying that it will be hard to see you, she left it with me.

179
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,130
Go.

180
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,800
What you said about no people smiling,

181
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,510
I will keep it in mind.

182
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,980
- You waited for a long time, right?
- Did you say goodbye?

183
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,290
- Yes.
- Still, we're able to say goodbye before we go.

184
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,740
- I feel refreshed.
- That's right.

185
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,430
We said our goodbyes earlier.

186
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:34,370
Still, let's all go together and say goodbye.

187
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,340
Your Highness, please be healthy.

188
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,180
I hope everything goes well.

189
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,210
 Your Highness 

190
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,810
 The promise you made when you gave me the clothing tie... 

191
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,710
 about the land and 

192
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,120
 the people's dreams. 

193
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,050
 Please don't forget that. 

194
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,680
 That's how you won't become the bug. 

195
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,110
 That's how Boon Yi 

196
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,370
 will be able to smile somewhere. 

197
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,260
 Please be healthy. 

198

199
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,420
 Two years later 
Tell me properly.

200
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,500
Are you going to kill me or not?

201
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:11,390
With only 60 soldiers

202
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,850
you tried to conspire against me?

203
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,120
Bang Won, I'll just say one thing to you.

204
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,840
Listen well.

205
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,310
Please save me!

206
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,010
Make sure

207
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,330
to save me!

208
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,540
Yes, Hyungnim.

209
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,350
What you said right now,

210
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,660
and your tone,

211
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,000
- is that right?
- Then what should I do?

212
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,210
I have my pride as a Hamjoo man!

213
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,210
Bang Gan, this ignorant fool.

214
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,350
A fool like him thinking of starting a rebellion!

215
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,950
Still, Prince Jeong An

216
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,510
allowing his brother to live,

217
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,480
isn't it a good thing?

218
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:15,020
In this turbulent time, to save the life of a brother who attacked you,

219
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,920
will become an example.

220
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,000
You're being too generous, Your Highness.

221
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,600
Prince Jeong An. No. Bang Won.

222
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,410
Yes, Your Highness.

223
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,000
Please let me rest now.

224
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,700
I will abdicate the throne now.

225
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,070
 Three years since the previous king ascended to the throne, 

226
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,450
 having contributed in establishing the country, 

227
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,730
 having relations in political affairs, 

228
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,890
 the throne will be passed to Prince Jeong An. 

229
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,720
 Respect everyone and be benevolent 

230
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,770
 and be diligent towards the people. 

231
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,620
 A bright world! 

232
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,480
 A bright world! 

233
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,720
 Joseon's third king
King Taejong Lee Bang Won 

234
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,920
 Min Moo Gu, Min Moo Jil. 

235
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,320
 Tell them to kill themselves. 

236
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,220
How can you do this?

237
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,470
Are you planning to kill the whole Min family?

238
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,030
I am also from the Min family! Kill me too!

239
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,650
All of you, leave!

240
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,820
Who was it who hid weapons in Banchon?

241
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,660
Who funded you to raise a private army?

242
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,580
If it were not for our Min family,

243
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,540
would you be sitting in that spot right now?

244
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,780
Queen...

245
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,910
Am I wrong?

246
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,120
They said that for (the benefit of) the crown prince, Hyo Ryeong and Chung Nyeong must be eliminated.
 (Hyo Ryeong: Lee Bang Won's 2nd son, Lee Bo) 

247
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,110
Hyo Ryeong (Lee Bo) and Chung Nyeong (Lee Do).
 (Chung Nyeong: Lee Bang Won's 3rd son, Lee Do.) 

248
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,480
Aren't they your children?

249
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,980
It's not for that reason, is it?

250
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,210
Didn't you do it because

251
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,020
you want it all for yourself?

252
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,390
Do you think

253
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,210
that I don't know Your Highness?

254
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,920
If you know,

255
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,550
then you should be more careful, Queen.

256
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,920
Are you playing with that toy again?

257
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,340
Why are you reading this many books?

258
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,400
It's just... It's fun.

259
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,480
Fun?

260
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:20,830
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

261
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,400
Do you want to be the crown prince?

262
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,160
Do you want to practice politics?

263
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,760
It's not...

264
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,200
What is politics?

265
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,240
I'm asking you what politics is.

266
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,820
Confucius said...

267
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm asking about what  you  think.

268
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:56,260
As expected, there's no way you'd know something like that.
 (Taejong Lee Bang Won: Joseon's 3rd king) 

269
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,620
It's distribution.

270
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,140
Distribution?

271
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,220
How to distribute the country's many resources,

272
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,300
where to get it and to whom to give it.

273
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,160
 Politics is sharing and distribution! 

274
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,300
 The question in politics is who to get it from and to whom to give it. 

275
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,040
 From whom do we take and who to fill. 

276
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,000
That...

277
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,640
Is that what you think or is it something you heard from somewhere?

278
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,680
Get rid of all the books in this room.

279
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,800
Yes, Your Highness.

280
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,780
Father, please let me continue reading.

281
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,180
I said you can't!

282
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,500
I will never get in the way of the Crown Prince.

283
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,220
I don't even have the slightest motive.

284
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,260
The books that the crown prince would take six years to read,

285
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:11,040
you finished them all in 2 months. Isn't that eyeing the path of the crown prince?

286
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:18,720
But, Father! How can I live without doing anything?

287
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,820
What?

288
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,680
Aren't I supposed to do at least something as I live?

289
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,720
 I will at least do something. 

290
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,920
 Because if I'm alive, I have to at least do something. 

291
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,360
At that time, I went like this with the sword and heung!

292
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,120
I don't know anything like that. If I stab you, the sword would go in.

293
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,220
And then?

294
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,160
The situation was over because of my powerful aura.

295
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,620
Wow!

296
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,100
The fur ajussi that you put to the sword, what is he doing now?

297
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,980
The fur ajussi became the Ming Emperor.

298
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:13,280
- You are being too much!
- He says he's Master Hong's student. No wonder.

299
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,580
Hey! It's the truth.

300
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,640
No way.

301
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,660
Let's go. Let's go.

302
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,040
Hey. It's the truth!

303
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,680
It's been a while, Moo Hyul!

304
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,900
Moo Hyul.

305
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,980
Yes.

306
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:55,600
Is there still nobody among the people who is smiling?

307
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,400
It's not that but...

308
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,840
As always, you probably still don't like to serve me.

309
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,920
That's why I want to introduce you to someone.

310
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,620
Introduce?

311
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,600
Come in.

312
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,240
He's my third son, Lee Do.

313
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,800
Your Highness.

314
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
He is a very peculiar one.

315
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,220
Peculiar?

316
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,220
He's not like me. He's like the people I miss.

317
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,200
He's the best warrior in Joseon, capable of facing 100 warriors by himself.

318
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,400
Yes, Father.

319
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,720
I don't know about other things but being calm and genuine,

320
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,100
at least I don't think you'll make fun of me.

321
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,400
Don't you want to see her?

322
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,880
I know which island she's on.

323
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,660
Do you want to go?

324
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,400
 Moohaengdo 

325
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,700
Starting this spring, instead of beans,

326
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,280
I'm thinking of planting barley.

327
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,280
Yes. Since we planted beans for three years on the cultivated land, the soil is probably better now.

328
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,640
I also think that way.

329
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,080
Then, starting next year, we will be able to eat until we're full.

330
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,640
Next year, I guess we won't even be jealous of the king!

331
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,040
Leader! Leader!

332
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,800
What's the problem?

333
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,780
Hurry and go out. A boat is coming in.

334
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,300
It seems that you have come back to the palace.

335
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,140
Yes. It turned out like that.

336
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,640
You made the right choice.
 (Boon Yi: Moohaengdo's Leader) 

337
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,560
His Highness must be really happy.

338
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,400
 Moo Hyul: Lee Do's bodyguard 

339
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,120
Actually, His Highness

340
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,580
came with me.

341
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,140
Pardon?

342
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,260
He wants to meet you.

343
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,400
He's waiting at the shore. Do you want to go?

344
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,360
What did she say?

345
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,220
About that...

346
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,840
Is that so?

347
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,900
 If I see Your Highness, I think it will be harder to go on. 

348
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,260
 So I will look at you like this. 

349
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,560
I heard you're the leader of this village.

350
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,720
Yes.

351
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,700
Why are you staring at me like that?

352
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,620
 So you're his son. Still, how can you... 

353
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:36,180
 Prince Chung Nyeong, where are you? It's time go! 

354
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:43,320
I have something to ask you but I have to go now.

355
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,460
Your Highness.

356
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:56,640
Is it okay... for me to hug Your Highness just once?

357
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,670
I'm sorry.

358
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,300
I

359
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,310
just suddenly thought of my childhood.

360
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,690
His Highness the King has been the same, right?

361
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:50,420
Well, he's the same. He's lonely.

362
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,250
 The Anbyeon Chaek 

363
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,860
 has been approved! 

364
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,600
 Give it here. 

365
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,990
 You... I really love you. 

366
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,510
 I won't be able to do anything 

367
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,880
 and I think I will love you until I die. 

368
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,800
 Where ever I am and whatever happens to me, still 

369
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,030
 Boon Yi, you will be smiling somewhere else. 

370
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,600
 For me to be able to think that way. 

371
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,660
Leader, are you really going?

372
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,370
I should go out once before my body becomes weaker.

373
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,560
I don't even know if it will be the last.

374
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,740
- The boat trip is too dangerous.
- The tides seem to be good.

375
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,810
The Japanese pirates aren't around anymore either.

376
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,500
Ah, you talk so much.

377
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,780
You nag too much for a person going on a trip.

378
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,850
I knew you'd be scolded. Let's go, Leader.

379
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,940
 Boon Yi: Moohaengdo's Leader 

380
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,140
It's my first time.

381
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,650
Don't lose your mind and do a good job at escorting Leader.

382
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,120
Then, be careful on your way, Leader.

383
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,740
Grandma, where are we going now?

384
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,910
I'm not sure.

385
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,560
Let's go where ever.

386
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,440
♫ Ga, gya, geo, gyeo, my body with no bounds

387
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,580
Start!

388
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:02,470
♫ Ga, gya, geo, gyeo, my body with no bounds

389
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,760
Look here. The part that you just sang,

390
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,960
"ga, gya, geo, gyeo". The first letter on them is this.

391
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,300
The next part of it is this.

392
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,010
- Ga.
- Ga.

393
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,770
What is that?

394
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,960
- Grandma, this is a letter.
- Letter?

395
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,580
It's a letter that I don't know.

396
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,080
The letters that you know are probably the difficult ones.
 (Mok Ya) 

397
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,590
This is a really easy one.

398
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,620
Actually, His Highness made them.

399
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,840
Grandma, try to learn it to. It's really easy.

400
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,010
Hey, what is that?

401
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,430
Are you doing well?

402
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,320
The children only eat the taffy and leave.

403
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,560
That's why, just like what Chae Yoon said,

404
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,190
"If you don't learn this, you'll get boils!"

405
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,730
- You should've warned them like that.
- Aigoo, what a foolish thing to say.

406
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,610
Do you think the children would study it because they're scared of boils?

407
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,150
This piglet!

408
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,800
You're starting again!

409
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,860
Grandma, do you want to learn these letters?
 (Geun Ji) 

410
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:35,450
When would I finish learning these letters at this age?

411
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,880
They're really easy. Even a fool can learn it in ten days.

412
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,400
A wise man can learn it in a day.

413
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,050
It took me three days.

414
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,800
This piglet here probably took ten days. Right?

415
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,190
I am someone who officially passed the military exam.

416
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,640
A guy like you who came from the North, how dare you compare yourself to me?

417
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,530
Stop fighting already!

418
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,980
 Ten days? Within ten days? 

419
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,170
Did you really

420
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,410
learn all the letters within ten days?

421
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,280
It's not ten days.

422
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,900
Was it eight or nine?

423
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,490
I have a friend called Chae Yoon.

424
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,130
That guy didn't even take an afternoon to learn it all.

425
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:23,640
- Right?
- Could it be...

426
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,740
Can all the letters really

427
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,410
be learned in ten days?

428
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,390
Yes. The reason for that is

429
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,390
all these letters that you're looking at are everything.

430
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:42,520
Yes, Grandma. In all, there are

431
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,570
28 letters.

432
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,880
Twenty-eight letters?

433
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,540
 Communication with the people. 

434
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,230
 I couldn't solve that. 

435
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,250
 It's because the people are in charge of production. 

436
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,860
 The people do not have time to spare. 

437
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,950
 Of course, a few people 

438
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,120
 learned to read and write for a little bit. 

439
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,620
 But for many people, 

440
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,910
 it's an impossible thing. 

441
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,290
 Ajussi. 

442
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,520
That's what I'm saying.

443
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,970
While telling that guy to make such sounds,

444
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,380
His Highness made those strange letters.

445
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,920
No, I...

446
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,410
I only did what His Highness ordered me to.

447
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,740
I didn't know anything about letters.

448
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,870
Does this make sense?

449
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,430
Are we barbarians? Our own letters?

450
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,340
It's something that would make Teacher Sam Bong cry on his grave.

451
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,710
Excuse me, Sir.

452
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,580
What is it about?

453
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,670
If Teacher Sam Bong could see this,

454
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,250
he would be really happy.

455
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,200
This grandma has gone senile.

456
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,920
How can you meddle in a conversation between Sadaebu?

457
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,880
What would a wench like you know?

458
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,650
I know. I do.

459
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,610
That person,

460
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,010
would definitely say he'd found the last path

461
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,000
and he'd be happy.

462
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,610
- Let's go.
- Yes.

463
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,390
This!

464
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,600
 The grave of the person who designed 

465
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,290
 and made this country, how can it look like this? 

466
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,760
 What to do? 

467
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,850
Ajussi.

468
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,890
I came to see you once again.

469
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,250
I'm sorry.

470
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,840
Ajussi.

471
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,210
Bang Won's son

472
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,720
seems to have accomplished something.

473
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:41,380
Grandma, it seems like it's different from what they talk about on the island.

474
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,300
It seems like the world has become better too.

475
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,960
Right?

476
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,150
Grandma.

477
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,740
Is she really sleeping?

478
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:28,270
Goodbye, then.

479
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,890
Right. I'll see you again.

480
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,630
Aren't you being too much?

481
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,940
Still, it's the position you've dreamed to have.

482
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,120
How is it?

483
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,470
My heart flutters every day.

484
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,570
Every day, I get scared.

485
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,330
Every day,

486
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,760
I am lonely.

487
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,270
How is it for you?

488
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,650
Every day, I'm busy.

489
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,390
Every day, I am lonely.

490
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,960
That's great.

491
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,160
You're lonely too.

492
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,260
Still, we cultivate the land together.

493
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,020
We equally share, eat, and live.

494
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,800
You have achieved the equal land reform yourself.

495
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,460
The farming lands are not enough to say that it's an equal land reform.

496
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,780
We're also worried because of Japanese pirates.

497
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,460
Are there Japanese pirates?

498
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,560
Everyone's uneasy.

499
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,600
Though it is better than before.

500
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,980
There's nothing other than this.

501
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,890
I missed you,

502
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,810
Leader Boon Yi.

503
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,640
Why did you let go of Lady Boon Yi back then?

504
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,390
You also allowed me to leave.

505
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:19,050
You could have just not done it.

506
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,310
I couldn't

507
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,250
say no.

508
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,910
 I couldn't say no. 

509
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:35,510
 That was my small consolation to myself. 

510
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,090
 I was not the one I am now. 

511
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:42,590
 The traces of a certain time, 

512
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:45,690
 I wanted to leave it like that. 

513
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,640
 You were all difficult people. 

514
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,600
 You didn't oppose or fight me but... 

515
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,030
 You didn't open your hearts entirely 

516
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,110
 and didn't come into my hands, 

517
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:10,180
 just like the winds and like the people 

518
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,300
General Lee Jung Mo.

519
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,090
Yes, Your Highness.

520
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,290
Where is the base of the Japanese pirates in this area?

521
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,090
It's in Daemado (Tsushima Island), Your Highness.

522
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:50,030
Set up a plan to make Taemado a sea of fire.

523
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,630
Yes, I will do so, Your Highness.

524
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:02,510
Is it because of Lady Boon Yi?

525
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,490
Conquering Taemado.

526
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:14,140
Do you think I still have that kind romance left in me?

527
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:48,530
