2
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,470
Yeon Hee, you know,

3
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,670
now I'm going to join hands with 
the bastards who killed Eun Chang.

4
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,670
It is hard living in a world with war and politics.

5
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,210
Don't be bothered and please do not look back.

6
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,250
 Eun Chang, this is the beginning. 

7
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,550
 Please watch over us until the end. 

8
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,890
 Episode 9 

9
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:33,890
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

10
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,630
I will give my report.

11
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,090
It's been a long time, Ja Il Saek.
 (Cho Young, Hwa Sa Dan's Owner) 

12
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,170
Black spy, Ja Il Saek, at your service, Leader.

13
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,570
Ah, this really thin rabbit is nothing much.

14
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,230
Aigoo, what can we do.

15
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,190
We'll boil it and everyone can have a spoonful each.

16
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,630
That's such small amount!

17
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,450
Aigoo!

18
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,670
Oh?

19
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,210
Who are you?

20
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,290
Who are you? I was asking who you are.

21
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,450
You are Pal Bong's father, right?

22
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,990
You've worked hard.
 (Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon) 

23
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,330
I'm someone sent by  Leader Boon Yi.

24
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,710
Leader Boon Yi?

25
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,690
This is all of the Northeast report.

26
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,570
Also, in the Northeast, the war with Ho Bal Do is just around the corner.
 (Ho Bal Do: Chief of the Yeojin tribe) 

27
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,930
What happened?

28
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,650
Considering the ability of Lee Seong Gye's army, it is expected that they will be able to prevent it.

29
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,890
So probably, Lee Seong Gye will send the documents over to the King soon.

30
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:27,230
The An Byeon Chaek's purpose is to defeat Ho Bal Do.

31
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,370
These are the contents.

32
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,990
An Byeon Chaek?

33
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,570
What nonsense...

34
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,470
How can something like this be approved by Goryeo's Do Dang?

35
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,110
Yes, that is right.

36
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,550
Among the 120 members of Do Dang, 
ten are on Jeong Mong Joo's side.

37
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,690
Choi Yeong's side also has ten people.

38
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,770
Including the few simpleminded Sadaebu, there will be about that many people who will approve of it.

39
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,410
Before Lee In Gyeom dies, even if Heaven and earth open up,

40
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,450
it is something that will never happen.

41
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,770
Then, I will take my leave.

42
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,770
Have you collected any information regarding Jeong Do Jeon?

43
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,130
Jeong Do Jeon?

44
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,830
I haven't collected any information but should I try to find out?

45
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,290
Yes. If you can do it, try to find out.

46
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,330
 To the extent of going against my superior's orders, 

47
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,190
 I wagered my destiny on you, Jeong Do Jeon. 

48
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,150
 Please accomplish it. 

49
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,450
If you don't, then you

50
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,370
will die by me, Ja Il Saek.

51
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,930
Do you know that, Sam Bong?

52
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,790
Why are you doing this? Please release me then we can talk.

53
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,450
This is the last time. You don't get another chance.

54
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,890
If you speak nonsense again, you'll be on your way to the underworld. Do you understand?

55
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,630
Does Leader Boon Yi have an older brother or not?

56
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,270
She does! She surely does!

57
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,130
Eight, nine years ago, when she came to Gaegyeong,

58
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,470
Boon Yi and her brother held on to me and asked about their mother.

59
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,490
What is Leader Boon Yi's brother's name?

60
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,410
It has a "Sae" in it...

61
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:59,490
Definitely... There's a "Sae" in it... "Gae Sae"?

62
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,630
What?
 (Gae Sae can also mean son of a b****) 

63
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,550
This!!

64
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,230
Ddang Sae!

65
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,470
That's right, Ddang Sae! Yes, that's right. It's Ddang Sae! Ddang Sae!

66
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,910
Was it Ddang Sae?

67
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,090
- R-Right!
- Ddang Sae is right.

68
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,270
Ddang Sae?

69
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,090
He was really sent by Leader!

70
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,590
So he knows Ddang Sae!

71
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,250
He's on our side.

72
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,810
Aigoo. Aigoo.

73
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,930
 If we go together until then, what happens after that? 

74
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,370
 Leave this Goryeo, 

75
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,710
 if you and I compete on a single battle with fate on the line, 

76
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,250
 wouldn't it be a really interesting thing in a man's life? 

77
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,650
 Until then, please trust me. I will help you. 

78
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,690
 So what do you want me to do?
 
 

79
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,950
 Do Dang's three high ministers 

80
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,670
 Lee In Gyeom 

81
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,350
 Hong In Bang 

82
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,650
 Gil Tae Mi 

83
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,130
 Armed Forces 

84
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,890
 Choi Yeong 

85
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,270
 Lee Seong Gye 

86
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,430
This is the power framework now.

87
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,250
Try to change your perspective.

88
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,510
Like this, Lee In Gyeom and Choi Yeong are on one side.

89
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,970
What if you, Gil Tae Mi, and General Lee Seong Gye are in one side?

90
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,870
Don't you think it's possible?

91
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,510
Because of General Choi Yeong, you have no choice but to always show your weakness. That kind of weakness against power

92
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,550
will be neatly solved.

93
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,390
But there's no way that Lee Seong Gye will be on our side.

94
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,310
Just approve the An Byeon Chaek that 
General Lee Seong Gye petitioned to the Do Dang.

95
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,310
If you do that, General Lee Seong Gye will become your advantage.

96
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,070
 Tomorrow at the Do Dang meeting, the agenda 
regarding the An Byeon Chaek will be put up. 

97
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,770
 An Byeon Chaek? 

98
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,550
An Byeon Chaek? Does Lee Seong Gye protect the country by himself?

99
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,710
How is it that only the Northeastern side will independently have the military supplies?

100
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,190
With Ho Bal Do's prestige, it's a time when we are not sure when a war might start.
 (Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo) 

101
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,030
Are there better alternatives than this An Byeon Chaek?

102
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,650
Then are you going to make other borders independent as well?

103
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,570
The northeastern region is a no man's land. (Byeong Ga Pil Jeng: a desperate dispute to take hold of something) 

104
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,190
Other borders are significantly different.

105
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,090
Also, General Lee Seong Gye is different from those people who steal wealth from the citizens.

106
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,210
Yes, if we trust General Lee Seong Gye 
and follow and uphold the An Byeon Chaek,

107
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,730
it will become a durable wall that protects Goryeo.

108
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,350
Between the Yeojin tribe and the Japanese pirates, shouldn't we make ourselves safe from at least one of them?

109
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,510
Look here, everyone! What are you saying?

110
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,750
Are you saying that we only steal wealth from the people
 (Woo Hak Joo) 

111
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,870
and only you and Lee Seong Gye are loyal subjects that protect the country?

112
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,590
Do you how many soldiers and how much wealth we donate whenever there is war? How can you say such things?

113
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,810
Let's say the An Byeon Chaek gets approved,
 

114
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,070
the same thing will be enforced to all areas of Goryeo.

115
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,770
If you only protect the Northeastern side then the whole of Goryeo will--

116
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,970
Ah, shut up!

117
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

118
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,190
Okay, okay. Everyone be quiet.

119
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,350
Since we have heard enough opinions regarding this agenda,
 (Lee In Gyeom) 

120
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,930
we will do the voting in the next Do Dang meeting.

121
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,550
What do you mean by voting!

122
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,890
 The An Byeon Chaek is something that can never happen. 

123
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,130
To ensure the safety of the North, the An Byeon Chaek is needed.

124
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,190
General.

125
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,530
- My Lord, please open the door.
- This is not fair.

126
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,270
Isn't that your house, General?

127
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,590
What could have happened for the people to be like that?

128
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,830
 General, please! 

129
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,990
 Aigoo... 

130
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:47,250
If it's lacquered, I probably know the person but this is a first. Who made this?

131
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,330
It's made in Wonju, Gyojugangreungdo.

132
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,090
As expected.

133
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,910
I see why the Imperial People of China seek this out.

134
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,590
A provocative purple

135
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:06,670
and a different level of gold. Wow! This is something you cannot procure with wealth alone.

136
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,510
I know that you were gravely upset because of me.

137
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:15,230
I want to sincerely apologize. It's nothing much but I brought it with me.

138
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,190
From now on, I will pledge loyalty to the person above me.

139
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,630
Please forgive me.

140
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,110
You should not dream of achieving nonsense again. Do you understand?

141
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,230
Yes, Hap Ha.
 (Hap Ha: respectful name for Lee In Gyeom) 

142
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,850
You bastards! Put down your swords and surrender!

143
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,610
Elder Dae Sa Seong! Please save us!
 (Dae Sa Seong: Leader of Sungkyunkwan) 

144
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,130
What are you doing?

145
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,290
How dare you do this knowing who's house it is?

146
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,870
We know that it is your house but we also have our orders.

147
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,250
Orders? Whose order?

148
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,670
I sent that order.

149
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,850
A tilled wasteland ought to be contributed to the national treasury.
 (Choi Yeong) 

150
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,490
You also know that, right?

151
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,790
But the wasteland that was tilled in Deok Jin Hyeon of the Western district

152
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,090
was put under the name of Dae Geun, one of your servants.

153
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,010
That's why I ordered them to arrest everyone connected to that.

154
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,830
What are you doing? Arrest them immediately!

155
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,190
Yes!

156
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,210
Elder, Elder!

157
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,370
Take them with us.

158
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,070
Please save us, Elder Dae Sa Seong!

159
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,470
Elder!

160
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,950
 Please save us! 

161
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,230
 Elder Dae Sa Seong, please save us! 

162
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,430
 Elder Dae Sa Seong! 

163
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,370
I will closely investigate them and expose how it happened. As for you Dae Sa Seong,

164
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,170
I hope that you don't have anything to do with it.

165
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,970
 There is one thing that I have never forgotten.
 Lee In Gyeom! Choi Yeong! 

166
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,690
 We can't just leave them be. We have to make them fall! 

167
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,250
Aigoo. Aigoo.

168
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,030
What happened?

169
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,330
Aigoo, as you said, we confessed to General Choi Yeong.

170
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,070
Ah, all of Hong In Bang's servants were taken.

171
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,150
It was total chaos!

172
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,810
This time, it will be the end of Hong In Bang's servants, right?

173
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,890
You'd have to wait on that.

174
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,670
But this time, Hong In Bang has been caught in a trap.

175
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,530
Trap?

176
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,550
 Now, he won't be able to get away from the words I said. 

177
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,170
 What are you going to do, Hong In Bang? 

178
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,230
 Choi Yeong and Lee In Gyeom will surely not stop there. 

179
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,350
What happened here, In-law?

180
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,190
Choi Yeong, that old man... I can't take this anymore!

181
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,350
Why does he always make a fool of us?

182
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,610
This won't do. Let's go to Hap Ha.

183
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,190
Hap Ha will take care of everything.

184
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,170
Whether it is about the country or the taxes, Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi

185
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,710
don't follow what I say.

186
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,090
Do you sincerely

187
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,090
believe that Hong In Bang will act like your hands and feet?

188
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,150
Gil Tae Mi is someone who's words and actions are frivolous and he's loyal,

189
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,230
so you can keep him under you but Hong In Bang is different.

190
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,150
He might seem like he's bowing down right now but in the end, with his lies

191
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,010
he will move Gil Tae Mi and make Woo Hak Joo his servant.

192
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,250
At that time, even if you want to kick him out, you won't be able to.

193
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,850
I'm saying that you must eliminate only Hong In Bang.

194
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,110
He's someone who's not supposed to be part of the Do Dang in the first place.

195
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,310
Do you really not like Hong In Bang?

196
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:16,110
He's still a little immature but I'm thinking that he's someone worth raising.

197
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,790
In the year of Eul Myo, the Sadaebu were taken and Hong In Bang was also tortured.

198
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,470
But that person's actions are contradictory.

199
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,750
It didn't even take him 15 minutes to ask to be saved and say that he would reflect.

200
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,530
Also, after coming back from exile, he became Gil Tae Mi's in-law and renounced his belief.

201
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,430
It didn't even take a month. He's that kind of person.

202
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,390
If this is war, please trust me this once.

203
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,290
It is now. You must throw him out now!

204
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,690
 Is it a fake hand or a real hand? 

205
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,530
 Is it really because he wants to strike down Hong In Bang? 

206
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:02,610
 Or is he making a deal regarding the An Byeon Chaek with this? 

207
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,250
Dae Sa Seong Hong In Bang is here. Should I lead him in?

208
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,470
Elder is not feeling well. Please come again next time.

209
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,190
How come he's not feeling well now? He looked okay a while ago.

210
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,130
Is he with General Choi Yeong?

211

Are you telling me to personally go to Ham Joo?

213
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,930
Yes. Hurry and go.
 (Jeok Ryeong, Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk) 

214
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,870
Are you really going to join hands with Lee Seong Gye?

215
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,310
You have to find  out if he is being truthful.

216
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,770
If I join hands with him, what can he do for me

217
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,570
and what can I do for him.

218
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,990
Will the An Byeon Chaek alone do?

219
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,850
Please find out his condition and true intention.

220
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,270
Hong In Bang will have uneasiness and suspicion running in his mind.

221
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,410
Then, will it go according to our plan?

222
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,010
Things working out will be a decision that hangs on Heaven.

223
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,630
Even when Zhūgě Liàng's plan was perfect,

224
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,690
it suddenly rained hard so he didn't catch Sima Yi.

225
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,730
Yes. That's why we call it Cheon Woo,

226
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,170
as in Heaven's rain.

227
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,970
Right. We don't know what change will happen from here on,

228
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,070
so we can only do whatever is humanly possible.

229
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,210
What happened to what I asked you before?

230
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,350
I will meet him soon. He's the most famous Kang Chang Sa in Gaegyeong.

231
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,570
 (Kang Chang Sa: an entertainer specializing in storytelling)

 (Ddang Sae: later Lee Bang Ji) 

233
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,150
I told you to fix this habit, right? Where did you get this precious thing...

234
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,470
Good job.

235
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,170
Ah, no. It's not that.

236
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,920
A Madam of a certain rich household told me what needs to be in our performance
 (Gap Boon) 

237
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,910
and put into  a song. She said she will give us five more of these.

238
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,720
Five? What is it about?

239
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,880
Well that...

240
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,580
"Baek Yoon was killed by Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi."

241
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,490
What could it be? They probably didn't ask for it knowing that you did it, right?

242
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,940
Where is that person right now?

243
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,700
That person asked you to meet her.

244
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,260
You said you were looking for a storyteller so I came.

245
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,780
I heard that you are the best storyteller in Gaegyeong. Is that right?

246
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,130
Well, they all say that.

247
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,970
All of you, leave.

248
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,810
Yes.

249
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:51,110
Please make a song out of that and do a performance.

250
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,230
That's what I always do. It's not even work.

251
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:02,010
But, is this true?

252
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,510
Is that important?

253
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,050
Well, it's not that.

254
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:13,380
Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi killing Baek Yoon

255
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,210
must be clearly delivered.

256
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,160
Yes.

257
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,660
When the rumors spread and reach me, I will give you five more of what you have received.

258
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,320
If I hear about it within four days

259
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,410
I will give you double the original five.

260
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,580
So do your best...

261
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,010
So...

262
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,810
Do your best...

263
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,550
The faster the better... To you...

It's been a long time.

276
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,050
That's right.

277
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,070
"As long as I'm alive...

278
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,140
there will come a day when we will meet." That's what I thought.

279
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,580
"As time goes by,

280
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,820
there will be a day we will meet."

We...

283
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,860
I don't know if we'll ever see each other again

284
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,040
but even if we do,

285
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,420
you just need to pretend that you don't know me.

286
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,110
Time did pass and, since we already met,

287
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,500
let's just

288

pass by.

Fine.

290
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,900

♫  The more I forget, the more it stings  ♫

Cry? Me?

312
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,110
You're saying nonsense.

313
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,210
You did cry.

314
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,630
You must have heard of it. Right?

315
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,930
What?

316
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,590
The village where you used to live was called Deok Jin Hyeon, right?

317
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,530
People were caught cultivating a wasteland and got into trouble.

318
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,010
 A government office was set on fire, many died and many got hurt. 

319
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,360
 They said it was all done by Hong In Bang. 

320
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,210
What is it again?
 (Ham Joo 

321
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,920
You said you didn't like first level training so I moved you. See how good this is? It's comfortable.

322
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,950
I'm not someone who should be clearing dung here.
 (Moo Hyul) 

323
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,950
You also know that I saved your young master's life not once but twice.

324
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,580
Hey! I don't know what you heard that you're doing this,
 (Jo Young Gyu) 

325
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,980
but just going in and getting a position through connections

326
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,120
does not happen in Ham Joo. You need to earn it on  your own merits!

327
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,290
Like this, merits? Like this, merits?

328
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,790
I will get merits if I do well in spreading dung?

329
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,560
Will the merits just appear?

330
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,420
How can I earn merits by being here?

331
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,500
Aigoo, this. I ought to just!

332
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,730
- Oh?
- Oh?

333
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,580
Merits!

334
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,460
A suspicious man came wanting to meet Father.
 (Lee Ji Ran) 

335
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,190
General is not someone you can meet just because you want to.

336
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,910
That... He said he has something to say about the An Byeon Chaek.

337
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,720
What did you say? An Byeon Chaek?

338
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,150
How did he know about it?

339
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,300
Did you say that you have something to talk to the General about the An Byeon Chaek?

340
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,420
Yes.

341
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,190
Ah, because it's urgent, I will just talk about the important things.

342
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,600
I was sent by Dae Sa Seong's Hong In Bang.

343
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,280
- Hong In Bang?
- Yes.

344
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,030
If Dae Sa Seong uses his power and gets the An Byeon Chaek approved,

345
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,500
he is asking what General Lee Seong Gye can  give him in return.

346
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,950
How did that person know about the An Byeon Chaek?

347
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:58,070
Yes. Of course, he knows about it. It's already under discussion in the Do Dang.

348
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,060
Isn't that why he sent Sam Bong to Ham Joo?

349
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,600
Let's not do this and just let me meet General Lee Seong Gye.

350
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,270
Hurry. Yes?

351
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,050
Gyo Ui, tell General about it.
 (Gyo Ui is Lee Bang Gwa's title rank in the organization) 

352
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,690
Yes.

353
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,060
- Why did that person come to Ham Joo?
- Do you know that person?

354
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,760
He's the head monk of Bi Guk Temple who sent those spies.

355
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,400
- What?
- What exactly are you saying?

356
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,330
Are you saying that I sent the An Byeon Chaek to the Do Dang through Sam Bong?
 

357
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,560
Yes. It's already under discussion in the Do Dang.

358
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,410
I definitely received it with your stamp on it, General.

359
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,270
That's why Sam Bong went to Gaegyeong with it.

360
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,310
Who exactly gave it to you?

361
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,190
Bang Won gave it...

362
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,110
Could it be...

363
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,800
Are you saying that Bang Won gave it to you?

364
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,240
Yes.

365
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,360
Young Gyu, immediately go to Ji Ran and tell him to arrest Jeok Ryong.

366
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,280
Yes.

367
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,150
And you, immediately catch Bang Won!

368
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,200
Yes.

369
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,910
Bang Gwa, I will write a letter

370
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,300
so immediately go to Gaegyeong,

371
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,990
and tell General Choi Yeong and Lee In Gyeom

372
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,370
that it wasn't my intention to send the An Byeon Chaek.

373
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,770
Yes. I'll prepare right away.

374
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,810
 So what? 

375
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,450
Well, what could I ask you, Young Master.

376
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,020
Even if I didn't save you twice, TWICE,

377
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,580
still, when something goes, something comes back...

378
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,340
You...
 (Lee Bang Won) 

379
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,670
What do you think about this Goryeo?

380
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,810
Yes? Goryeo?

381
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,650
Goryeo is Goryeo. But more than Goryeo, I...

382
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,710
I'm saying that please 'goryeo' my position.
 (Goryeo is the country but can also mean 'consider') 

383
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,870
You should also 'goryeo' my situation.

384
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:27,250
What? Why should I 'goryeo' your situation when you're General Lee Seong Gye's son?

385
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,190
General Lee Seong Gye's son should 'goryeo' my position.

386
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,270
You know, that 'goryeo'...

387
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,670
It's something that goes both ways. If only one side will 'goryeo'...

388
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,210
Aigoo. 'Goryeo, Goryeo', please stop that! I'm tired of it!

389
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,860
That's right. You too.

390
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,970
You're also tired of this country, 'Goryeo', right?
 (He's still playing with the word 'goryeo'/consider + name of country) 

391
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,160
What? The 'goryeo' that I was talking about is not that 'goryeo'...

392
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,880
That?

393
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,440
I won't be fooled. Don't talk about something else.

394
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,980
Young Master! Lady! Lady, Young...

395
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,440
Young...

396
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,190
Go.

397
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,740
It's been found out. They know that you secretly stamped the An Byeon Chaek and sent it.

398
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,890
How?

399
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,480
Bi Guk Temple's Jeok Ryong came. Hong In Bang sent him.

400
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,490
Hong In Bang?

401
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,740
The General ordered that you and Jeok Ryong be arrested.
 (Boon Yi) 

402
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,590
Gyo Ui Lee Bang Gwa was sent to Gaegyeong.

403
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,590
What's with Hyung?

404
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,290
An Byeon Chaek! Of course, they are withdrawing it.

405
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,100
That won't do.

406
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,170
Think about it. The reason why Hong In Bang sent Jeok Ryong is because things are going well,

407
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,420
but they are going to withdraw it?

408
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,440
What are you going to do?

409
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,810
I have to go to Gaegyeong. I'll go there,

410
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,120
stop Hyung-nim and help Teacher Sam Bong.

411
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,250
Eh? Why are you doing this? Who are you, trying to get into trouble?

412
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,820
If the horses here disappear, then it will be my responsibility.

413
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,260
I will 'goryeo' your position.

414
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,530
From here on, you are

415
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,070
a second rank Buk Doo body guard who will protect me.
 (He made up an imaginary rank to fool Moo Hyul.) 

416
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,020
Buk Doo... What? What is that?

417
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,670
There is something like that.

418
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,670
You said you want this, right?

419
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,170
Here's the proof!

420
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,910
Yes. I will serve you, Young Master... No, my Lord!

421
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,120
Bang Won, you bastard!

422
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,150
You bastard! How dare you forge the document!
 (Lee Shin Jeok) 

423
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,140
Why did you do such an outrageous thing?

424
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,620
I had to send it. I will go...

425
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,270
I need to help Teacher Sam Bong.

426
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,690
Your lying tongue...

427
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,190
I won't be fooled by it again.

428
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,440
Get him!

429
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,250
What are you doing? Buk Doo body guard!

430
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,960
Yes.

431
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,040
Buk Doo body guard, 'Warrior Moo Hyul"!

432
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,900
You should come too.

433
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,220
I... can't ride a horse.

434
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,400
If you get on the horse, it will just go!

435
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,780
Have you heard the rumors?

436
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,070
We're already talking about it.

437
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,370
"Gil Tae Mi,

438
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,550
through Dae Sa Seong Hong In Bang's lead, killed Baek Yoon."

439
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,270
It's spread widely through out the town.

440
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,200
It's already been covered up. Why is this kind of rumor...

441
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,390
Could it be...

442
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,400
You didn't really do it, right?

443
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,550
Why would we kill Baek Yoon? Of course, it's not true.

444
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,100
It's not important whether we killed him or not.

445
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,960
The important thing is that someone intended to spread the rumor.

446
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,520
Yes. Who is that someone?

447
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,180
Isn't it Hap Ha or General Choi Yeong?

448
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,560
It has already been decided.

449
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,930
They decided to throw the two of you out.

450
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,580
 What happened? 

451
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,370
 Jeok Ryong, how come you don't have any news yet? 

452
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:19,360
Now's the time. To think that a rumor like this has spread.

453
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Heaven is also helping us. Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi.

454
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,350
Let's take them out.

455
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,310
Just give us your approval to investigate.

456
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,250
I will surely get a confession.

457
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,220
Fine.

458
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,180
But exclude Gil Tae Mi.

459
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,300
Tae Mi.

460
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,180
The day you first came to the Do Dang,

461
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,800
do you remember?

462
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,760
How to dress, how to preserve the decorum,

463
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,080
with a funny face,

464
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,680
you asked me that while chattering and following me around all day.

465
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,090
But

466
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,930
you've grown to lead a whole department.

467
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,300
Is it still

468
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,250
not enough?

469
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,940
What?

470
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,360
But a lowly bastard like you,

471
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,760
right now,

472
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,230
aren't you after that outrageously high position too?

473
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,730
Your bastard in-law came all the way up here to cut me down, right?

474
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,030
Elder, it's not that. I'm just...

475
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,510
Hong In Bang. That bastard is an persuader.

476
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,950
I will cut down that persuader. What will you do?

477
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:12,860
Are you going to die with that persuader or are you going to come back and do it with me?

478
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,460
I've watched you since you were eight-years old.

479
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,600
Your life,

480
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,530
should I twist it with my own hands?

481
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,650
If it can only happen,

482
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,870
I will do it as much as I want.

483
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,820
 Western district's Deok Jin Hyeon 

484
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,740
Who is it?

485
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,250
Where did everyone go?

486
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,340
What happened?

487
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,600
 Everyone was beaten to death by Hong In Bang's servants! 

488
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,980
 While protecting the crops of our blood and sweat, 

489
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,680
 everyone got beaten and died. 

490
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,560
 How did you know Boon Yi? 

491
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,030
 Still, a few of them came back 

492
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,600
 but Boon Yi didn't. 

493
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,810
 Sam Bong, why? 

494
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,220
Why!

495
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,650
 Sam Bong, 
I killed Baek Yoon according to your Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye.
  

496
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:08,610
 but this world has become worse. 

497
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,540
 Still, I endured and waited. 

498
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:17,270
 No matter how much I wait, you don't appear. 

499
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,550
 While doing so, the world is becoming more terrible. 

500
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:28,530
 Now, I don't need that peaceful plan or you anymore. 

501
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,680
 I will just kill everyone, one by one. 

502
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,880
 Hong In Bang. That bastard is a persuader! 

503
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,610
 I will cut down that persuader. What are you going to do? 

504
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,270
Gil Tae Mi has probably abandoned Hong In Bang.

505
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,760
Yes. He is at the top as a warrior, but due to his background,

506
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,950
while being uneasy careful of powerful people,

507
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,180
if he finds something disadvantageous, he will turn back at any time

508
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,610
He must be anxious.

509
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,730
In Hong In Bang's mind there's only

510
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,110
the name Lee Seong Gye remaining.

511
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,690
To a drowning person, if you hold out a knife

512
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,390
he will still hold onto it like a crazy person.

513
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:34,570
He will come to me soon. And to Hong In Bang's urgent hand,

514
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,280
I will hold out a knife.

515
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,020
 How come there is still no news from Jeok Ryong? 

516
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,310
 Just what did Lee Seong Gye... 

517
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,140
Why are you being like this? Get ahold of yourself.

518
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,930
 It appears that he was abandoned by Hap Ha and Gil Tae Mi. 

519
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:10,210
 Hong In Bang, why did you trust a person like Gil Tae Mi? 

520
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,670
 That person, t-that person... Why here? 

521
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,140
 Gil Tae Mi... Why? 

522
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,300
 Could it be that he didn't betray Hong In Bang? 

523
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:02,810
In-law, do you know  what's the most important thing for a warrior to become strong?

524
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:10,010
Bowing the head, lying flat down. Why?

525
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,350
If you incorrectly hold your head high, you die.

526
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,490
If  you die, it's the end. If you die, you cannot become any stronger.

527
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,300
With the Sadaebu, if they stick their head up wrongly, it will be fine as long as they go into exile and come back.

528
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,540
But it's different for warriors. If something goes wrong, we die.

529
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,930
Do you know how submissive I was to Hong Ryun before?

530
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:38,280
We were the same age but I have never spoken to him comfortably.

531
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,860
Like that, I gained power.

532
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,500
The result, as you already know, is this.

533
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,400
What are you trying to say?

534
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,170
Hap Ha told me to withdraw.

535
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,600
It will work out as long as you are targeted.

536
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,520
So what?

537
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,910
I must be getting old. I couldn't take the Elder's nagging.

538
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,850
So I'm thinking of seeing this to the end with you.

539
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:23,140
Honestly, if not for you, I would be just running errands under the Elder forever.

540
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,360
But thinking about it, forever would be tiring.

541
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,170
So, do you have a way to survive?

542
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,610
I do.

543
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,950
Let's give up on half of our assets.

544
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,190
Let's completely lay flat.

545
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,780
Just like what I did with Hong Ryun.

546
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,960
 Kneel down. 

547
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,210
 What if I give you half of my assets? 

548
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,620
 What? 

549
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,510
 Then our followers of the clan will be reduced to half 

550
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,070
 I will also give you half of my power. 

551
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,300
 Hong In Bang. 

552
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,960
 Do you think that man will do that? 

553
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,610
 If he does that, will you save him? 

554
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,610
If that works out...

555
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,240
Something went wrong. Look!

556
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,790
He offered half of his assets and persuaded Hong In Bang.

557
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,490
I've overlooked something about Gil Tae Mi.

558
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,150
Then...

559
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,440
I need to go to Gaegyeong. I need to meet Hong In Bang.

560
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,040
-What?
-You shoud not withdraw the An Byeon Chaek, Hyung-nim.

561
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,830
It's something that you've longed for a long time too, right?

562
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,140
Bang Won. I don't know if what you're saying is right,

563
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,800
but I will follow Father's orders.

564
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,180
My wish is not important.

565
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,960
Hyung-nim.

566
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,740
I will sincerely apologize for this in the future.

567
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,850
What?

568
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:25,080
- Moo Hyul.
- Yes?

569
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,370
You'd have to escort Hyung-nim.

570
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,890
What are you going to do?

571
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,600
Is it very tight?

572
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,340
You bastard! Hurry and untie me. I have to stop Bang Won!

573
00:47:55,110 --> 00:48:00,650
I'm sorry. I am his second rank Buk Doo bodyguard... I have to follow his orders.

574
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,810
'Buk Doo' what?

575
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,370
Then, I'll be going.

576
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:19,680
You made the right choice, In-law.

577
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,230
I also think it's a waste. I feel like dying, really.

578
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:29,430
Just close your eyes and let's announce it tomorrow at the Do Dang.

579
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,960
It's my first time saying this, but

580
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,230
thank you.

581
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:43,400
What? Hey... That's embarrassing.

582
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,540
We must be really drunk.

583
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,710
Let's go pee.

584
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:08,060
Dae Sa Seong Hong In Bang.

585
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,060
Who are you?

586
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,960
 Well... 

587
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,660
 Your face reading says you won't live long anyway. 

588
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:45,860
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
The Flying Dragons Team at Viki.com 

589
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,210
What are you doing? Is nobody out there?

590
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,950
You're the one who killed Baek Yoon, right?

591
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,060
Did Choi Yeong send you?

592
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,240
If not, was it Hap Ha who sent you?

593
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,710
My Lord, are you okay?

594
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,980
Where are you going?

595
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,620
I'm going to Hong In Bang.

596
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,470
Hong In Bang? What are you going to do?

597
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,350
You watch the situation

598
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:21,930
and if something happens, let those in Ham Joo  know what's going on.

599
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,690
Also, Teacher Sam Bong.

600
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,550
I'm asking what you are going to do if you go there.

601
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,550
I will solve Hong In Bang's concerns for him.

602
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:42,570
 Lee In Gyeom... Did you really send an assassin to kill me? 

603
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:47,280
 Jeok Ryong, why is he not back yet? 

604
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,270
I need to see Elder Dae Sa Seong!

605
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,180
What brings you here during this time of the night?

606
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,260
Because that person called Jeok Ryong didn't come back,

607
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,600
are you getting anxious?

608
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,320
You didn't trust Father's intentions so you sent Jeok Ryong.

609
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,070
So did General Lee Seong Gye send you?

610
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,090
Yes. I came by Father's command.

611
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,260
What about Jeok Ryong?

612
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:23,040
That person is under detention in Ham Joo.

613
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,780
What?

614
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,010
So you can just keep me as your hostage.

615
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,930
By doing so, wouldn't you be able to trust each other?

616
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:35,230
Approve the An Byeon Chaek tomorrow.

617
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,970
The dealings will take place after that.

618
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,690
You must strictly be on guard.

619
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,470
Yes!

620
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,450
Cheon Woo has come.
 (Cheon Woo: Heaven's rain) 

621
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,510
Cheon Woo?

622
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,590
Someone came to assassinate Hong In Bang at Hwa Sa Dan.

623
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,630
It seems to be that unknown warrior.

624
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,230
Now, Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi...

625
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:02,050
He will surely think that Choi Yeong and Lee In Gyeom did it.

626
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,040
Cheon Woo has really poured down.

627
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,630
Okay, it is my turn now.

628
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,410
I lost him. He's a skilled bastard. His swordsmanship is better than Hong Ryun.

629
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,350
To think that he was raising someone like that behind my back. I cannot forgive him.

630
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,610
I already told him that we're offering half of our assets.

631
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,650
But do you know what Hap Ha said?

632
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,290
While smiling he said, "If that will happen."

633
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,570
"If that will happen", he says but sends an assassin?

634
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:37,010
In-law, I'd have to kill Choi Yeong tonight.

635
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,830
In-law!

636
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,980
You must not do that.

637
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,800
They meddled with me first. Me, Gil Tae Mi!

638
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,580
They drew the sword first so if I don't kill them,

639
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:51,160
I'd have to prepare to die. Do you know that?

640
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,520
My Lord! A certain scholar came asking to see you.

641
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,880
A scholar? Who did he say he is?

642
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:21,480
Today, Gil Tae Mi and Hong In Bang will make an important announcement.

643
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,980
First, let's go inside.

644
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:36,510
 That's right. Today, the An Byeon Chaek will be rejected 

645
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,680
 so he's turned sulky. 

646
00:54:55,060 --> 00:55:00,260
There are multiple agendas for today.

647
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:05,920
First, as we discussed at the last Do Dang meeting,

648
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,700
we will do a voting regarding the An Byeon Chaek.

649
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,120
After calculations regarding this matter,

650
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,000
you must have decided between right and the wrong, right?

651
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:27,530
Then, first...

652
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:35,600
regarding the An Byeon Chaek, those who are against it, please stand up.

653
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,940
What are you doing? Now, you have to ask those who are in favor of it.

654
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:24,460
Then, those who are in favor of it, please stand up.

655
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,820
 Hong In Bang, you bastard. 

656
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,040
 I've joined hands with General Lee Seong Gye. 

657
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,100
 You made the right choice, Brother. 

658
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,840
 Meet General Choi Yeong and do as I tell you. 

659
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,150
 I will make it so that the An Byeon Chaek gets approved. 

660
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,000
 What? 

661
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,640
 You can just take the next chance to catch and kill me and Gil Tae Mi. 

662
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,140
 However, the An Byeon Chaek will forever be put off to the distance after this time. 

663
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,380
 Hold on to my hand for a little bit now 

664
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,360
 and cut my head off next time. 

665
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,600
 I was the one who trusted you and decided to offer half of my assets. 

666
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,710
 This time, please trust me, In-law. 

667
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:40,690
 It's something that will create a new advantage. 

668
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,340
 Ah, I don't know! 

669
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,740
 Okay. Let's do it. 

670
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,140
What are you doing? You should make a proclamation.

671
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,580
79:41. The An Byeon Chaek has been approved.

672
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,250
The An Byeon Chaek

673
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,780
has been passed.

674
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:56,830
 Now, the base of revolution has been decided. 

675
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:07,570
 Hong In Bang, in the end, your ambition 

676
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:10,830
 has lit the fire of revolution. 

677
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:22,940

 Six Flying Dragons 

679
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,580
 The An Byeon Chaek 

680
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,210
 got approved! 

681
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,970
 You back-stabbed me? 

682
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,430
 You sent an assassin last night! 

683
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,110
 Who could that warrior be? 

684
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,160
 Ddang Sae, you were that warrior? 

685
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,180
 I want to do it with you. 

686
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,220
 I have already acted on it. 

687
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,360
 How dare you! 

688
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,870
 I did it according to your plan 

689
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,590
 but this rotten Goryeo is far from ending 

690
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,770
 and just rotting and collapsing even more. 

691
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,630
 If I ever meet you again, 

692
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,860
 I might kill you then.
