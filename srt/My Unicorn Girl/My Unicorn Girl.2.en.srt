Fate between human beings...

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,880
It's like all sorts of threads
that entangled destiny.

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,600
Some threads are red.

9
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,880
Some are white.

10
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,880
And you are entangled by a black thread.

11
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,920
A black thread ?

12
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,880
What am I thinking about?

13
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,550
Why would old granny be here?

Old granny.

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,110
Are you waiting for me?

17
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,110
Yes, I am waiting for you.

18

Do you need my help?

19
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,440
Old granny, how can I untangle...

20
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,350
the dark thread of the destiny...

21
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
that you said yesterday?

22
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,550
Didn't you say you don't believe it?

23
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,270
You look at me now.

24
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,640
I can't go home.

25
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,790
I can't go to school.

26
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,950
Please be merciful and help me.

27
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,480
Here, have a seat.

28
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,600
Did you meet your fated one in your life?

29
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,670
It should be a lingering person.

30
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,200
Did he take something precious
away from you?

31
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,560
Yes or no?

32
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,600
But that hockey stick is not valuable.

33
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,550
Not this.

34
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,350
Think properly.

35
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,640
My first kiss.

36
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,159
That's right.

37
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,110
You became unlucky...

38
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,390
because he had taken away
your first kiss.

39
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,600
If you want to untangle
the dark threads of destiny,

40
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,720
you should take the same thing
away from him.

41
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,270
What is it?

42
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,830
His kiss.

43
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,110
I don't believe it.

44
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,230
Was he wearing a black sweater?

45
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,200
Old granny, how did you know that?

46
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,000
I saw it.

47
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,200
I saw it.

His is emitting
a dark aura from his body.

49

Suddenly, a white flash appeared.

50
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,159
And your destiny...

51
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,270
started to get entangled
by the dark threads.

52

Am I right?

53
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,720
Koi, what do you think?

54
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Old granny, it's not good to lie.

55
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,670
Don't do it anymore.

56

Maybe not.

Don't ever let your classmates
know about it.

That old woman was right.

97

It must be that unlucky kiss.

98

This must be a coincidence.

99

It can't be that kiss.

100

But you are not the only one
who became unlucky...

101

after your first kiss had been taken away.

102
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,520
Sister Xiao Rou and I became unlucky too.

103

You can ask Sister Xiao Rou if
you don't believe me.

104

Xiao Rou, what happened?

105
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,110
I spilt the milk tea,

106
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,910
so I had to compensate the customer
for the price of the suit.

107
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,470
My salary for this month is gone.

Previously, I used to be benefited

Now I will be unlucky
when following you.

I think that kiss must be poisonous.

I don't believe it.

112

I am a realist.

But don't you think that all
these add up together?

114

It must have something going on.

Not just that, Sister.

Since you are going to be

why don't you give it a try?

No way.

Your sister is a girl.

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
do that...

Look properly.

130

I will put this duck intestine into
the big pot now.

131

If I can pick it up in one shot later,

132
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,200
it means that destiny is real.

133
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,320
Then, I'm sorry, Sister.

134

You will have to do it for
Sister Xiao Rou and me

Stop talking nonsense.

141

It is just that the hotpot shop
had no ventilation,

142

and caused carbon monoxide poisoning.

143
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,440
There was no one at home...

144
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,200
yet the house can burn by itself.

145

I would have done that.

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,910
Kiss quickly.

173
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,320
Maybe our fate will change.

174
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,320
I have signed up for you already.

175
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,760
Tian Tian.

176
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,550
To express my sincerity,

177
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,000
I will use up my savings...

178
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,840
to arrange a car for you.

179
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,670
Tian Tian.

180
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,230
I won't go.

181
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,000
-Sister.
-Tian Tian.

182
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,550
No matter what, I'm not going.

183
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,560
[2020 Liuye Sports University
Ice Hockey Department's entrance exam]

184
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,640
How was your exam 2 days before?

185
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,320
[Kiss speedily.]

186
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,280
[Why don't you kiss speedily?]

187
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,880
Go up and play well later.

188
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,390
-Where are my shoes?
-Here.

189
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,030
It must be secured, don't be like mine.

190
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,230
Classmate, that...

191
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,880
That guy named Wen Bing.

192
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,030
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

193
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,390
Classmate.

194
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,470
Do you know Wen Bing?

195
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,590
The one...

196
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,350
Are you asking him?

197
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,760
He knows nothing.

198
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
You should have asked me.

199
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,910
Wen Bing was the best player of
high school league last year.

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,470
This year, he was admitted into
Liuye Sports University directly.

201
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,960
He doesn't even need to
take the entrance exam.

202
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,320
He is so awesome.

203
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,880
[He didn't come to the exam.]

204
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,960
[It is not my fault then.]

205
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,030
[Must I be so unlucky?]

206
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,590
Next group.

207
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,350
So cool.

208
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Coach Ma.

209
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,350
You're here.

210
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,030
[His face changes so fast.]

211
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,150
[What a white lotus.]

212
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,320
[Shoulder width, height,
arm length.]

213
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,160
[Shoulder width.]

214
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,720
[Shoe size.]

215
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,060
[Shoulder width, height,
arm length.]

216
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,320
[Watch on the left hand]

217
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,360
[Height, shoulder width.]

218
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,160
[Identity confirmed, it's Coach Ma]

219
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,350
Wen Bing.

220
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,910
He is the recommended student of the year.

221
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,710
I asked him to observe
everyone's performance.

222
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,910
No.

223
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,590
I'm here to learn with all of you.

224
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,960
Hypocritical.

225
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Fake.

226
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,350
Exaggerating.

227
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,590
Do you know that?

228
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,280
He is the recommended student
for this year.

229
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,470
I see.

230
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,960
I heard that he was the best player
of the high school league last year.

231
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,710
Is it?

232
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,550
Such a fake smirk.

233
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,320
Can't you guys see it?

234
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,230
So, you're Wen Bing.

235
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,880
Hello, and you are?

236
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,590
Shen Wei Lian.

237
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,590
What's up?

238
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,840
I don't know how did you
get the recommendation...

239
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,790
but I watched your game on video.

240
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,910
It's so normal.

241
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,400
Do well on the exam later.

242
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,030
I look forward to your performance.

243
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,880
Do you dare to go on a battle?

244
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,109
Next, Shen Wei Lian.

245
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,560
Got it.

246
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,359
Let's go.

247
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,310
Here's a puck for you.

248
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,109
Okay.

249
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,310
[Didn't the coach asked him
to observe the exam?]

250
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,310
[Why is he here?]

251
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,710
What a coincidence.
We meet again.

252
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,470
He provoked you just now.

253
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,920
Don't you want to battle him?

254
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,560
You're such a coward.

255
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,600
It's better than someone who's here...

256
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,430
but just hiding in the corner
and not taking the exam.

257
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,470
You are no better.

258
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,500
But...

259
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,040
My expression management
is certainly inferior to you.

260
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,110
How did you ...

261
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,470
change your face from
expressionless...

262
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,520
to a cheerful look like
a puppy?

263
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,230
Perhaps you should learn about acting.

264
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,160
You might get an Oscar or whatever

265
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,530
You care so much about me.

266
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,810
Are you falling for me?

267
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Why do you treat others so gently,

268
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,040
but show your true self towards me?

269
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,680
Can't you act more?

270
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,160
Because acting is tiring.

271
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,280
White lotus.

272
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,760
Next.

273
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,270
Next.

274
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,560
[It's so strange.]

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,920
[Why is he the only one
whom I can see clearly?]

276
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,190
[Why is he staring at me so much?]

277
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,640
[Is he a pervert?]

278
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,040
[Why is he still looking at me?]

279
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
[If you still do that,
I will kiss you.]

280
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,470
Next, go on.

281
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,160
[What should I do?
There is no time left.]

282
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,110
[It’s just a kiss.]

283
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
[No matter if my luck changes,]

284
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,470
[I will not see this guy again anyway.]

285
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,600
[One.]

286
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,990
[Two.]

287
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,110
[Three.]

288
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,990
[Do it.]

289
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Everyone is doing well.

290
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,150
Coach Ma.

291
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Shen Wei Lian...

292
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,640
doubts my qualification to be
a recommended student.

293
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,950
So I would like to have a battle with him.

294
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
Is that fine?

295
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,760
That’s fine with me

296
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,040
How do you want to battle?

297
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
You make the rules.

298
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,400
Aright then, two-on-two.

299
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,680
Just one game.

300
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,840
Let's choose our teammate.

301
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,720
What's your name?

302
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,110
Huang Hao Ran.

303
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
I choose you.

304
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,990
What about you?

305
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,280
I choose...

306
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,270
Him.

307
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,990
You...

308
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,880
Huang Hao Ran is winning for sure.

309
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,800
Put me down.

310
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,570
You just have to stand at the side
and watch.

311
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,020
I just wanted to find someone
to make up the number.

312
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,430
What do you mean?

313
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
How about I help them later?

314
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,560
[The teams are...]

315
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,470
[Wen Bing and Sang Tian in the
blue and white jerseys.]

316
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
[Those wearing the
black and white jerseys are]

317
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,430
[Shen Wei Lian and Huang Hao Ran.]

318
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,560
[Alright, a two-on-two match.]

319
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,800
[It is starting.]

320
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,400
[Both teams are ready
and on a standby.]

321
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,560
[Wen Bing, Shen Wei Lian,
rushed out at the same time ]

322
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,040
[Huang Hao Ran follows closely.]

323
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
[Sang Tian is steady.]

324
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,950
[Wen Bing is in possession of the puck.]

325
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,160
[And he passed by Huang Hao Ran.]

326
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,280
[Shen Wei Lian is catching up.]

327
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,000
[Together with Huang Hao Ran,]

328
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,280
[they formed a wall.]

329
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,350
[They try to lock Wen Bing up.]

330
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,640
[Sang Tian just stands there and watches.]

331
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,160
[What is happening?]

332
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,400
[Wen Bing took the puck
and shook off Huang Hao Ran.]

333
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
[He passed by Shen Wei Lian.]

334
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,280
[He is ready to attack.]

335
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,640
[Can Wen Bing get
the first goal so easily?]

336
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,800
[Goal!]

337
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,430
[Wen Bing won his opponents
all by himself.]

338
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,080
[The game continues.]

339
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,830
[Shen Wei Lian has taken the puck.]

340
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,920
[Wen Bing tries to block his way.]

341
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,710
[Huang Hao Ran follows closely
to protect Shen Wei Lian.]

342
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,520
[Shen Wei Lian and Huang Hao Ran
cooperated with each other perfectly.]

343
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,000
[Shen Wei Lian took the puck,]

344
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,560
[and runs towards the goal post.]

345
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
[Wen Bing shook Huang Hao Ran off
and follows closely.]

346
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,110
[Both of them are so fast.]

347
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,350
[They are almost on a par.]

348
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
[Not bad.]

349
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,350
[He can actually keep up with my speed.]

350
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,040
[Shen Wei Lian is ready to attack.]

351
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,840
[What?]

352
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,400
[Sang Tian appears suddenly.]

353
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,110
[He took the puck from
Shen Wei Lian.]

354
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,800
[Huang Hao Ran manages
to catch up in time.]

355
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,350
[Sang Tian turned his body immediately.]

356
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,760
[Huang Hao Ran misses it
and hits the wall.]

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,590
[Sang Tian controls the puck,
awesome.]

358
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,350
[The puck passed between
Shen Wei Lian's legs.]

359
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,000
[This skill is too provocative.]

360
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,350
[But I like it.]

361
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,400
[Huang Hao Ran and Shen Wei Lian
launched a chase behind him.]

362
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,280
[How will Sang Tian break out from them?]

363
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,640
[He rebounds the puck at the wall.]

364
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,520
[The puck fell right into
Wen Bing's hands]

365
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,070
[Sang Tian is a hidden treasure.]

366
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,830
[When he shows himself,
it is awesome]

367
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,040
[Wen Bing passes the goal post and is
ready to attack.]

368
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,070
[Huang Hao Ran and Shen Wei Lian
tries to intercept.]

369
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,760
[But it's too late,
the chance is slim.]

370
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,830
[Wen Bing is going to shoot.]

371
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,920
[Goal! In this two-on-two match,]

372
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,190
[Wen Bing, Sang Tian are the winners.]

373
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,590
Brother, you are so awesome.

374
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,070
I did it on purpose just now.

375
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,160
If I didn't do it,

376
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,430
when would a best player
like you battle with me?

377
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,310
Now we know each other.

378
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,160
We are brothers now.

379
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,760
His aura is really different.

380
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,000
You're Sang Tian, right?

381
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,430
I didn't expect a small sized person
like you to be so powerful.

382
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,110
Let's exchange contacts later.

383
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,320
Alright.

384
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,430
Remember to add my contact.

385
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,390
You're hungry, right?

386
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,520
-Do you want to eat something?
-10.

387
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,080
-Let's go to the canteen.
-11.

388
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,680
Why did you take so long to change?

389
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,680
Otherwise,

390
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,000
I will go first.

391
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,520
If I go now,

392
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,040
how do I explain to them?

393
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,110
Whatever,

394
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,590
this is the last chance.

395
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,520
Take a breath, and fake a fall.

396
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,160
Run off after the kiss.

397
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,760
Perfect.

398
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,110
What's up?

399
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,710
We know each other now.

400
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,350
Why don't we reconcile?

401
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,830
There should be no conflict
between us, right?

402
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,430
There is no need for that.

403
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,230
See you soon.

404
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,190
[Why would you...]

405
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,040
[treat the others so gently...]

406
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,590
[but show your true self towards me?]

407
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,160
[Can't you act more?]

408
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,680
[Because acting is tiring.]

409
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,990
[Impossible.]

410
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,160
[That dark white lotus.]

411
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,710
[It is definitely not him.]

412
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,920
I can play ice hockey properly again now.

413
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
You need to be happier.

414
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,560
It looks better like this.

415
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,470
Keep smiling every time.

416
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,280
Sang Tian, you're a Koi girl.

417
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,280
You are always luckier than the others.

418
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,560
There is nothing...

419
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,040
more unlucky now than ever.

420
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,160
You can do it.

421
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,710
If you can't make it this year,

422
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,680
you can do it next year.

423
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,190
you can do it

424
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,750
Goodbye.

425
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,760
Good morning.

426
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,680
Good morning.

427
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,950
Uncle Landlord.

428
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,110
Why are you in my house?

429
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,040
Your house?

430
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,110
It's my house.

431
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,760
How did you burn the house?

432
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,760
-What happened?
-Uncle Landlord, I...

433
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,830
It is ridiculous.

434
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,310
Really ridiculous.

435
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,390
Tian Tian.

436
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,480
Are you okay?

437
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,560
The landlord chased you away
just like this?

438
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,880
He is so inconsiderate.

439
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,640
If your house is burnt down like this,

440
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,680
you will be crueler than him.

441
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,830
But I stay in the dorm.

442
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,350
What's your plan now?

443
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,520
Excuse me, is this room 183?

444
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,160
I have a parcel for Sang Tian.

445
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,960
-Tian Tian.
-Sister.

446
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,390
Tian Tian.

447
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,680
-Sister.
-Sign for me.

448
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,680
-Tian Tian.
-I will do it.

449
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,680
Thank you.

450
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,880
What? Liuye Sports University?

451
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,960
[Admission Notice Letter]

452
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
-Qian Bei City.
-Don't move.

453
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,150
What?

454
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,470
Admission Notice.

455
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,160
Admission Notice?

456
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
My luck is back.

457
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,800
I know it.

458
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,590
My sincerity must have touched the coach.

459
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,680
So now I am accepted by the
Figure Skating Department.

460
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,230
Let me see.

461
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,160
I don't have to pay the rent now.

462
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,430
I don't need to pack my things too.

463
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,230
-Help me with moving out.
-Alright.

464
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,310
I'm so happy, I want to dance.

465
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,520
Men's ice hockey club.

466
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,110
Men's ice hockey club.

467
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,000
How could it be?

468
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,840
[Sang Tian, you are admitted to
the men's ice hockey club.]

469
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
A friendly reminder.

470
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,950
Cross-dresser in school,

471
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,710
is a fairy tale in my comics.

472
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,760
In real life,

473
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,040
it is impossible.

474
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,520
Sister, you have a place to stay now.

475
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,520
The dormitory of the mens ice hockey club.

476
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,520
How could you let your sister go to
the men's ice hockey club?

477
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,000
She is a girl.

478
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,830
She has no place to stay anyway.

479
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,760
Why not just insinuated in first?

480
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,520
Then it will be okay.

481
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,750
It is better than...

482
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,070
What kind of bad idea is that?

483
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
-Stop.
-Do you want to die?

484
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,830
-I brought sweets.
-Yes or no?

485
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,110
-It makes sense.
-Let's eat.

486
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,110
Relax.

487
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,320
Put down your hand.

488
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,480
Tian Tian.

489
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,160
You have always wanted
to go to Liuye right?

490
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,310
Although this mens ice hockey club...

491
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,760
is a little different...

492
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,190
from the figure skating club.

493
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,640
But it is Liuye.

494
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,280
You have fulfilled your dream.

495
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,920
My milk tea shop is also at Liuye.

496
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,110
We can take care of each other too.

497
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,430
Fang Xiao Rou.

498
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,760
How could you change so fast?

499
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,110
I don't want to go to the
ice hockey club.

500
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,880
What are you looking for?

501
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,070
I was tidying it up the whole day.

502
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,230
What are you doing?

503
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,400
Got it.

504
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,160
