[Oh my gosh! It's a sign
of falling in love]

5
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,420
A weak wrist is not your main problem.

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,340
But you'll have to train it.

7
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,460
Next is your shooting posture.

8
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,789
Here.

9
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,780
Shooting posture.

10
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,030
Hold it well.

11
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,020
Keep this part firm.

[Sang Tian, why are you so shy?]

13
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,100
[This is purely instructional.]

[Stay focused.]

15
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,540
Aim exactly where you're shooting.
Understand?

16
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,820
When you shoot, aim with your eyes.
Understand?

17
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,980
Keep practicing.

18
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,340
[It's a pity he's so good-looking...]

19
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,060

21
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,740

Brother Wen Bing.

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,580
Yes, Meng Na?

24
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,420
I have two tickets to a musical.

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,860
Let's go together this weekend
if you're available.

26
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,780
Sorry, I have a three-on-three challenge
next week.

27
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,460
I won't have time as I have to practice.

28
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,820
What about Monday night?

29
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,980
I have practice on Monday, too.

30
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,220
Okay then.

31
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,180
Why don't I visit you guys...

32
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,860
with some refreshments and root for you?

33
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,980
You don't have to.

34
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,420
Coach wouldn't be happy if she sees you.

35
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,340
I have to return to practice

36
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,220
-See you.
-Brother Wen Bing!

37
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,100
Come in.

38
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,500
Coach Ma.

39
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,579
Hello.

40
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,579
Why are you here?

41
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,460
Your room is quite big.

42
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,940
I'm here to pay you back the money.

43
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,340
You don't know my phone number?

44
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,780
You can transfer it to me.

45
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,500
How can I do that?

46
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,540
It's not sincere.

47
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,460
It's better for me to come personally.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
By the way,

49
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,180
here's a little present.

50
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,180
Your little present...

51
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,300
is indeed... small.

52
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,540
You're really on point.

53
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,820
This present is small.

54
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,620
Its petite size allows you to place it
in your purse, your pocket,

55
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,340
anywhere you want.

56
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,300
Besides, it smells...

57
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,620
like verbena.

58
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,300
It suits your personality.

59
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,540
I can't accept this.

60
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,700
Save it for your own use.

61
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,620
Of course you can.

62
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,780
You helped me recover
my bag the last time.

63
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,020
You're my benefactor!

64
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,900
Am I right?

65
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,180
So, you must accept the present.

66
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,140
If not...

67
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,620
If not,

68
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,540
I'll be punished for not repaying my debt.

69
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,780
So the bag is already with you.

70
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,420
It's like this, Coach Ma.

71
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,380
I'm here today to offer you
a sincere apology.

72
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,660
It hurts me for you to say that.

73
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,140
Okay, fine. I'll accept it.

74
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,460
Okay? Thanks.

75
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,660
I think you have misunderstood
me greatly.

76
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,580
Why don't we get to know
each other better?

77
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,300
Sorry, but I'm busy.

78
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,780
It's okay, I'm free.

79
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,580
If you want to know someone,

80
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,740
go to Coach Xue next door.

81
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
You two can get to know each other.

82
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,860
But I want to know more about you.

83
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,700
Please leave.

84
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,020
-Let's chat.
-You're not leaving?

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,980
I'll leave.

86
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,100
My job is yours.

87
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,540
-Thanks.
-Please don't!

88
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,860
I'll leave. I'll leave...

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,980
Let's have lunch sometime.

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,700
My treat.

91
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,780
It does suit my personality.

92
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,620
Good day, Miss.

93
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,540
Is that all you're having for lunch?

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,860
I've gone back to 45 kilograms.

95
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,460
Now I'm on a diet .

96
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,340
How I envy you, Senior.

97
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,220
It's okay for your ice hockey players
to get fat.

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,820
Not like figure skaters.

99
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,860
Heaven is looking upon us.

100
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,659
We might not be able to lift ourselves up
if we're not careful.

101
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Senior.

102
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,540
Do you notice any difference
in my makeup today?

103
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,660
Is something wrong with your eyes?

104
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,340
Looks the same to me.

105
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,580
How is it the same?

106
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,700
I'm wearing the latest and greatest...

107
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,660
men-tempting floral makeup.

108
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,500
Senior, forgive me for being blunt.

109
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,020
Although you spend your days around boys,

110
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,060
you're still a woman.

111
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,460
Sometimes, it is necessary...

112
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,620
to take care of your skin.

113
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,460
By the way,

114
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,460
Cheng Min Jun gave me a set of cosmetics
two days ago.

115
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,659
I'll recommend it to you
if it's nice on me.

116
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,180
It's called...

117
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,860
It's called...

118
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,860
Let me see.

119
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,140
Cheng Min Jun.

120
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,580
I've found it.

[Complimentary]

122
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,060
There's a free hand cream in this set.

123
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,500
Why didn't I get one?

124
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,500
How strange.

125
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,020
Where did it go?

126
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,100
Isn't this the hand cream?

127
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,780
Where did you get this?

128
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,660
My God!

129
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,340
He fooled you with a free hand cream!

130
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,340
How absurd of him!

131
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,860
I'm mad for you!

132
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,860
What kind of person is that?

133
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,059
I'm not surprised.

134
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,900
That's his behaviour.

135
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,460
You're leaving?

136
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,020
Your free gift, Senior!

137
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,700
Who is it?

138
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,180
What's the matter?

139
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,100
Wipe your sweat.

140
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,660
Thanks.

141
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
I just used it.

142
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,380
We're all boys.

143
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,540
What's wrong with it?

144
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,220
You're right.

145
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,780
Your milk teas are here.

146
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
Please give us a 5-star rating.

147
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,700
You ordered them?

148
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,540
I paid for them.

149
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,860
Thanks.

150
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,300
You're welcome! Got to go!

151
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,820
Why are you working as a delivery boy...

152
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,620
instead of studying at Shuren?

153
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,940
Is this how you repay your brother
for putting you through school?

154
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900
I have no class this afternoon.

155
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,660
So I came to help Xiao Rou.

156
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,740
I'm leaving, please continue.

157
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,380
-Keep it up, brother.
-Go!

158
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,740
Keep up the good work!

159
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,060
Have a milk tea.

160
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,900
I don't take sweet drinks.

161
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,040
Where are you going?

162
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,340
That's enough practice.
Let's continue tomorrow.

163
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,780
Fine, more for me.

164
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,660
[Come to the shop now.
The three of us need to talk.]

165
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,860
Impossible!

166
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,180
If he's face-blind,

167
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,140
how could he recognize me straight away?

168
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,580
But it's all there on the medical report
in black and white.

169
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,820
A trap!

170
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,460
Yes, it's definitely a trap.

171
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,300
Why would he pretend to be face-blind?
It doesn't make sense.

172
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,220
Why not?

173
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,140
He wants you to stay.

174
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,220
I don't agree with Sang Zhan.

175
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,340
Though face-blind patients
can't recognize faces,

176
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,580
they can recognize people.

177
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,740
Think about it.

178
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,340
Hairstyles, clothing, shoe sizes.

179
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
Even catchphrases...

180
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,740
and footsteps are distinctive.

181
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,380
Even a blind man could tell,

182
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,380
let alone a face-blind person.

183
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,300
Right?

184
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,660
It makes sense, I guess.

185
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,060
I know!

186
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,540
What do you know?

187
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,020
I know how he could tell so easily.

188
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,060
Why?

189
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,580
Didn't my sister got locked in the
equipment room that day?

190
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,900
I couldn't find you anywhere.

191
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,740
Finally, Wen Bing took me to the
surveillance room.

192
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,620
[Stop! Zoom in!]

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,860
You lied about saving your sister.

194
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,860
That's not the point.

195
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,020
The point is, he can only see you.

196
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,540
Otherwise, how could he have
spotted you...

197
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,500
with just a quick glance?

198
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,420
That's so sweet, Tian Tian.

199
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,660
You're the only one in his world.

200
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,260
♫ I say I only have eyes for you. ♫

201
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,460
-Sister Xiao Rou.
-Stop that!

202
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,580
I say, you should change your play list.

203
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,380
Then again,

204
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,540
I feel rather sorry for him.

205
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
Face-blindness...

206
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,180
definitely affects him on the ice rink.

207
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,740
Unless...

208
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,660
he makes a mark or something.

209
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,740
Mark?

210
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,380
Like this?

211
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,060
Less ice, 30 less sugar.

212
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,460
That's it!

213
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,500
What is it?

214
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,140
Less ice, 30 % less sugar.

215
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,140
You're back.

216
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,140
Why not get some rest
instead of wasting time?

217
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,560
I...

218
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,700
[Talking to a girl like that.]

219
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,420
[Serves you right, you loner.]

220
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,060
Draw if you please.

221
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,860
But don't stay up too late.

222
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,540
We have practice in the morning.

223
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,580
Draw if you want.

224
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,180
But don't stay up too late.

225
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,060
We have to practice in the morning.

226
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,020
[When did he become so gentle?]

227
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,860
[I'm not used to that.]

228
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,540
Hit this.

229
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,060
How can I hit that?

230
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,780
You won't know unless you try.

231
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,940
I can't even if I try.

232
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Let me try.

233
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,420
Move aside.

234
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,900
Almost.

235
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,740
I told you it's impossible.

236
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,220
Why are you so quiet?

237
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,660
Feeling guilty?

238
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,660
You practiced behind my back.

239
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,900
You call yourself a brother?

240
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,860
Less talk, more practice.

241
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,380
Coach Ma specifically said
your handling is poor.

242
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,300
You'd better not drag us down
when it comes to the crunch.

243
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,980
Coach Ma even ordered you...

244
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,500
to practise passing with anyone
except Sang Tian.

245
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,380
That's me, right?

246
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,700
I'm available today.

247
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,380
I'll practice with you.

248
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,140
My hands slipped.

250
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,460
What are you doing?

251
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,580
What do you mean?

252
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,020
Isn't it normal to have accidents
during training?

253
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,180
Why don't you guys move along?

254
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,060
Why should we?

255
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,180
Look at your puny limbs.

256
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,220
Don't blame me if you get injured.

257
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,260
I'll show you.

258
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,620
Senior's right.

259
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,660
But there's an unspoken rule in Liuye.

260
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,500
The strong shall conquer the ice rink.

261
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,900
What?

262
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,460
You want a match?

263
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,580
What? Are you afraid?

264
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Me? Afraid?

265
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,300
Bring it on. Name the game.

266
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,540
The plastic bottle in Sang Tian's hand.

267
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,100
Sure. Best out of one.

268
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,940
He'll miss it.

269
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,300
I said hit the bottle, not the bottle cap.

270
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,020
It doesn't count. Let's go again.

271
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Senior.

272
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,100
You said it's a best out of one.

273
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,580
-Are you trying to back out?
-Yeah.

274
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,460
Wei Lian.

275
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,940
He's our senior.

276
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,740
If he wants to warm-up,

277
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,860
we can wait for him.

278
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,860
When he's done, we'll have a rematch.

279
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,020
What do you mean?

280
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,140
Yan Wu Xu, what are you doing?

281
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,700
Na Na.

282
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,260
Where's my brother?

283
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Your brother left with Coach Ma
a while ago.

284
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,100
Does that mean you can do
whatever you want?

285
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,780
No, this is a misunderstanding.

286
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,260
A misunderstanding?

287
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,940
I saw it with my own eyes.

288
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,260
You were showing off.

289
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,460
Now you're playing dumb?

290
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Aren't you ashamed?

291
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,099
-I...
-Leave now!

292
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,540
They have a match next week.

293
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,500
We have a match next week, too.

294
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,859
Are you leaving or not?

295
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,220
One.

296
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,230
Come on...

297
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,619
-Two.
-Let's go...

298
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,460
Keep on going, Brother Wen Bing.

299
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,500
I'll stand there and watch. Keep it up.

300
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,980
Come on, let's practice.

301
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,180
He's so handsome.

302
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,060
Brother Wen Bing.

303
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,620
Let me wipe your sweat.

304
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,540
It's okay.

305
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,140
Sang Tian.

306
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,420
Are you okay?

307
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,980
-I'm fine.
-Be careful.

308
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,060
Why don't you go back?

309
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
It's okay, keep practicing.

310
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,980
I'll stay here and watch. Don't mind me.

311
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,140
Alright.

312
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
You stay here.

313
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,660
I'll get drinks.

314
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,500
I'll get drinks, too.

315
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,860
You guys keep it up.

316
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,540
Sang Tian. Sang Tian.

317
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,060
What are you looking at?

318
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Can you focus?

319
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,220
We're going after champion.

320
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,620
Okay, let's continue.

321
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,500
I'll practice shooting.

322
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,540
Okay, good luck!

323
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,940
Don't be mad.

324
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,220
She's the captain's sister, his gem.

325
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,740
We can't afford to offend her.

326
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,060
You're right.

327
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,340
But didn't you see?

328
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,220
She's clearly siding with Wen Bing.

329
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,100
Captain.

330
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,460
-Captain.
-Where's my sister?

331
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,780
At the ice rink with Wen Bing.

332
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,460
Brother Wen Bing.

333
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,260
Let's get drinks.

334
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,260
Stay away from my sister.
Do you understand?

335
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,180
That's no way to talk!

336
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,980
How can you accuse him like that?

337
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,940
But he has  desires on you!

338
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,540
Are you crazy?

339
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,140
Brother Wen Bing.

340
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,500
Don't mind him. Let's go.

341
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,340
Na Na! Na Na!

342
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,580
Can't he bring his own drinks?

343
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,780
Always buying drinks.

344
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,020
What's up with that?

345
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,940
It's not the drinks.

346
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,660
He's just mesmerized by her looks.

347
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,740
They've been gone for ages.

348
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,980
That lecher.

349
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,540
Big lecher! Scoundrel!

350
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,700
Fool!

351
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,220
You're very focused, Sang Tian.

352
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,100
But your posture could use work.

353
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,660
Keep your core low.

354
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,540
Lower.

355
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,340
Sway side to side when hitting the puck.

356
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,740
Push the stick down when
you swing, like this.

357
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,060
-Lower my core...
-That's right.

358
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,460
Like this?

359
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,180
Like this.

360
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,740
Hold the stick higher,

361
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,980
and apply downward pressure.

362
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,380
Your hand, arm...

363
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,460
and shoulder... must be aligned.

364
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,580
Hand, arm and shoulder...

365
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,820
must be aligned.

366
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,460
Pull up the stick.

367
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,700
Like this?

368
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,980
Wei Lian?

369
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,980
Yes.

370
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,060
I'll get drinks.

371
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,300
You keep practicing

372
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,540
Why does my heart beat so fast when I'm with her?

373
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,740
Which would you like, Brother Wen Bing?

374
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,260
This... or this?

375
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,140
Anything.

376
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,620
Then I'll choose.

377
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,340
The white one is more your taste.

378
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,460
I'll have the green one.

379
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,980
Bill, please.

380
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,580
Do I scan here?

381
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,460
Yes.

382
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,420
-Done.
-Thanks.

383
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,180
No problem. Please come again.

384
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
[Why would he sneak pictures of her?]

385
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,940
[And with such a corny gesture.]

386
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,060
Why are you sneaking pictures?

387
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,340
Who uses such a corny gesture?

388
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,700
Sang Tian, help me take a photo
with Brother Wen Bing.

389
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,140
Sang Tian?

390
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,020
Sang Tian!

391
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,780
[How did she recognize me?]

392
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,500
Pull it down.

393
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,220
Me?

394
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
What a coincidence.

395
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,500
Come here, Brother Wen Bing.

396
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,500
[I've never taken a picture with him.]

397
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,980
Come, strike a pose.

398
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
Is this angle okay?

399
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,900
Squeeze together.

400
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,900
Closer.

401
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,620
Just a tiny bit more...

402
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,540
A little closer.

403
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,780
Wen Bing, what's wrong
with your face?

404
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,780
Is it numb?

405
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,740
Your eyes are too tense. Relax.

406
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,660
Here, say cheese!

407
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,580
Cheese!

408
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,820
Good! It's done.

409
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,860
Thank you.

410
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,820
It looks great!

411
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,700
Sang Tian, why don't you
join us for lunch?

412
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,260
There's a cafe next to campus
that's all the rage.

413
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,420
It's okay. I have practice.

414
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,500
He's not jealous of us, is he?

415
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,220
Oh God. Is he still in love with me?

416
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Maybe.

417
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,700
So don't come to our practice anymore.

418
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,660
Lest he gets distracted.

419
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,500
Brother Wen Bing!

420
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,940
Miao Miao!

421
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,540
Miao Miao!

422
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,100
Miao Miao!

423
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,860
I've called you multiple times.

424
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,420
You should call me Senior.

425
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
I don't want to.

426
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,940
I've never called you my sister.

427
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,740
Now that I'm in university,

428
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,060
it's even more unlikely.

429
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,740
What's wrong?

430
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,660
You look troubled.

431
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,580
Nothing.

432
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,140
We grew up together.

433
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,460
You can tell me anything.

434
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,180
If... I mean if...

435
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,540
I meet someone...

436
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,540
and it makes my heart beat wildly.

437
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,820
Thud, thud, thud.

438
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,340
Like it's going to explode.

439
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,540
What does it mean?

440
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,140
A man or a woman?

441
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,340
Is there any difference?

442
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,580
Of course there is.

443
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,700
If it's a woman,

444
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,140
it means you're in love.

445
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,020
But if it's a man...

446
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,300
it means he's so outstanding...

447
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,780
that you're intimidated.

448
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,100
Like your older brother.

449
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,820
Why do you mention him every time?

450
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,580
I have no such brother.

451
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,020
You're still immature.

452
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,860
Why are you leaving?

453
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,140
You're fooling me, right?

454
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,700
You said you'd teach me properly.

455
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,060
But you went out on a date instead.

456
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,180
Fixed!

457
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Why isn't he back yet?

458
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,100
Never mind. Since I can't sleep,

459
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,820
why don't I practise at the ice rink?

460
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,180
Didn't you go out with Meng Na?

461
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,340
How could I?

462
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,740
I barely have time to practise
except at night.

463
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,700
I'll practise with you at night.

464
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,580
No.

465
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,220
Coach Ma specifically told me
to practise passing...

466
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,860
with anyone but you.

467
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,620
Let's play a game.

468
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,220
What kind of game?

469
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,740
You get ten pucks.

470
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,460
If you can score six times,

471
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,140
I'll give you a prize.

472
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,340
What kind of prize? A single room?

473
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,700
You wish.

474
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,260
Are you scared?

475
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,940
Of course! I'm not scared

476
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,300
Serve.

477
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,140
Only three pucks left.

478
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,980
You need to score two more times
to win the prize.

479
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,980
Nice work. Keep going.

480
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,980
I win!

481
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,020
My prize.

482
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,340
Come on, I want my prize.

483
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Why give me a picture of Meng Na's feet?

484
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,900
Didn't I tell you I don't like her?

485
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,060
Look closely.

486
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,100
What's there to see?

487
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,980
Just look.

488
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,180
[Why would he sneak pictures of her?]

489
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,220
[And with such a corny gesture.]

490
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,880
Why would you take such photos?

491
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
It's so childish.

492
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,380
You said we've never taken
a picture together.

493
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
So here it is.

494
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,780
What kind of group photo is this?

495
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,060
Why must you have one?

496
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,980
It's not like you're leaving Liuye.

497
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,940
How did you know?

498
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,580
You saw the letter I wrote you?

499
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
I'm warning you.

500
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,460
I don't care for being the class monitor.

501
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,380
So you'd better play your heart out
and keep the trophy.

502
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,260
Got it?

503
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,140
Now that we've locked pinkies,
you'd better keep your promise.

504
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,780
One more thing.

505
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,660
I've been observing your
posture, angle and strength.

506
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,060
You've improved quite a lot.

507
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,540
But you lack something called faith.

508
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,660
Faith?

509
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,580
Yes.

510
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,100
You must focus not only on your puck
and your stick.

511
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,180
You must aim for your target
and have the faith to score.

512
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,140
I heard you have a crush?

513
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,140
Picture her between the goal posts.

514
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,340
Strike her heart with all your might.

515
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,260
Try it.

516
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,700
Wait, I have a question.

517
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,420
Who does an ace scorer like you...

518
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,140
picture between those goal posts?

519
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,980
Myself.

520
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,020
Narcissist.

521
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,260
Hurry and practise.
Don't you want to sleep?

522
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,180
Alright.

523
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,820
So handsome.

524
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,700
[Sad Little Child, are you sad
these days?]

525
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,900
[Nope.]

526
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,700
[I'm so happy today.]

527
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,620
[What happened? Mind to share?]

528
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,740
[I took your advice...]

529
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,580
[and become his quiet guardian angel.]

530
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,740
[Guess what happened?]

531
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,300
[He snuck pictures of me
when I wasn't looking.]

532
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,380
[He must've fallen for me.]

533
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,020
[With guidance from me,
Kidney Impaired God,]

534
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,780
[you can win any guy's heart.]

535
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,660
[Right! We even took our first photo
together.]

536
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,900
[We make such a cute couple!]

537
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,460
[Show me, please.]

538
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,980
[Show me, please.]

539
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
[No way. Didn't we agree...]

540
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,540
[to remain as friendly strangers?]

541
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,340
[Only by staying anonymous...]

542
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,860
[can we share our secrets
without inhibitions.]

543
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,380
[Fine.]

544
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,139
[Don't you want to know
what I look like?]

545
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,060
[What if I'm hotter than Daniel Wu
or Mr. Kaneshiro?]

546
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,739
[I don't want to know.]

547
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,620
[No one is hotter than him.]

548
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,980
[I should change my alias.]

549
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,460
[To Sad.]

550
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,980
[Okay, fine.]

551
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,900
[Seeing that you've helped me,]

552
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,100
[let's have some fun.]

553
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,460
[Come on!]

554
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,580
You're getting better.

555
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,860
Why did you come so early?

556
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,900
You're so diligent.

557
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,020
I can't lose to you.

558
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,540
This is...

559
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,980
Don't misunderstand.

560
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,300
I think of it as the people that I hate.

561
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,300
I didn't say you like me.
Why are you nervous?

562
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,940
Which eye of yours saw that?

563
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,940
Why is your face all red, then?

564
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,060
It's not.

565
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,220
Do you dare look into my eyes...

566
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
and say it again?

567
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,740
I...

568
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,540
Why stutter? Keep practicing.

569
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,820
Get dribbling.

570
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,540
It's not fair.

571
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,340
I hit a bottle, but you hit my head.

572
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,110
[Liuye Sports University]

573
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,540
-Get me my clothes.
-Okay.

574
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,220
Inform the others.

575
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,260
We're having a three-on-three
this Saturday at 3 p.m.

576
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,780
I'll see you there. Don't be late.

577
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,700
Coach Ma, I have a question.

578
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,940
Can we request for anything
if we beat the seniors?

579
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,780
I want a signed photograph of Chen Yao.

580
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,900
I want a live husky.

581
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,220
-I want...
-He wants Guan Hong's signed photo.

582
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,100
I want a washing machine.

583
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,660
Like I said...

584
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,220
Any request at all.

585
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,820
-Do you like Chen Yao that much?
-You bet. I'm obsessed.

586
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,740
Sit down.

587
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,100
What do you want, Sang Tian?

588
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,300
I...

589
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,820
You'll know when we win.

590
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,420
You're right.

591
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,620
So we must win this game.

592
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,260
I have an idea.

593
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,860
In order to build chemistry
among us three,

594
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,060
and to match my schedule with yours.

595
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,020
So I've decided to let out my single room.

596
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,900
Starting tonight,

597
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,660
I'll stay with you guys.

598
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,460
-No way.
-No way.

599
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,940
I think it's a good idea.

600
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,820
Didn't you eat? Run faster!

601
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,660
The parachute is not even flying!

602
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,140
Faster, faster, faster!

603
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,580
Look alive!

604
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,900
Remember the shooting posture
I taught you?

605
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,180
Lower your core.

606
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,460
Morning.

607
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,140
Morning!

608
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,220
What are you doing this early?

609
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,980
Afternoon's the match.

610
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,580
Shouldn't we get up early
and start practising?

611
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,660
Practice for what?

612
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,620
The match isn't until noon.
You should relax now.

613
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,740
What if you hurt yourself before then?

614
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,140
That makes sense.

615
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,220
So, how should we relax?

616
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,820
I have my ways.

617
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,780
What about me?

618
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,860
How would I know?

619
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,300
What?

620
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,500
Hello? Xiao Rou.

621
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,540
What? Go to a roadshow with you?

622
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
I...

623
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,020
Alright. I've nothing to
do in the morning anyway.

624
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,900
Wait for me.

625
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,340
Don't disturb me.

626
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,020
What is it? Is something bothering you?

627
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,380
Who says I'm bothered?

628
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,020
Whenever you're depressed,

629
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,620
you'd tear and throw...

630
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
and throw and tear.

631
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,060
What did the paper ever do to you?

632
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,020
Are you worried Sang Tian
might leave you if you lose?

633
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,420
We'll win for sure.

634
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,020
Okay, fine.

635
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,660
Of course I hope you'll win.

636
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,180
As long as Sang Tian stays,

637
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,740
there's hope for your eyes.

638
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,820
Didn't you hear what Dr. Smith said?

639
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,620
You must get close to her.
The closer the better.

640
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,540
The more...

641
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,180
What's wrong?

642
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,620
Where are you going?

643
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,420
My poor nephew.

644
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,980
How can I help him?

645
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,460
Poor thing.

646
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,860
Coach Ma!

647
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,140
If she's in a good mood,

648
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,300
she'll let Sang Tian stay...

649
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,420
even if they lose.

650
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,140
Xiao Rou?

651
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,500
What style is this?

652
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,820
What do you know?

653
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,540
This is called retro-chic.

654
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,820
Ever heard of the disco queen?

655
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,700
Do you expect me to dress like this, too?

656
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,420
Why not?

657
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,860
The theme for the roadshow today is...

658
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,530
Disco Madness!

659
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,580
I'll consider it.

660
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,140
What do you need to consider ?

661
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,100
You promised me, Tian Tian.

662
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,220
Besides, your match is at 3 p.m.

663
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,140
This will be over by 11 a.m.

664
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,180
I wouldn't have asked you
if I hadn't gotten stood up.

665
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,620
Alright.

666
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,390
Just to be clear, I've never rehearsed.

667
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,940
If I make any mistakes, don't blame me.

668
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,620
Why would our former figure skating queen
make mistakes?

669
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,820
A few simple disco moves should be
no challenge.

670
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,940
Go get changed.

671
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,660
I'll teach you when you're done.

672
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,820
It'll be a cinch.

673
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,360
Why are you so over-confident...

674
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,660
-Let's go!
-like that jerk?
