Of all people, how dare you
provoke our captain.

22
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,470
Isn’t doing such a thing too much?

23
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,310
What's wrong with it?

24
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,710
We need to teach them a lesson.
Otherwise, they won't remember it.

25
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,110
And, who is Wen Bing?

26
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,910
He is the playboy who provokes
the younger sister of our captain.

27
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,870
And that Sang Tian,

28
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,070
he is so close to Senior Miao Miao.

29
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,750
He didn't ask about
the relationship...

30
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,590
between Senior Miao Miao
and our captain before he comes here.

And also that...

Shen Wei Lian.
I feel disturbed whenever I see him.

33
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,550
He is naive.

34
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,480
But, Coach Ma wants us to
notify everyone...

35
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,460
that the match has
been changed to 11 a.m.

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,910
If we didn't notify the 3 of them,

37
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,310
the coach will find out
and the blame will be on us.

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,510
If we say nothing, who would know,
right?

39
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,020
There are more than 30 persons,
so it's normal to miss one or two of them.

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,830
If they ask, just say that
we don't have their contact.

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,230
And I think that as  classmates,
they will notify each other.

42
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,590
So I know how to deal with the coach.

43
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,829
-There is no need to worry about this.
-Both of you are so mean.

44
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,670
I'm going to tell Coach Ma now.

45

-Don't.
-Let go of your hand.

Goodbye.

163
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,220
Goodbye.

164
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,510
Hurry, go on.

165
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,270
-Coach.
-Hurry.

166
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,620
-Coach.
-Coach.

167
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Coach.

168
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,900
Coach.

169
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,460
Let's eat something first.

170
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,790
Why haven’t Brother Wen Bing
reached yet?

171
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,060
Brother, can the game time
be delayed a bit?

172
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,260
Wen Bing hasn’t reached yet.

173
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,510
We have notified everyone that
the time has changed.

174
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,500
You will be disqualified if
you are absent.

175
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,580
This is the rule.

176
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,740
The rule is fixed,
but people are flexible.

177
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,230
Aren't you the captain
of the school team?

178
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,270
Help me plead to Coach Ma, please.

179
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,670
Na Na, it's useless for anyone to plead.

180
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,630
Maybe, Wen Bing's delay is intentional.

181
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,020
-Maybe he's scared.
-You say it again.

182
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
What are you talking about?

183
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,940
I wonder who is the scared one.

184
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,510
The match has changed time.

185
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,420
But no one notified me, Wen Bing,
and Sang Tian on purpose.

186
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,700
And locked me in the toilet.

187
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,260
Luckily the cleaners helped me
open the door.

188
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,660
-Where is Wen Bing now?
-He hasn't reached yet?

189
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,700
I notified him before
my phone was taken away.

190
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,820
Where is my phone?

191
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,420
-What are you talking about?
-Where is my phone?

192
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,940
I will deal with you later.

193
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,620
Meng Qi, let me tell you.

194
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,390
If Brother Wen Bing is late
because of your trick,

195
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,030
I won't forgive you forever.

196
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,750
What? Na Na.
I don't even know about this.

197
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,950
I don't want to listen to your excuse.

198
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,910
You better pray that
Brother Wen Bing won't be late.

199
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,500
Na Na.

200
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,300
-Why are they not here yet?
-Yeah.

201
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,780
Why are they not here yet?

202
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,710
-Where are they?
-Well...

203
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,580
Coach.

204
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,020
Wen Bing and Sang Tian
haven't reached yet.

205
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,460
Can the game be delayed a bit?

206
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,790
-Coach, let's wait for them.
-Coach, let's wait for them.

207
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,980
Just wait a while.

208
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,660
Begging me won't do any help.

209
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,340
What if this is the Winter Olympic Games?

210
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,700
Wei Lian.

211
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,230
You're finally here.

212
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,220
I thought I got stood up again.

213
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,870
No worries about that. Just get ready to
set off the firecrackers after the game.

214
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,240
Yours.

215
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,260
What.

216
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,470
What is this?

217
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,260
This is our unique mark, the iron trio.

218
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,140
Let's do our best.

219
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,190
We must win.

220
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,900
I repeat the rules of 3 on 3.

221
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,580
There is only 1 game.

222
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,980
20 minutes for the game.

223
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,700
Will the game be extended
if it is a draw?

224
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,980
If it is a draw,

225
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,980
you will win.

226
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,670
Great.

227
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,300
Seniors have showed
their kindness.

228
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,460
Do you have any objections?

229
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,070
Of course not.

230
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,460
Then, the game starts now.

231
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,700
[The players are,
Team Freshman, Wen Bing.]

232
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,860
[Team Senior, Meng Qi.]

233
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,420
[Team Freshmen, Shen Wei Lian.]

234
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
[Team Senior, Chong Kai Wen.]

235
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,500
[Team Freshman, Sang Tian.]

236
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,700
[Team Senior, Huang Zhi Lie.]

237
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,380
[Game starts, the referee is kicking off.]

238
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,380
[Wen Bing takes the lead
as he took the puck from Meng Qi.]

239
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,390
[He passed through the defense made
by Chong Kai Wen and Huang Zhi Lie.]

240
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,340
[He runs directly to the goal post.]

241
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,060
[Huang Zhi Lie chases him closely.]

242
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,180
[Wen Bing makes a turn and
leaves Huang Zhi Lie.]

243
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,780
Brother Wen Bing, fighting.
Brother Wen Bing, fighting.

244
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,980
[Meng Qi suddenly makes
a fierce attack.]

245
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,860
[Like the Mars hit on the Earth,
he hits Wen Bing onto the boundary wall.]

246
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,150
Foul. How could he
hit people like this?

247
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,780
[Meng Qi catches up.]

248
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,060
[With his superior skills to control
the puck, he passed Shen Wei Lian.]

249
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,260
[Nice.]

250
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,300
[He passed by the agile Sang Tian.]

251
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,740
[Sang Tian tries to block the ball.]

252
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,950
[Interception failed.]

253
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,099
[Meng Qi runs to the goal.
Ready to shoot.]

254
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,819
[Goal scored. Meng Qi takes
the first point for Team Senior.]

255
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,339
[They are on the lead
with one to zero score.]

256
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,260
[The game continues.]

257
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,470
[Wen Bing of Team Freshman and
Meng Qi of Team Senior will kick off.]

258
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,900
[Wen Bing gets the puck and
passes it to Sang Tian.]

259
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,980
[Sang Tian passes it
to Shen Wei Lian.]

260
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,190
[Shen Wei Lian passes the ball
to Wen Bing.]

261
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,510
[It seems like Team Freshman
has great teamwork.]

262
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,820
[Meng Qi moves on.]

263
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,620
[He keeps watching Wen Bing.]

264
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,420
[Follow him closely.]

265
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,380
[Chong Kai Wen came out.]

266
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,860
[And hit the right side of Wen Bing.
Wen Bing has been hit.]

267
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,060
What kind of people does
my brother mingle with? Rogues?

268
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,470
[Meng Qi takes the puck and
passes through the midfield.]

269
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,190
[He enters the defense zone.]

270
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,670
[Sang Tian follows him closely.]

271
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,660
[Meng Qi tries to shake Sang Tian off.]

272
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,860
[Nice job, the puck has been
taken by Wen Bing.]

273
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,060
[Huang Zhi Lie and Chong
Kai Wen tries to intercept.]

274
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,740
[Shen Wei Lian escorts Wen Bing.]

275
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,420
[Meng Qi catches up.]

276
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,540
[Meng Qi catches up with Wen Bing.
They are sticking with each other.]

277
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
[Wen Bing leaves Meng Qi.]

278
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,900
[And he is ready to pass the ball to
his teammates.]

279
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,900
[Chong Kai Wen hits again.]

280
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,700
Look out.

281
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,220
[Wen Bing falls badly this time.]

282
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,820
[Shen Wei Lian gets the puck.]

283
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,460
[He shoots.]

284
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,620
[It slipped away from the intercept of
Yan Wu Xu. Goal scored.]

285
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,460
[Team Freshman brought up the score.]

286
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,580
Nice.

287
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,220
Wen Bing, how are you?
Is it serious?

288
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,460
Are you okay?

289
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,420
I'm fine, just get one more point.

290
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,100
We can win the game.

291
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,420
Let's go.

292
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,270
Let's go.

293
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,780
How is this fine?

294
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,460
Go and get some rest, hurry.

295
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,500
Wei Lian.

296
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,260
Let's go.

297
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,860
Coach Ma.

298
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,340
How is he?

299
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,660
Medicine chest.

300
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,300
Hold back.

301
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,020
They are too ruthless.

302
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,670
Brother Wen Bing.

303
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,660
No, let's send him to the school clinic.

304
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,250
Are you playing ice hockey
for the first time?

305
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,540
You're making such a big fuss.

306
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,780
-Are you really okay?
-I'm fine, really.

307
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,060
No, you have to go.

308
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,420
-You...
-If you're worried,

309
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
how about I take an X-ray after the game?

310
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,300
Don't push yourself too hard.

311
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,220
Avoid them when you are back at the match.

312
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,500
Do you hear me?

313
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,780
Wen Bing.

314
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,540
Are you all right?

315
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,540
You need to trust Wen Bing.
Wen Bing is fine.

316
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,980
[There are only 5 minutes
left in the game.]

317
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,740
[The two sides are still deadlocked.]

318
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,670
[Meng Qi tried to make a long shoot.]

319
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,620
[But it gets blocked
by the goalkeeper.]

320
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,620
[The puck fell into Shen Wei Lian's hand.]

321
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,260
[Shen Wei Lian passes the puck
to Sang Tian.]

322
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,500
Pass.

323
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,940
[Wen Bing is shouting to Sang Tian to
pass the puck to him.]

324
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,900
[But Sang Tian passes it
to Shen Wei Lian.]

325
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,420
[Is it because he wants to protect
Wen Bing who is injured?]

326
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,710
[Sang Tian made a mistake.]

327
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,350
[Meng Qi gets back the puck.]

328
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,580
[Wen Bing approaches him.
Does he want to intercept?]

329
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,620
[Awesome. He intercepted
the puck from behind.]

330
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,900
[Wen Bing turns around and attacks
the defense zone of Team Senior.]

331
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,870
[Meng Qi approaches.]

332
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,980
[He pushes Wen Bing
to the boundary wall.]

333
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,070
This is too over.

334
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,860
Fighting.

335
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,310
Coach Xue, can you talk to
Coach Ma?

336
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,580
Can she let Wen Bing rest?
He seems to be injured.

337
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,090
Please. Just a while.

338
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,190
-No.
-Coach Xue, please.

339
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,980
Do you know how important
this game is for him?

340
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,700
Can you watch the game quietly?

341
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,300
Who are you?

342
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,750
I'm talking to about Wen Bing.
Mind your own business.

343
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,950
What's the matter with you?

344
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,940
He is Wen Bing's uncle.

345
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,060
[Meng Qi passes through the midfield.]

346
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,220
[Sang Tian is like a cheetah,
he runs towards Meng Qi.]

347
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,140
[And falls like a kitten.]

348
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,190
[Meng Qi attacked towards the goal post.]

349
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,660
[Goal scored.]

350
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,580
[Team Senior leads with 2:1.]

351
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,260
Did you get hurt?

352
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,940
I'm fine.

353
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,020
Fighting.

354
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,340
Do you believe in a miracle?

355
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
But now...

356
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,020
Time is almost up.

357
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,300
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

358
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,580
I bet that you can stay in Liuye.

359
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,100
[There is only one minute
left for the game.]

360
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,140
[Can the Team Freshman
bring up the score?]

361
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,100
[Let's see.]

362
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,820
[Wen Bing passes the puck to Sang Tian.]

363
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,180
[Sang Tian passed by Huang Zhi Lie
and Chong Kai Wen with the puck.]

364
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,060
[Meng Qi intercepts the puck.]

365
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,260
[Shen Wei Lian hits Meng Qi.]

366
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,460
[Sorry, I was wrong.
It was Wen Bing who pushed Meng Qi away.]

367
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,060
[The speed of Wen Bing is too fast.]

368
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,020
[Sang Tian passes
the puck to Shen Wei Lian.]

369
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,060
[Shen Wei Lian passes to Wen Bing.]

370
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,350
[An awesome long pass.]

371
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,140
[Sang Tian gets the puck.]

372
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,180
[He directly attacks the goal.]

373
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,660
[He is ready to shoot.]

374
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,910
[Goal, it was awesome.]

375
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,910
[Team Freshman brings up the score,
it is 2:2.]

376
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,110
Well done.

377
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,580
Sang Tian, you're so awesome.

378
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,220
I knew we will win.

379
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,580
Sang Tian, good job.

380
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,860
-Coach.
-Coach.

381
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,660
We have won the seniors.

382
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,220
You need to keep your promise.

383
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,460
Wen Bing has shown his leadership
in the game today.

384
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,620
So I decided to let him replace Sang Tian
to become the monitor.

385
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,820
Wen Bing becomes the monitor?

386
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,540
I don't want to be the monitor.

387
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,100
Sang Tian is more suitable than me.

388
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,860
This is an order.

389
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,170
Coach, didn't you say that
if we win the competition,

390
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,460
we can make any request?

391
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,060
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

392
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,940
Alright.

393
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
I don't want a Husky now.

394
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,110
I want Sang Tian to
continue to be the monitor.

395
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,100
Can you let me finish my word?

396
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,660
Starting from today,

397
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,020
Sang Tian will be the assistant monitor.

398
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,940
You shall assist in Wen Bing's job.

399
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,860
Coach Ma, does this mean...

400
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,060
Both of you, do your best.
Don't let me down.

401
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,350
Everyone performed well today.

402
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,630
Keep it up.

403
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,140
You are dismissed.

404
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,340
Monitor.
No, assistant monitor.

405
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,820
Why you don't make a deal with Coach Ma?

406
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,550
I'm happy enough
to be able to stay in Liuye.

407
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,340
I don't have any other requests.

408
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,340
What the hell.

409
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,740
You have no desires.

410
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,660
What about you?
Why didn't you make a deal?

411
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm the same as him.

412
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,580
You should have let us win.

413
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,740
The deal allows for anything, but it
was wasted by both of you.

414
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,630
It's so boring, let's go.

415
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,420
Since there is no one around,
can you tell me...

416
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,260
what have you told Coach Ma secretly?

417
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,100
You were acting mysteriously.

418
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,790
I won't let you know.

419
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,060
-Tell me.
-No.

420
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,460
-Alright
-We are on the same team.

421
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,460
Wen Bing.

422
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,100
Wen Bing.

423
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,860
Wen Bing.

424
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,660
Wen Bing.

425
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,580
Wen Bing.

426
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,140
Wen Bing.

427
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,550
You're awake.

428
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,700
Are you okay?

429
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,070
You cried.

430
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,340
No, I didn't.

431
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,270
Then why are your eyes red?

432
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,460
Maybe it's conjunctivitis.

433
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,340
Brother Wen Bing.

434
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,820
Brother Wen Bing.

435
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,950
You, are you okay?

436
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,260
Do you need an operation?

437
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,780
Will there be any consequences
after the operation?

438
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,420
Where is the school doctor?

439
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,740
Why is there no doctor
in such a large infirmary?

440
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,550
Who is responsible
if there is a delay?

441
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,700
The school doctor checked on him.
Nothing serious.

442
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,460
How is it?

443
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,460
Mild dislocation.

444
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,740
Dislocation.

445
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,340
Does he need to be hospitalised?

446
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,470
If needed, let me take care of him.

447
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,340
Excuse me, sorry.

448
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,260
Here.

449
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,060
Get up.

450
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,860
I will fix your arm for you.

451
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,940
Here.

452
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,780
Sang Tian, I will need your help
in the next few days.

453
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,220
Yeah, and this.

454
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,780
Apply it once each morning and night.

455
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,620
Remember, massage
at least ten minutes every day.

456
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,940
Let me do this.

457
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,780
Girls are more attentive.

458
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,870
Who said that a boy must be careless?

459
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,220
Oh my god.

460
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,700
Right?

461
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,820
No. Let me do this.

462
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,940
He hurt his arm.

463
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,670
He needs to take off his clothes
when he uses medicine.

464
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,180
It is inconvenient for a girl.

465
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,630
-I don't mind.
-I mind.

466
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,460
If the treatment delays,
it will get worse.

467
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,550
All right. Enough.

468
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,420
Sang Tian, I'll count on you.

469
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,420
Stop staring, let's go.

470
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,220
Let Sang Tian helps him to apply
the medicine. Go, go, go.

471
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,140
-Brother Wen Bing, have a good rest.
-Let's go

472
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,030
I will see you tomorrow.

473
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,620
Stop looking. He needs to apply medicine.

474
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,780
You better don't mess up.

475
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,630
Well,

476
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,310
I didn't know that
you're Wen Bing's uncle.

477
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,340
I was rude to you in the skating rink.

478
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,060
I'm sorry.

479
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,740
It's okay.

480
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,990
After all, there are very few
young and promising uncles like me.

481
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,100
I forgive you.

482
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,870
Can I add your contact?

483
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,860
You can ask me anything about
Wen Bing in school at any time.

484
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,900
I'm sure no one in Liuye cares
more about him...

485
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,140
and understands him more than me.

486
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,670
There is no need for that.

487
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,110
I can understand him myself.

488
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,790
And, if you really care about him,

489
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,430
please look for your brother
immediately.

490
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,700
And talk with him.

491
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,940
Yes. All these happened
because of him.

492
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,180
I will find him now.

493
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,910
Nephew.

494
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,060
I can only help you until this far.

495
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,060
Help me remove my clothes.

496
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,230
Raise your hand.

497
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,950
I can't take it out.

498
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,110
You take it from the back first.

499
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,540
Excuse me.

500
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,070
You get up for a while.

501
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,810
Is your hand okay?

502
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,660
How, how is it?

503
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,810
What do you think?

504
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,090
Do you still need to apply medicine?

505
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,540
Of course.

506
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,659
Then we will continue.

507
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Darling.

508
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,699
Let's go have lunch.

509
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,030
-Do you like it?
-It's really nice.

510
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,350
Public display of affection.

511
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,510
She got a boyfriend so fast.

512
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,720
Have you made a miscalculation?

513
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,220
Were you figuring out how to get back
the items that you've sent out before?

514
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,340
How is it possible?
I'm not this kind of person.

515
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,420
I don't care what kind of
people you are.

516
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,120
I will return those items to you.
I don't like owing favours.

517
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,200
If Brother Wen Bing has any after effects,

518
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,800
I will never forgive you.

519
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,630
You let me down.

520
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,780
No.

521
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,070
Na Na.

522
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,060
I didn't like you before.

523
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,540
But now, let me tell you clearly.

524
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,540
I hate you.

525
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,830
What you did makes me sick.

526
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,780
Miao Miao.

527
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,560
As a leader, you didn't think
about the unity in the team.

528
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,520
You bullied the others every day
and played tricks,

529
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,630
looking for a sense of presence
in front of the freshman.

530
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,520
Can't you just train properly?

531
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,340
I'm really disappointed with you.

532
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,340
I'm really disappointed with you guys.

533
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,780
-Captain, we were wrong.
-We know our fault.

534
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,060
Squat lower.
Let's see if you guys dare do it again.

535
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
[You haven't left yet?]

536
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,880
[Hurry, there's no time and
the task is urgent.]

537
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,050
I have something to do later.

538
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,780
You are here now.
You go up yourself.

539
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,960
Where are you going?

540
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,850
It's a secret.

541
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,520
Who promised that he will
take care of me just now?

542
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,680
In the next moment,
you're leaving me alone now.

543
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,030
Don't you have any conscience?

544
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,480
I accompanied you to the infirmary, right?

545
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,790
Besides, the doctor said that you need to rest.

546
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,470
I will disturb your rest
if I'm in the hostel.

547
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,420
-I'm leaving now, goodbye.
-Hold on.
