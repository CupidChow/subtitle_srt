[My Unicorn Girl]

3

[Episode 22. The genius artist
and his secret assistant]

4
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,560
Everything is packed.

5
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,990
Put some strength into it.

6
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,300
Isn't that the class monitor?

7
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,120
Why isn't the vice monitor with him?

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,240
Come on.

9
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,400
What did you buy?

10
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,170
This is not for you.

11
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,170
Where is Sang Tian?

12
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,140
-Sang Tian?
-I don't know.

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,910
[Something is off with Sang Tian today.]

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,840
[I bet it's your doing.]

15
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,920
[The man should compromise.]

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,440
[You shouldn't upset her.]

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,920
[Are you trying to cheer her up
with just oden?]

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,440
[You need more than that.]

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,410
Sang Tian and Miao Miao!

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,960
I bought some drinks.

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,270
Come on, hand these out.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,520
Thank you, Senior.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,900
Stop calling me that.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,000
Just "Miao Miao" will do.

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,240
Because from now on...

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,340
I am Sang Tian's girlfriend.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,860
A new girlfriend.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,840
What about that Milk Tea Girl?

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,120
Nonsense.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
-Why can't I ask?
-[This guy is too calm?]

31
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,460
[Is he really her boyfriend?]

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,320
Comes and goes like the wind.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,940
Am I right? Tian Tian?

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,120
Senior is right.

35
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,970
Stop calling me that.

36
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,970
We've been together for so long.
That title makes me feel old.

37
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,930
The teasing is killing me.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,520
We are off to the training.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,079
I'll leave you be.

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,680
-Goodbye, Senior.
-Goodbye.

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Let's go.

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,090
Don't be a third wheel.

43
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,570
Your hair is a mess.

44
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,990
Senior Miao Miao.

45
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,190
Do you know...

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,570
the meaning of "Ti amo"?

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
It means I love you in Italian.

48
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,080
It seems like everyone knows.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,970
Except for one.

50
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,790
He is such a simpleton.

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
Miao Miao, maybe you should go home.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,800
I am headed for the training.
I'll see you later.

53
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,810
No. I am skipping class today
just to be with you.

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,240
I have it already.

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,130
What are you laughing at?

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,570
She wants you to open
the bottle cap for her.

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Boyfriends do that. Don't you get it?

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,360
It's the 21st century.
Set aside your manly pride.

59
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,630
It's all right, Tian Tian.

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
That's right.

61
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,510
Fine, as long as you're happy.

62
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,450
We are happy.

63
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,300
I need to head home.

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,350
Remember to inform Coach Ma for me.

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,930
[Why is he going home?]

66
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,519
[Could it be...]

67
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,430
[that he noticed something?]

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,960
Miss me, honey.

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,950
Chen Chen.

71
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,800
Chen Chen, hear me out.

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,250
Chen Chen, hear me...

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
You can't eat instant noodles.

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,680
-Let's get some decent food.
-I'm in a hurry.

75
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,050
Fine, wait here.

76
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,090
Hey, Ying Ying.

77
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,080
Well, I am still...

78
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,120
having a meeting.

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,560
We will watch a midnight movie together.

80
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,810
You miss me?

81
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,170
Chen Chen.

82
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,650
Instant noodle and ham.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,890
It's like a mash of
Chen Chen and Qin Lang.

84
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,440
Enjoy.

85
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,040
The way you eat is so cute.

86
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,110
I'll call you my Little Piggy from now on.

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,310
Little Piggy.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,940
I...

89
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,480
It's you again!

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
You pay for your actions sooner or later.

91
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,640
Listen closely.

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,159
Stop bothering me and Chen Chen.

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
Stop now or I am calling the police.

94
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,960
Scoundrel.

95
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,680
-But...
-Do you mind explaining yourself?

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,550
What is this?

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
All of these are the girls you are dating.

98
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,600
What?

99
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
First, I am not a scoundrel.

100
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,760
My name is Qin Lang.

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Secondly, I don't know them at all.

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,510
Chen Chen, let's go.

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,840
I want you to explain.

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
I...

105
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,080
It's not like he can.

106
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,420
Let me tell you the story.

107
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,880
Little Bunny, receptionist of bar.

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,910
Ying Ying, student of dancing academy.

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,760
Little Cutie, owner of TaoBao store.

110
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,160
And there is Little Piggy.

111
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,410
I gave Chen Chen that nickname...

112
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,400
Wait. Chen Chen, hear me out.

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
They are all my sisters.

114
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,409
They are here for groceries.

115
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,080
-He is framing me.
-Sisters, right?

116
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,200
Fine, I will make a phone call.

117
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,400
Let's see if I'm framing you.

118
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,500
Brother!

119
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,890
So it's true.

120
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,210
It's true.

121
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,560
So what?

122
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,530
Love is a matter of...

123
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,410
dating whoever you like.

124
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,990
Break up when it doesn't work.

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,360
I didn't point a gun at you
to make you do it.

126
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,740
One more thing.

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,240
A piece of advice.

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,560
With your bad temper...

129
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,180
and your hypocrisy,

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,560
I doubt you will ever get married.

131
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,890
Jerk!

132
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,480
Let's go.

133
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,230
Just now,

134
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,690
Thank you.

135
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Don't mention it.

136
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,320
I don't like that guy anyway.

137
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,440
This is embarrassing.

138
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Not at all.

139
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,080
Every young lady...

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,590
has a crush on a jerk.

141
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Fair point.

142
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,220
And with you in the equation,

143
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,040
that makes two.

144
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,250
I don't like the way you put it.

145
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,680
You compare me with
that world class scoundrel?

146
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,640
This is a humiliation
to my honour and pride.

147
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,159
So you will be...

148
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
the normal harmless jerk.

149
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,200
How does that sound?

150
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,010
Why did that sound like...

151
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,169
it's worse than before?

152
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,330
Who says so?

153
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,480
A normal jerk is not hopeless.

154
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
"A normal jerk is not hopeless"?

155
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,070
Chen Chen, do you mean...

156
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,830
I can have another chance at you?

157
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,780
Wait for me!

158
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Sang Tian.

159
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,620
Why are you so sweaty?

160
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,560
-You must be exhausted.
-Over there.

161
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,600
-Here, have some water.
-What is going on with them?

162
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,000
This is so sweet!

163
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,840
Senior is so thoughtful.

164
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,330
Come.

165
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,090
Let's go.

166
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,690
Let's go.

167
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,680
-Come.
-Feeling warm?

168
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,770
Senior Miao Miao?

169
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,440
I've been thinking.

170
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,790
I can't be in a relationship with you.

171
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,220
Because...

172
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,250
You don't like girls?

173
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,240
No.

174
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Because...

175
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,610
I...

176
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,470
have always been a girl.

177
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,200
Silly!

178
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
You don't seem surprised.

179
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,380
I knew that a long time ago.

180
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
I also overheard your conversation
about getting a girlfriend.

181
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,010
[That gestures you make
with your hands...]

182
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,010
[are so elegant and captivating.]

183
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
[Even I can't do that.]

184
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,630
So you knew...

185
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,240
the moment you first saw me?

186
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,760
Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't help
with your homework.

187
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,870
Because you were supposed to be
my junior from Figure Skating Department.

188
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,380
I didn't do well in the test.

189
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,300
So I didn't make it.

190
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,750
Do you still regret it?

191
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,630
I was devastated at the time.

192
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,690
But then I joined Ice Hockey Department.

193
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,360
I realised...

194
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,310
I am not that into figure skating.

195
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,120
So, you slowly fell in love
with ice hockey?

196
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,280
You can put it that way.

197
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,880
Did you fall in love with the sport
because of a particular someone?

198
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,240
You could even tell that?

199
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,280
Of course, I know everything.

200
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,810
But I also know that...

201
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,480
something means a lot to you.

202
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,280
What is it?

203
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,980
Judging by my observation...

204
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,860
and speculation on that boy,

205
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,400
I think it's safe to say that...

206
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,760
he knows you are a girl.

207
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,260
What?

208
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,720
I bet you have questions for him.

209
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,890
Go on.

210
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,320
Thank you, Senior Miao Miao.

211
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Go on. Go.

212
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,800
I'll go now.

213
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,220
Again?

214
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,450
Hurry up.

215
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,990
Senior Miao Miao.

216
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,320
Senior, you can't leave.

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,230
My captain wants to talk to you.

218
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,850
What is it this time?

219
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Are you really dating Sang Tian?

220
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,540
None of your concern.

221
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,030
I don't understand.

222
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,480
What do you even like about him?

223
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,120
Shen Qiao Di from Qianbei University,

224
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,800
the guy who crushed you...

225
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,600
during the high school league last year,

226
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,760
Sang Tian was the first to challenge him.

227
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,720
He should have known better.

228
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
I disagree.

229
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,730
In this world we live in,

230
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,690
plenty of people take action
based on confidence.

231
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,570
Such as you, Meng Qi.

232
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,730
People think you are outstanding.

233
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,880
But I like the way
Sang Tian challenged the impossible.

234
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,850
I like how Sang Tian was so fearless.

235
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Miao Miao, will you give me
another chance?

236
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,930
We'll talk...

237
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,180
when you can stop ordering your men...

238
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
to do your bidding.

239
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,000
Senior Miao Miao!

240
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,090
Captain, go after her.

241
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,850
When I win
the University Ice Hockey League,

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,310
I will win her back.

243
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,760
Did you ask Sang Tian to get a girlfriend?

244
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,820
Does Sang Tian have one now?

245
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,250
Shouldn't you feel happy for him?

246
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,260
You interfered in my choice of school,

247
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,640
and now you interfere in my social life.

248
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,090
Right?

249
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,640
You want me out of your hair,

250
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,240
but do you even know...

251
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,550
what should and shouldn't be done
among friends?

252
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,250
I know well enough.

253
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,840
Really?

254
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
See for yourself.

255
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,680
That's why he's been acting odd.

256
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,560
How can you still smile about it?

257
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,360
Do you know what you are doing?

258
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,560
You are both men.

259
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,140
This is outrageous.

260
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,790
You're even living with him.

261
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,580
Mum, you don't understand.

262
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,090
What do you mean?

263
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,320
From the moment I got into
Liuye Sports University,

264
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,720
I already knew she was a girl.

265
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,160
If you knew she was a girl,

266
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,840
how could you allow her...

267
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,800
to live in your dormitory?

268
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,010
You got it all wrong.

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,500
She was the one who refused,

270
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,200
not me.

271
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,840
So you wanted to live
in the same room with her?

272
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,680
Mum.

273
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,240
Sang Tian is not like what you think.

274
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,930
The reason why she disguised as a boy...

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,160
is because her mother studied
at Liuye Sports University.

276
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
That's the place where she finds
her connection with her mother.

277
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,960
Also, when we had a fight last time,

278
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
she was there to console me
and cheer me up.

279
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,760
She told me that
she was envious of my life.

280
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,850
Because even if we had our differences,

281
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,360
there is always a chance to reconcile.

282
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,890
Yet she will never...

283
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
get to meet her mother again.

284
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
[Which is why I envy Wen Bing.]

285
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,770
[Because he has always known
his love for ice hockey.]

286
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
[If his love for the sport...]

287
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,920
[could get the blessing of his family,]

288
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,570
[then he would be the happiest man alive.]

289
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,610
[I don't have that chance anymore.]

290
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,080
[But I hope that...]

291
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,840
[he could be one of them.]

292
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,440
Even if you are telling the truth,

293
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,050
you still can't keep living with her.

294
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,920
In the people's eyes, she is a boy.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,560
You can't go in there.
The Chairman is busy!

296
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,900
-Let me through!
-Stop!

297
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,520
What did you say to her?

298
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,960
Auntie, don't listen to him.

299
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,430
Mum.

300
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I don't care.

301
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I like her.

302
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,040
I know for sure...

303
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,070
she also likes me.

304
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,810
However,

305
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,020
she doesn't know that
I had found out she was a girl.

306
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,960
But I confessed my love.

307
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
Since it has already come to this point,

308
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,920
there is nothing I can do.

309
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,030
But I want you to remember.

310
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,850
To the others,

311
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,640
you two are men.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,120
Men should act like men do.

313
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,050
Don't ever kiss each other
in public again.

314
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,080
Auntie, that day was because...

315
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,480
the match meant a lot to him.

316
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,080
Plus, you were there.

317
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,840
I was trying to help him so...

318
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,609
Is that how you help?

319
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,910
Is this how...

320
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
you've always done it?

321
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,700
Yes. This is how you help me out.

322
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,880
[Curse you!]

323
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,810
[When did you find out I was a girl?]

324
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,440
[Silly.]

325
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,020
[We are always together.]

326
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,400
[How would I not know?]

327
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,360
[Not everyone is a fool like you.]

328
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,400
[What did you say? That I like you too?]

329
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,560
[Where did you get the confidence?]

330
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,880
[I don't like you.]

331
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,280
[Stop pretending.]

332
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
[Let's see how long you can pretend.]

333
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,080
Are you two done?

334
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,000
I am still here.

335
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,440
I want you to listen up.

336
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,450
From now on, you two cannot
live in the same room anymore.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
-Is that clear?
-Yes, Mother.

338
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,310
Yes, Mother.

339
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,160
I mean, Auntie!

340
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,640
Is your mother...

341
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,650
going to be mad at us?

342
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,800
Of course not.

343
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,560
She has a soft heart.

344
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,080
She said she wouldn't watch the game,

345
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,400
but she came anyway.

346
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,800
As long as she is not against it,

347
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
that means she agreed.

348
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,740
Agreed on what?

349
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,760
What do you think?

350
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,040
Someone still owes me an answer.

351
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,250
Don't you dare bring that up.

352
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,200
You've been lying to me.

353
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,570
Be honest with me.

354
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,480
When did you know I was a girl?

355
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Guess, you get three chances.

356
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,920
During the barbecue?

357
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,470
No, before that.

358
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Before that?

359
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,300
Before that...

360
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,760
Could it be...

361
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Do you mean...

362
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,030
that day at the locker room?

363
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,920
Which day at the locker room?

364
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,360
Well...

365
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,310
Well...

366
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,360
You...

367
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,450
You know...

368
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,020
You mean that day with the CPR?

369
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,550
-Was it?
-No.

370
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,110
Way before that.

371
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,850
So when was it?

372
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,160
You have one chance left.

373
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,480
Punishment awaits if you get it wrong.

374
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,630
But...

375
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,280
Nothing I guessed was right.

376
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,930
Was it that day at the swimming pool?

377
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,800
You found out on my first day at school?

378
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,600
I have a keen sight.

379
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,120
Nothing can escape my sharp eyes.

380
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,210
Stop bluffing.

381
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,240
Just because you saw through my disguise,

382
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,100
doesn't mean you are a genius.

383
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,060
So,

384
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,800
will you give me your answer now?

385
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,360
What answer?

386
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I don’t understand

387
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,050
If you don't object,

388
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
then I take it as a yes.

389
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,760
You should head back.

390
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,730
Auntie told you to see me off
at the door.

391
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,490
You've come way too far.

392
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,140
Indeed.

393
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,640
The door of the dorm.

394
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,040
My drawing, give it back.

395
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,970
I burnt it.

396
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,840
You drew a picture of mine

397
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,160
That was without my consent.

398
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,320
So why did you burn it?

399
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
I thought you didn't care.

400
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,120
Torn or burnt, what is the difference?

401
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,360
Of course it's different.

402
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,200
I don't care, you must pay.

403
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,240
Pay up.

404
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,370
No way.

405
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,400
That's more like it.

406
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,050
I am really glad
you are friends again.

407
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,320
Hey, Sang Tian.
How are things going?

408
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,600
What?

409
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,200
You settled everything?

410
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
But I bought the plane ticket
at full price to be here!

411
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
My Pattaya trip!

412
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,840
You are happily in love,

413
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,120
but my ticket, my vacation!

414
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,830
What?

415
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,970
Don't ever forget our promise.

416
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,410
Promise me.

417
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,000
Fine, get back to your class. Bye.

418
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,170
Xiao Rou.

419
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,710
Why are you here so early?

420
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,860
Who was on the phone with you for so long?

421
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,160
You seem to be in a good mood.

422
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,370
Why? Did something good happen?

423
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,960
I just saw Sang Tian
with the person he loves.

424
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,590
I feel happy for him.

425
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,610
What is going on today?

426
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,920
Happy endings everywhere.

427
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,160
Somehow, you don't seem upset.

428
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,440
Didn't you just break up?

429
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,400
Why should I be upset?
When did I ever break up?

430
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,070
Sang Tian...

431
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,530
is now dating Miao Miao, right?

432
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,560
Actually...

433
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,760
Actually, I may look care-free,

434
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,370
but it's just for show.

435
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,370
My heart...

436
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,360
is already in a million pieces.

437
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,170
Cheer up.

438
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,830
If you truly love someone,
you ask nothing in return.

439
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,120
Breaking up is not a scar in memory,

440
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,560
it should be a medal of honour.

441
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
[Why do I find that somewhat familiar?]

442
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,450
Let it all out.

443
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,060
I am not going to cry.

444
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,730
Sang Tian is now with the person he loves.

445
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,820
As a friend, I should feel happy for him,

446
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,490
from the bottom of my heart.

447
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,600
You are right.

448
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,010
That is the right mindset.

449
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
-May Sang Tian be happy.
-May Sang Tian be happy.

450
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

451
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,050
What happened?

452
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,280
-That hurts.
-Have a seat.

453
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,380
Over there.

454
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,840
Slow down.

455
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,400
Slow down.

456
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,860
Which leg is it?

457
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
It hurts.

458
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,270
You had me worried.

459
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,430
Be gentle.

460
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,700
I am warning you.
Don't wear high heels again.

461
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,140
I wore them to see you.

462
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,090
Just wear trainers if you like them.

463
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,500
If you hate wearing dresses,
then don't.

464
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,040
You don't have to make changes
just for me.

465
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,290
I like you just the way you are.

466
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,320
Get on.

467
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,490
What are you doing?

468
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,800
I'll carry you home.

469
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,840
You don't have to.

470
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,950
-Just come.
I...

471
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,210
Get up.

472
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,730
Hold this.

473
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,160
Okay, slowly.

474
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
You look like you have some weight,

475
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
but you are lighter than you look.

476
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,290
Are you calling me heavy?

477
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Slowly.

478
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,720
Listen, don't ever wear high heels again.

479
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,760
Is that clear?

480
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,210
Okay.

481
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,450
-All right.
-Be careful.

482
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,520
Have a seat.

483
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,240
I'll get you a drink.

484
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,490
Okay.

485
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,760
Be careful.

486
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,800
All right.

487
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,960
[This doesn't suit her style.]

488
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,760
Do-Re-Mi.

489
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,310
So many love comics.

490
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,960
Cheng Min Jun.

491
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,040
Well...

492
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,160
Do you prefer juice or beer?

493
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,690
Beer.

494
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,250
No, I'll have juice.

495
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,790
A family pack?

496
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,320
"Ikemen Paradise"?

497
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,880
No. These belong to my nephew.

498
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,610
Hello?

499
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Fei Fei.

500
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
What's wrong?

501
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,100
All right. I'll be right there.

502
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,650
What is it?

503
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,320
Did she have a break-up again?

504
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,920
[Cheng Min Jun, I broke up again.]

505
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,350
She contacted me too.

506
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,400
-Well...
-Well...

507
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,410
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

508
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,770
Hold on.

509
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,180
You go ahead.

510
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,600
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

511
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,120
I'll keep you company
for another 15 minutes.

512
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,730
There's a matter I must see to.

513
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,840
I don't want you to be bored, go ahead.

514
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,970
It's okay.

515
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,490
I like comics.

516
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,800
This is not meant for you.

517
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,930
Go on.

518
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,130
-But...
-Just go.

519
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Go ahead.

520
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,920
I'll be there soon.

521
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,030
[Ikemen Paradise]

522
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,520
Not even a text to tell me he's home.

523
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,120
[My guess was right, right?]

524
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,660
[He really likes you.]

525
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,640
[He must have found out a long time ago.]

526
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,040
If he likes me so much,

527
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,840
he could at least say "Good night".

528
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,390
[Good night, see you in class tomorrow.]

529
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,950
[Wen Bing: Good night.
See you in class tomorrow.]

530
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,380
Ten...

531
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,440
Nine, eight, seven...

532
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,000
six, five, four...

533
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,640
three, two, one!

534
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,260
[Sang Tian: Good night.]

535
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,360
Good night.

536
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,150
-You've all been training.
-You've improved a lot.

537
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,760
-That's right.
-Here.

538
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,410
Warm up your hands. It's cold.

539
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,240
How thoughtful of you.

540
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,840
How about some hotpot?

541
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,760
Let's have hotpot together tonight.

542
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,610
-That is a great idea.
-Let's go.

543
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,390
I am sorry,
but I am seeing someone tonight.

544
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,040
So I can't join you guys
for the hotpot later.

545
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,800
You mean Senior Miao Miao?

546
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,490
I should go now.

547
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,160
See you all later.

548
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,690
Okay.

549
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

550
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,080
-Wen Bing, you should come with us.
-Right.

551
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,810
I am meeting someone tonight too.

552
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,280
[Seriously?]

553
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,160
[Don't make it so obvious.]

554
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,820
You are seeing Meng Na tonight?

555
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,320
Then go on.
Stop showing off your relationship.

556
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,830
Go.

557
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Bye.

558
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,520
Let's go.

559
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,960
Senior Miao Miao went
to Moscow yesterday, right?

560
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,800
Right, she shouldn't be here.

561
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,920
-So why...
-Are you two single people...

562
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,080
going to get some food?

563
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Come on.

564
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,420
Something is not right.

565
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,880
After so long,
you finally bought me some oden.

566
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,470
I never forgot.

567
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,160
I just didn't get the right timing.

568
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,880
So what makes the right timing?

569
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,290
We sneaked off to eat.

570
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,530
We need to keep it down.

571
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,440
Hurry up and eat.

572
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,850
You have to go home later.

573
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,650
I am taking my time with this.

574
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,040
I can't see you at home.

575
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,070
When were you so smooth?

576
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,560
Can't they pick
another day for renovation?

577
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,600
Now I can't have my hotpot.

578
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,960
We can get some oden.

579
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,150
It's been so long.

580
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,480
I can treat you to hotpot.

581
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,450
-That should do it.
-Let's go.

582
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,470
Isn't that the vice monitor?

583
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,420
Sang Tian?

584
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,960
Vice Monitor, what are you doing here?

585
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,210
Isn't that...

586
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,420
Class Monitor? Why is he here?

587
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,070
Class Monitor.

588
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,880
What are the odds?

589
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,920
Maybe we can join the tables
and eat together.

590
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,160
How does that sound?

591
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay.

592
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,090
Great.

593
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,290
Have one.

594
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,350
-This fishball tastes good.
-Wen Bing.

595
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,130
Aren't you meeting Meng Na?

596
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,700
You have a date too, right?

597
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,720
So why are you two here now?

598
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,250
She stood me up.

599
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,220
What are the odds, me too.

600
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,510
Poor things.

601
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,680
You two are the Stood-Up Brothers.

602
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,600
We asked you to join us for hotpot.

603
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,530
You should've joined us.

604
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,350
You two deserved it.

605
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,700
You should've joined us but you refused.

606
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,240
-You just have to come on your own.
-That's right.

607
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,400
Women are trouble.

608
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,330
Right, Sang Tian?

609
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,840
Yes.

610
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,730
Women are so troublesome.

611
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,810
So that's what it is.

612
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,980
Have you decided
who you are in love with?

613
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,960
I don't know.

614
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,199
I thought I would choose Wen Bing
to be my only love.

615
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,320
But in the end...

616
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,199
But recently... I...

617
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,850
I keep thinking about Kidney Hurt.

618
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,080
We'll have a game. Don't overthink.

619
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,680
Just let me know what you choice is.

620
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,600
-Left or right?
-Left.

621
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,160
-Coffee or tea?
-Tea.

622
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,720
-Winter or summer?
-Winter.

623
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,280
-Wen Bing or Kidney Hurt?
-Kidney Hurt.

624
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,890
He's been trying to ask you out, right?

625
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,160
Text him.

626
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,500
Is that really necessary?

627
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,340
Let me do it.

628
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,410
[Meet me at
Liuye Sports University at 9 p.m.]

629
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,200
Done.

630
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,120
You asked him out?

631
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,160
Go on.

632
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,920
Hello?

633
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,930
What are you doing now?

634
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,490
I am just checking if you've
turned the room into a pig sty.

635
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,240
[You are the pig.]

636
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,080
Why aren't you saying "Ti amo"?

637
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,730
You won't fool me.

638
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,100
-Sang Tian.
-[Hurry up.]

639
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,770
[Come on, take the vantage point.]

640
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
She hung up on me.

641
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,230
You...

642
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,350
Hurry up!

643
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,160
Sang Tian, come here!

644
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,480
How is the network?

645
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,590
[Huang Hao Ran and Xiao Xiao
are here to watch the game.]

646
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,810
[I'll talk to you later.]

647
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,920
[Why can't you remember to lock the door?]

648
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
[This is what happens.]

649
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,960
[The whole room is filled with guys.]

650
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,760
[They better not cause any trouble.]

651
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,040
[I am not getting a reply.]

652
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,720
-Give me the Cola.
-[Is he mad at me?]

653
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,960
Sang Tian, hurry up.

654
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,040
Sang Tian. What are you hiding?

655
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,560
Show us.

656
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,400
Xiao Xiao, don't look at it.

657
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,760
The resemblance is uncanny.

658
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,000
This is marvellous.

659
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,290
Everyone, look!

660
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,000
It's like a photo.

661
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,920
Whose work is this? This is remarkable.

662
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,740
The person who drew this
must be in love with you.

663
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,920
And look, each of these
is a moment from his life.

664
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,720
This could only be someone close to you
in real life.

665
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,640
Could it be...

666
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,360
I drew that.

667
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,330
Forget it, Wei Lian.

668
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,730
You can draw?

669
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,240
Why haven't we noticed before?

670
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,880
There is more you don't know.

671
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,990
You can draw too?

672
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,980
Then show us.

673
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,230
Show us.

674
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,410
-That should be nice.
-Show us.

675
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,200
Come on. Draw a picture of me first.

676
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,830
Make me look macho.

677
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,140
Fine, but only one picture.

678
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,160
Come on, draw me. Hands at my waist,
or should I place them here?

679
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,840
A smiling face or a more serious look?

680
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,410
Should I show the dimple...

681
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,090
Make me slimmer. Stretch the legs, taller.

682
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,420
It's a little short.

683
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,840
Should I undress?

684
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,840
Shen Wei Lian, is this a joke?

685
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,170
Look!

686
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,880
Please, what is this?

687
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,320
Come up with better lies
the next time you bluff.

688
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
You don't understand.

689
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,280
This is abstract art.

690
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,440
This is a work of art.

691
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,560
Get it?

692
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,240
I don't know about abstract,

693
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,440
but I want to punch you.

694
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,280
-Don't fight.
-Sang Tian.

695
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,310
Be honest with us.

696
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,490
Who drew this?

697
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,640
Stop making us guess.

698
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,880
Tell us. Who was it?

699
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,730
It was me.

700
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,880
Stop bluffing.

701
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,760
Wei Lian just played us for fools.

702
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,280
So don't bother. It's pointless.

703
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,240
That's right.

704
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,160
Who drew this?
This is very well done.

705
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,440
There is something...

706
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,900
I've been hiding from everyone.

707
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,560
I haven't told any of you.

708
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,530
But since you found out,

709
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,010
then I shall confess.

710
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,720
-What is it?
-What?

711
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,720
[This kid is insane.]

712
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,280
[If you want to make it official,]

713
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
[at least discuss with
Sang Tian beforehand.]

714
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,180
The truth is,

715
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,320
I am a genuine artist.

716
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,050
That is lame.

717
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,590
When I have free time,

718
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,970
I use him as the model...

719
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,360
for my drawing practice.

720
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,890
I see.

721
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,640
Since the prodigy is here,

722
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,080
why don't you draw us one...

723
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,810
that is less abstract?

724
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,800
-Sure.
-He...

725
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,330
He can't.

726
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,090
Give me ten minutes.

727
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,880
I need to discuss the sketch
with my assistant.

728
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,860
Who is your assistant?

729
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,600
Him.

730
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,080
What are you talking about?

731
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,060
You have prosopagnosia.
How are you supposed to draw?

732
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,290
I must say my handsomeness
is earth-shattering.

733
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,030
That's why you fell for me.

734
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,500
You have class.

735
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,250
Am I...

736
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,330
having some problem with my taste?

737
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,150
It's done.

738
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,460
This is pretty much a photo.

739
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,770
The work of a genius indeed.

740
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,420
Thanks to my assistant.

741
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,740
I want to be your assistant.

742
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,730
You can't make it, let me have the job.

743
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,250
-Me too!
-Let me do it.

744
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,330
-No.
-Stop, I get the job.

745
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,740
You all should forget about it.

746
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,910
So we are calling it a day.

747
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,200
Come earlier next time.

748
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,210
-Party-pooper.
-You are no fun.

749
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,210
All right, we're going back to our rooms.

750
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,330
Goodbye.

751
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,930
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

752
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,820
I don't think you came back...

753
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,970
just to draw them a painting.

754
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,360
I came back...

755
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,680
because...

756
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,460
Well...

757
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,370
I am thirsty.

758
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,730
Why do I feel like...

759
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,570
you miss me too much?

760
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:36,930
What?

761
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,790
See your boss off.

762
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,530
I know you miss me too much.

763
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,130
I have one more dream.

764
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,060
To hold a portrait exhibition.

765
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,490
My little helper Sang Tian,

766
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,000
will you help me out?

767
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,290
I don't have the time.

768
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,730
Ask Xiao Xiao.

769
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,250
He would be happy to help.

770
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,920
Sang Zhan.

771
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,630
-Sister.
-Why are you here?

772
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,850
Actually I...

773
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,320
-My brother is...
-Don't worry.

774
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,810
I knew she's a girl.

775
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,080
You knew?

776
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,530
You scared me. If you didn't know,
my sister could have...

777
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,220
finished me off...

778
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,680
Don't you dare bring that up.

779
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,800
She is your sister?
