[Episode 19: The Appearance
of the Black Umbrella Rider]

4
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,960
We...

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Shall we...

6
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,600
Sang Tian.

7
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,289
-Wei Lian, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

8
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,160
-Are you really all right?
-I'm fine.

9
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,050
I'm here to return the present.

10
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,009
I almost forgot.

11
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,690
That husky toy,
I will get one for you tomorrow.

12
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,170
-All right.
-Thank you, Sang Tian.

13
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,250
I have to leave first.

14
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,330
-Bye.
-Bye.

15
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,890
Why did he run so fast?

16
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,130
-He's rushing back to staunch the blood.
-You should be blamed for that.

17
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,370
You slammed the door too hard.

18
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,850
Why didn't he knock the door?
Serve him right.

19
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,130
What you said is correct,

20
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,329
but you're too heartless.

21
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,810
Quickly wash up and sleep.

22
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,570
Sorry.

23
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,130
-What's wrong with your nose?
-I'm fine.

24
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,410
-What do you want to drink?
-Anything.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,130
You always come after the shop is closed.

26
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,370
You're taking up my off-hour
and you're saying "anything"?

27
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,850
Then, the same order.

28
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,290
Original milk tea.
Full sugar and add ice.

29
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,650
That's more like it.
Let me tell you.

30
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,450
Choosing milk tea is
something very serious.

31
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,810
Remember it.

32
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,370
Can I ask you a question?

33
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,410
Yes.

34
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,090
If I thought a girl likes me,

35
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,250
but it was actually a misunderstanding.

36
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,090
Then, I feel sad.

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,010
What does this mean?

38
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,210
This means that you like her.

39
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,810
Think about it. If you don't like her...

40
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,410
and she doesn't like you.

41
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,810
You should be relieved.

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,170
This will not affect the relationship
between the both of you.

43
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,970
But you're feeling disappointed.

44
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,490
This means that you fell in love
with her without realising it.

45
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,770
-No.
-You should know better.

46
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,770
I know I'm handsome.

47
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,570
You don't have to keep staring at me.

48
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,650
I didn't stare at you.

49
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,650
I just think that your hairstyle today...

50
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,420
It's obvious that you're
pretending to be young.

51
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,780
That means handsome.

52
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,380
Narcissist.

53
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,900
Let's go.

54
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,300
The most painful thing in life...

55
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,860
is that we made the same mistake twice.

56
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,460
Sang Tian

57
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,900
You shouldn't be forcing
your little brain.

58
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,260
Why not beg me for help?

59
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,300
I may consider giving you extra
lessons, so you can at least pass.

60
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,020
I would never beg anyone for help.

61
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Especially...

62
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,300
someone like you.

63
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,900
Look at my shirt.
What's going on?

64
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,240
-No problem.
-Why does it look weird?

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,540
It looks fine.

66
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,659
Class monitor. Your elbow has recovered?

67
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,500
Why did you change your hairstyle too?

68
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,020
It is mainly because of the very touching
birthday surprise from all of you.

69
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,900
And also...

70
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,500
You...

71
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,780
I recovered fast because I was taken
care of by the deputy monitor.

72
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,460
[I think I really fell in love with her.]

73
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,540
[Should I find a chance to
let her know my feelings?]

74
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,100
[Yes, after all sooner or
later she will know.]

75
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,380
[But she is a guy now,
I can't tell her directly.]

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,420
[Looks like I can only give hints to her.]

77
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,220
Urgent notice.

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,220
The replacement test for Introduction to
Sports Science is held next Monday.

79
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,460
Here's the list of students
who will re-sit the exam.

80
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,780
Wen Bing, Shen Wei Lian,
Sang Tian, Xiao Xiao.

81
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,460
These students...

82
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,980
please do your revision
during your holidays.

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,820
If you can't pass this test again,

84
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,340
don't take part in
the University Ice Hockey League.

85
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,909
Be a backup player then.

86
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,220
What should I do?

87
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,360
If we can't pass, we can't even take part
in the University Ice Hockey League.

88
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,240
This...

89
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,700
Shen Wei Lian...

90
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,020
Shen Wei Lian!

91
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,380
What are you doing?
Why are you daydreaming?

92
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,800
What did Coach Ma say just now?

93
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,420
If we fail, we can't take part in the
League and have to be back up players.

94
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,300
You didn't even listen properly,
so stupid.

95
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,700
I have an idea.

96
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,020
You all helped me
to repair my car the last time.

97
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,660
I will help you all by giving extra
lessons this time. How is it?

98
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,700
Huang Hao Ran's idea is good.

99
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,860
We can help each other,
learn together...

100
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,220
and even have a one to one guidance.

101
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,860
The problem is we have too many
people and the dorm is too small.

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,980
Forget about it then.

103
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,220
No, it's easy.

104
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,140
I'll book a suite for you all.

105
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,620
Very expensive, but you are rich.

106
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,380
Shen Wei Lian, are you crazy?

107
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,820
It's too wasteful to study in a suite.

108
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,420
Then, shall we go to your dorm instead?

109
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,940
No need.

110
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,860
I have a place.

111
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,060
We don't need to spend money
and it's spacious.

112
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,460
Where? We don't need to spend money
and it's spacious?

113
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,660
I don't know.

114
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,220
This is so luxurious.

115
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,820
Oh my god.

116
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,580
-So beautiful.
-Really different.

117
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,100
We still have to rely on
our class monitor during a crucial time.

118
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,900
This is my uncle's studio,
I borrowed it from him for a day.

119
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,180
Let's study, everyone.

120
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,300
-Good place.
-So comfortable.

121
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,940
Look at this sofa, it's so soft.

122
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
[We can use the wine bottle
to separate into groups.]

123
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,220
[Then, Sang Tian and I
can be in the same group.]

124
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,140
Why not study in groups?

125
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,020
Let's split into groups
by spinning the bottle.

126
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,620
They have formed their own groups.

127
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,060
-Why not both of us pair up?
-All right.

128
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,940
Who ordered delivery?

129
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
Me.

130
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,660
All right. Enjoy your meal.

131
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,260
How much is this?

132
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,660
I don't remember. Someone gave it to me.

133
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,540
Come, this is the coffee
I bought it for everyone.

134
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,500
-Help yourself. -You're so sweet.

135
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,380
Thanks, Wei Lian.

136
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,220
-What flavour is this? -Let me see.

137
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,830
-Come.
-I want to drink this.

138
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,160
Li He, don't snatch from me.

139
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,260
-You drink this then.
-So hot.

140
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,660
-Be careful.
-What flavour is this?

141
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,900
[I must let her know that...]

142
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,780
[I like her.]

143
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
What flavour is this?

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,300
Sang Tian,

145
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,380
I prepared this coffee especially for you.

146
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Li He, try mine.

147
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,980
I don't want to.

148
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
He doesn't drink coffee.

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,140
This is Tao Tao Jian's latte,
there's no coffee in it.

150
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,100
I think...

151
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,140
I...

152
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,020
There is still coffee inside.

153
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,860
You don't know about
Tao Tao Jian's latte.

154
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,580
How would I not know
Tao Tao Jian latte.

155
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,560
This Tao Tao Jian's latte is not for you.

156
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,200
I feel like drinking it now.

157
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,980
I bought Tao Tao Jian's
latte for Sang Tian.

158
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,620
Shen Wei Lian, thank you for
giving me Tao Tao Jian's latte.

159
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,020
Sang Tian, do you want to
drink Tao Tao Jian's latte?

160
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,160
Can I go to the washroom?

161
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,300
Over there.

162
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,460
Give it to me.

163
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,980
Let go.

164
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,900
Let's start our revision first.

165
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,540
I will go revise too.

166
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,940
-I will also...
-Huang Hao Ran...

167
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,860
can you look after your member properly?

168
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,300
Don't let him disturb Sang Tian and me.

169
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,180
Let's go Wei Lian. Let's study.

170
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,180
Let go.
Let's go.

171
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,060
Why is Wei Lian so weird today?

172
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,820
Sang Tian!

173
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,340
-Hide.
-Sang Tian.

174
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,740
Where are you?

175
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Sang Tian,

176
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,020
I bought a new cup of
Tao Tao Jian's latte for you.

177
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,460
Sang Tian.

178
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,820
Sang Tian.

179
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,620
What's wrong with Wei Lian?

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,540
You should ask yourself.

181
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,180
Ask me? How should I know?

182
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,500
Both of you snatched
my Tao Tao Jian's latte.

183
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,540
It's so weird.

184
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,480
How would I know what's
wrong with both of you?

185
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
You insisted on giving him a present.

186
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,280
Now, he has misunderstood.

187
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,300
He likes you now.

188
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,660
Didn't I explain to him that the
scarf and card are not from me?

189
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,700
And I gave him a husky toy.
What's wrong with that?

190
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,420
The present is not the main thing...

191
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,420
but he felt your sincerity.

192
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,940
Now, he's thinking of
a way to reply to you.

193
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,380
But, that time the present...

194
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,500
I just happened to see it and bought it.

195
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,820
Oh no.

196
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,740
He really misunderstood?

197
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,900
How about this black sweater?

198
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,620
It can't be that you just
happen to see it...

199
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,420
and knitted it for a few months?

200
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,580
Yes.

201
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,980
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,980
Revision.

203
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,230
You only know about revision.

204
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,660
It is better that you
don't talk like before.

205
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,560
Why are you so annoying
today? It's very disturbing.

206
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,240
But what if you fail?

207
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,100
Fail means fail.

208
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,340
No big deal.

209
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,860
At most, I won't join the match.

210
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,540
I don't care.

211
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,910
Xiao Xiao.

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Li He, what's wrong with both of you?

213
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,710
Three years of knowing each other...

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
this is the first time
he got so angry at me.

215
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
During the first year of high school,

216
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,020
I transferred school and
we were in the same class.

217
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,780
At that time, no one in the class
wanted to play with me.

218
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
They called me Little Dumb.

219
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,700
[Little Dumb.]

220
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,120
-[You can't hear that I'm calling you?]
-[Catch.]

221
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,460
[You're deaf or blind?]

222
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,980
[How dare you hit me?]

223
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,980
D[o you believe that
I'll tell the teacher?]

224
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,940
[Pass the ball.]

225
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,000
[You started it first. If there's
punishment, you will be the first one.]

226
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
[Four-eyed boy!]

227
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,700
[Who are you?]

228
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,320
[None of your business, Big Horn.]

229
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,000
[I remember last Wednesday,]

230
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,540
[a student in the girl's toilet...]

231
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,160
[Enough.]

232
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,780
[You're great. Let's go.]

233
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,240
[Here you go.]

234
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,120
[Thank you.]

235
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,060
[Don't have to care about
what others say.]

236
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,660
[Little Dumb or Big Horn,
it's no big deal.]

237
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,380
[That's what they think about us.]

238
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,420
[As long as we do our best,
it will be fine.]

239
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,300
[Isn't it right?]

240
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,780
[Next time, I will be your friend.]

241
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,140
[You don't like to talk and
I like people who'd listen to me.]

242
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,320
[Come. Is it okay?]

243
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,020
[How much did you get?]

244
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,630
[57.]

245
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,550
[57 is already a very high score.]

246
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,110
[Three more marks to pass.]

247
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,910
[57 and 43,
isn't it a hundred marks?]

248
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,070
[Both of us got a hundred marks.]

249
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,230
[A hundred marks.]

250
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,150
[A hundred marks.]

251
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,830
[Let's go and eat.]

252
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,990
I'm envious of you.

253
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,990
Since young,

254
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,350
I have not met any friends like this.

255
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,870
He said before that we will be good
friends forever and never fight.

256
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,910
I think Xiao Xiao might
have some problems today.

257
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,030
If not, he will not get angry
at you for no reason.

258
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,310
Yes.

259
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,270
You said before that...

260
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,070
you have a low blood sugar level, right?

261
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,030
So, he will bring medicine
with him every day.

262
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,110
I know what to do.

263
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,470
Oligosaccharides are from the condensation
of two to ten monosaccharide molecules.

264
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,830
The simplest form of
oligosaccharide is a disaccharide.

265
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,750
The most common
disaccharide is sucrose,

266
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,710
maltose and lactose.

267
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,270
They can be broken down
into monosaccharide by water.

268
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,910
Drinks that are suitable for athletes
are oligosaccharides...

269
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,870
that usually have four
to ten glucose units.

270
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,860
What are you doing?!

271
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,150
You only started studying for a
few minutes and you're sleepy?

272
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,730
Because I'm a special student.

273
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,930
I lack the sleeping element.

274
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,930
Moreover, this place that you
chose has sufficient sunlight.

275
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,490
It is a very suitable place to sleep.

276
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
You only know how to
eat and sleep every day.

277
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,220
You are the reincarnation of a pig.

278
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,610
You're a pig.

279
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,020
Ti amo.

280
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,420
Ti amo.

281
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,700
What did you say?

282
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,380
Ti amo.

283
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,660
I scolded you a pig
and you're still happy?

284
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
Do your revision properly.

285
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,340
I'm going to get something.

286
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,880
There is nothing that I like.
What's wrong?

287
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,599
Xiao Xiao, something bad happened.

288
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,740
Li He...

289
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,599
What's wrong with him?

290
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,200
He fainted because of low blood sugar.

291
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,540
What's wrong?

292
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,220
Li He, you must be safe.

293
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,580
You must be safe.

294
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
Li He...

295
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,660
Ouch.

296
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,760
You lied to me again.

297
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,140
Xiao Xiao...

298
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,350
Is it because of the previous match?

299
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,460
Didn't I tell you before,

300
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,960
there's no me or you in a match.
There's only us.

301
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,660
I always can't keep the goal and
dragged you guys down.

302
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
I rather not have "us".

303
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,100
So you want to give up the test and
don't want to join the match, right?

304
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,660
All of you need a qualified goalkeeper.

305
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,740
That person is not me.

306
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,620
43 and 57.

307
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,980
So what if it's a fail?

308
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,820
After adding together, it's full marks.

309
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,860
We are a hundred marks.

310
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,620
Yes. We are a hundred marks.

311
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,480
So, both of you are here.

312
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,880
I only slept for a while,
why did you hit me?

313
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
Sang Tian, if you're tired,

314
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,140
I can accompany you for a walk.

315
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,340
I can take a break too.

316
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,300
Wei Lian is right.

317
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,580
You should go and take a rest.

318
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,860
Why did you wake me up?

319
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,620
Sang Tian, I'll accompany you.

320
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,260
Why are you pulling me?

321
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,580
Why are you disturbing me?

322
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
Who is disturbing you?

323
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,300
Do you want an extra lesson from me?

324
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,540
You think Huang Hao Ran is not good
but you don't know how to tell him?

325
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,420
All right. I will teach you.

326
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,460
What...

327
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,940
My neck...

328
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,540
Do this test.

329
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,730
After you're done, I will
know what you don't know.

330
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,540
This is too much.

331
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,900
All right. I will do it.

332
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,620
Wen Bing and Wei Lian are so weird today.

333
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,660
I was resting just now but
why must they wake me up?

334
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,940
Where should I go now?

335
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,140
I just think that
this logo looks familiar.

336
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,340
Where did you buy it?

337
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,580
This is a brand from a Northern European
designer, Wellington Brown.

338
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,860
Every time I go there, I will get a few.

339
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,340
[Baidu]

340
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,980
There's no such brand.

341
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,340
Does it mean he has been lying to me?

342
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,660
Then, this umbrella...

343
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,860
He was the one who left it for me?

344
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,820
It turns out that the Black Umbrella
Rider has been by my side.

345
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,100
All right. Thank you.

346
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,260
Goodbye.

347
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,900
You...

348
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,220
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,180
-I'm sorry.
-Are you all right?

350
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,160
-It's you.
-Hi.

351
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,460
Give him another pack of milk. It's on me.

352
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,340
It's okay.

353
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,740
A discounted milk doesn't cost much.

354
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,020
All right. Walk slowly then.

355
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,980
Oh my...

356
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,700
But my watch...

357
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,460
I can't just let it be.

358
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,660
Watch? What do you mean?

359
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
You spoilt my watch
when you banged into me just now.

360
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,160
No way.
Did I hit you in such a big area?

361
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,020
Let me see.

362
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,280
What do you want to see?
Don't want to pay back right?

363
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,680
-No.
-Let me tell you.

364
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,720
This watch is...

365
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,940
Is what?

366
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,980
It's...

367
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,420
This was the only thing my sister
gave it to me before she left.

368
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
Come.

369
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,580
Don't be sad, kid.

370
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,440
It was destroyed by you.

371
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,900
Sister is already gone...

372
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,140
Who are you calling sister?

373
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,940
No. I meant the remnant of your sister.

374
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,360
I must pay.

375
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,600
Tell me how much is it?
I promise to repair it for you.

376
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,500
Money?

377
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,690
You know that family relationship
is priceless, right?

378
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,180
Family relationship is priceless.

379
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,580
You scared me.

380
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,260
But...

381
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,940
you didn't do it on purpose.

382
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
-Forget about it.
-All right.

383
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,140
I will give you a discount. 9500 dollars.

384
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,820
How much? 9500 dollars?

385
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,160
-Let me see your watch.
-Cheng Min Jun.

386
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,020
I also want to see what
watch that costs 9500 dollars.

387
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Are you not afraid that your sister
will come back and find you?

388
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,740
Chen Chen,

389
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,140
-You're so pretty today.
-Is there any day that I'm not pretty?

390
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,380
You're pretty every day.

391
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,460
I didn't mean that.

392
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,740
I don't care what do you mean.

393
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,420
But this priceless watch...

394
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,020
9500 dollars?

395
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,340
Rolex?

396
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,140
A combination of both
Rolls Royce and Rolex?

397
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,820
Limited Edition. Let me see.

398
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,260
Chen Chen, why did you debunk me?

399
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,620
You knew it is Rosdenton.

400
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,820
You...

401
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,900
How can you use a fake watch
to cheat an honest man like me?

402
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,260
Check CCTV. Report police.

403
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,540
Brother, forget about it.
It was a misunderstanding.

404
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,560
-Misunderstanding.
-No.

405
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,920
-Let go of him.
-Don't care about him.

406
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:26,220
-Let's go on a date.
-Date?

407
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,060
I'm done. I want to go to the washroom.

408
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,060
Sit down.

409
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,580
You haven't finished.

410
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,500
No, what do you mean?

411
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,540
Why are you stopping me
from finding Sang Tian?

412
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,700
Why do you want
to find Sang Tian?

413
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,860
Of course, there is something
I want to tell her.

414
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,220
What do you want to tell him?

415
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,660
He already has someone in his heart.

416
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,740
It's not good that you
keep bothering him.

417
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,060
[You this dumb boy...]

418
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,580
[Xiao Rou is just a replacement.]

419
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,980
[Both of them are sisters.]

420
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,580
I'm lazy to explain to you.

421
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,460
-Give it to me.
-No.

422
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,560
Chen Chen,

423
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,040
why did you go on a date with him?

424
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,960
Why didn't you go on a date with me?

425
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Hello?

426
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,040
[I just broke up.]

427
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,400
Don't cry.

428
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,360
Where are you now? I'll look for you.

429
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,440
Come.

430
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,800
-Come.
-Here're your grilled skewers.

431
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I didn't expect both of us
to break up on the same day.

432
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,040
Don't be sad.

433
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Our senior doesn't like you.

434
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,480
She has...

435
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,760
She doesn't have good taste. No luck.

436
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,120
I didn't expect that you're the one
who understands me the most in this world.

437
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,280
Come.

438
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,680
But why did you always meet bad guys?

439
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,320
Cheng Min Jun, say it properly.

440
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,520
Who is the bad guy?

441
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
Your gym coach.

442
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,720
He complained that you're old
and ugly.

443
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,800
Don't talk nonsense.

444
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,040
He cares and loves me too much.

445
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,920
He wants to see...

446
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,880
my true self.

447
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,720
He is not a bad guy.

448
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,320
You're a bad guy.

449
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,040
There are so many people
you can fall in love with,

450
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,320
but you fell in love with a tomboy.

451
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,880
She is not a tomboy.

452
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,880
Chen Chen is the most gentle
and cutest girl in this world.

453
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,880
Good.

454
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,800
She is the most gentle girl in the world.

455
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,240
Is it okay that I'm a tomboy?

456
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,600
You're still talking for her.

457
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,560
Why are you so obsessed?

458
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,960
It's useless that I'm obsessed with her.
She doesn't like me.

459
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
She likes that pretty boy.

460
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,920
What's good about that pretty boy?

461
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,720
-Yes.
-He wears golden frame glasses.

462
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,240
He looks like a bad guy.

463
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,080
He's definitely not a good guy.

464
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,990
Sorry.

465
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,640
Tian Tian, is it really him?

466
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,440
I'm just guessing.
I'm not sure.

467
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
How can you not be sure?

468
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,680
It is exclusively for the Wen family.

469
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,920
The Black Umbrella Rider
must be Wen Bing.

470
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,600
Cannot be his uncle, right?

471
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
It's possible.

472
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,000
That's impossible.

473
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,380
Sang Tian, the problem that you're
facing now is very serious.

474
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,280
What problem?

475
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,320
How come you don't understand yet?
Wen Bing likes you.

476
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,840
Sang Tian.

477
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Sang Tian.

478
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,720
Sang Tian.

479
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
"Titanic Revised Edition"

480
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,480
Why? Do you want to date me for a movie?

481
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
Who wants to date you?

482
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,440
You dare not admit it?

483
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,320
True.

484
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,040
It is a bit embarrassing to for a man
to date another man for a movie.

485
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,880
Especially, when it's such
a sappy love movie.

486
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,240
-Give it back to me.
-No.

487
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,600
Give it back to me. You...

488
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,760
I can give it back to you.

489
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,160
But don't always disturb me.

490
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,400
I already have someone that I like.

491
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,200
[He has someone that he likes.]

492
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,480
[Xiao Rou's words are not trustable.]

493
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,560
I also have someone that I like.

494
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,280
Sang Tian, you're back.

495
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,400
Do you have time to watch
a movie this weekend?

496
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,920
It's not good for you to do that.

497
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,360
I've just rejected you and now
you want to date other people.

498
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,520
-No.
-We're going to sleep now. Good night.

499
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,080
What did Wei Lian say just now?

500
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,640
You have makeup exam tomorrow,

501
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,040
but you were not studying in the hostel.
Where did you go?

502
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,120
I went to Xiao Rou's milk tea shop.

503
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,320
So loving.

504
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm really jealous.

505
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,080
You have someone that you like, right?

506
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,280
Why? Only you can be in love?

507
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,400
I didn't say that I don't agree.

508
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,800
It's okay that you have
someone that you like.

509
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,760
But, I haven't confessed to her.

510
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
I don't know whether she'll agree.

511
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,240
Then, I wish you success.

512
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,000
Thank you.

513
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,720
Don't talk to me anymore. I'm sleepy.

514
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,200
Are you all right?

515
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,720
Can you not come here
so late next time?

516
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
My shop is closed.

517
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm sorry.

518
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,880
Then, I'll go first.

519
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,640
Why are you here?
Did something happen?

520
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,920
You look unhappy today.

521
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,320
Did you fail in your confession?

522
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,040
How did you know?

523
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
You told me, right?

524
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,560
You like a girl who is
treating you as a friend.

525
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,240
I've tried many times.

526
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
But, she doesn't seem to...

527
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,600
understand me.

528
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,600
Liking someone is an upright
and a beautiful thing.

529
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,520
You can just tell her frankly.

530
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,640
If you're shy,

531
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,440
you can bring her to a private place...

532
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,160
that belongs to only both of you.

533
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,760
You ask me to bring her to...

534
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,240
What are you thinking?

535
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,680
I mean, you can bring
her to the theme park.

536
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,240
Take a Ferris wheel ride.

537
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Or you can go to a coffee shop
or a fine dining restaurant.

538
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,760
So you meant that.

539
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,680
If not, what did you think
I was talking about?

540
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,720
Nothing.

541
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,880
Okay.

542
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,640
Thank you for saving me.

543
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,360
So, your milk tea will be on me today.

544
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,680
Original milk tea?

545
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,240
If you can't pass your exam...

546
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,880
don't enter my milk tea shop anymore.

547
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,280
Trust me.

548
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,080
Thank you for your milk tea.

549
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,920
Keep it up in your exam.

550
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,920
I'll leave first.

551
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Study well.

552
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,280
Bye.

553
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,239
[He]

554
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
[Who does he like?]

555
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,159
I'm announcing the result
of the makeup exam.

556
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,640
Everyone has passed.

557
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,680
Everyone can take part in
the University Ice Hockey League.

558
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,240
-We're really good.
-No one is left behind.

559
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
Okay, be quiet.

560
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,440
I still have something to announce.

561
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
The school has decided to have...

562
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,720
Wen Bing from our Ice Hockey department...

563
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,120
and Meng Na from Figure Skating Department
represent the respective teams...

564
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,120
to shoot the school promotion photos
tomorrow afternoon.

565
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,120
Wen Bing.

566
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,240
This matter is related to the image...

567
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,640
and reputation of Ice Hockey Department
and Liuye Sports University.

568
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,960
You have to be well prepared.

569
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,680
You're great.

570
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
When did that happen?

571
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,000
Both of you are really a perfect match.

572
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,000
You're right.

573
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,480
Prince Bing and Princess Na Na.

574
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,520
What a perfect good looking match!

575
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,880
Yes.

576
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Correct.

577
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,760
[Could Meng Na be the one he likes?]

578
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,320
Okay.

579
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,760
You're right.

580
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,920
Sang Tian.

581
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,880
You have passed the makeup exam.
Aren't you planning to treat me to a meal?

582
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,480
I'm meeting Xiao Rou.

583
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,160
Next time.

584
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,600
Let's eat together, Sang Tian.

585
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,840
Next time.

586
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
Wen Bing, let's go to eat together.

587
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,880
Forget it. I have a date too.

588
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,040
He left too.

589
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Why do all of you have a date?

590
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,600
Only the four of us eating together?

591
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,240
Wei Lian.

592
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
Where are you going?

593
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,480
-I...
-Shen Wei Lian.

594
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,800
Do you have a date with someone too?

595
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,800
Don't pretend to be busy if you're single.

596
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Let's eat together.

597
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,120
Let's eat together.

598
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,920
Think of what to eat.

599
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,240
This item is not bad.

600
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,280
Let's have a look.

601
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,360
-Oh my god.
-The one downstairs looks good.

602
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,480
The one downstairs looks good.
Let's have a look.

603
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,760
Na Na.

604
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,800
We've bought so many things.

605
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,880
I can't carry it anymore.

606
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
But, I still don't know
what to wear tomorrow.

607
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,440
I'm still not very satisfied
with these clothes.

608
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,480
Let's go around again.

609
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
It's just a shooting
for promotional photos,

610
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,720
not a wedding photoshoot.

611
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,640
I'll shoot it sooner or later.

612
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,040
This is just a rehearsal.

613
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
But, I can't take it easy.
I have to be serious.

614
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,600
But, I think clothes are not
the most important thing.

615
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,160
Because you look good in anything.

616
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,600
What is the most important then?

617
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
Spending personal time together.

618
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,960
The photoshoot tomorrow will take
place at the theme park, right?

619
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,760
You should go for a date
after the shoot, right?

620
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,120
Merry-go-round.

621
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,360
Ferris wheel and others.

622
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,480
Yes.

623
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,160
Thank you, Li Sa.

624
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,640
I'll go back and make a plan now.

625
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,200
Wait for me.

626
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,680
Come, sit here.

627
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,040
Manager, the computer has died.

628
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,240
Number 13 top-up.

629
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
[Sadness princess,]

630
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,600
[you're finally online.]
[Do you want to play a while with me?]

631
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,520
[No.]

632
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,520
[I think I'll not play lately.]

633
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,080
[Why?]

634
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,480
[Because I'm not sad anymore.]

635
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,280
[I'm going to the theme park
with my dream guy...]

636
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,520
[for a promotional photoshoot tomorrow.]

637
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
[It must be a romantic date.]

638
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,080
[I'm already emotional
when I think about it.]

639
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,760
[You won't understand my feelings.]

640
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,120
[I'm leaving. Bye.]

641
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,200
She married me in the game.

642
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,240
How can she change her profile picture
to something like that?

643
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,680
And she wants to date with
my future brother-in-law?

644
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,720
You continue your daydream.

645
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,320
Let's see how I settle this.

646
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,000
[The school has decided to have...]

647
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
[Wen Bing from our
Ice Hockey Department...]

648
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,470
[and Meng Na from Figure
Skating Department...]

649
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,480
[represent the
respective teams...]

650
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,670
[to shoot the school promotion photos
tomorrow afternoon.]

651
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,520
[Will he confess to Meng Na...]

652
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,920
[during the shooting of
school promotion photos?]

653
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,440
How come you're alone?
