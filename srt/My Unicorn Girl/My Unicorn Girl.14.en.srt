[My Unicorn Girl]

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,080
[Episode 14]
[Just a serious medical experiment]

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
[Why can't I pass through?]

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,600
[I don't believe it.]

6
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,750
You're going against me with your body?

7
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,150
Again.

8
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,720
Wei Lian.

9
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,590
You act like a tortoise, hiding yourself
when you lost the competition.

10
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,720
Is this all you could do?

11
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,710
Yes.

12
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,440
This isn't the first day you know me.

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,920
That was all I could do.

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,790
Moreover, I'm going to be expelled
by the school.

15
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,200
I need to rest...

16
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,990
and save my energy to move my luggage.

17
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Move your luggage?

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,090
Do you know Sang Tian has challenged
your brother because of you?

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,320
Sang Tian is going
to challenge Shen Qiao Di?

20
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,430
Is he crazy?

21
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,590
I think he's crazy.

22
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,230
Because of a cowardly friend like you,

23
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,190
he went to torture himself.
I think it's not worth it.

24
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,650
[Rather than wasting time
to think about other's weaknesses,]

25
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,710
[why don't you think
about your advantages?]

26
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,560
Sang Tian.

27
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,980
Wei Lian, why are you here?

28
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,709
Let me do it for the next ten minutes.

29
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,430
Okay. fighting.

30
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,030
Do you still want to play?
Haven't you lost enough?

31
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,630
Since when I was young, whenever I see you,

32
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,550
I'll become careful...

33
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,110
because I'm afraid of losing,

34
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,680
and you'll look down on me.

35
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,790
But, now I understand.

36
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,430
If I don't have the courage
to face and challenge you,

37
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,750
why will you need to look up to me?

38
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,870
Maybe after our challenge,
I'll look down on you more.

39
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,550
Stop talking, come on.

40
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
fighting, Wei Lian!

41
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,800
Wei Lian.

42
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,480
Your skills are bad,

43
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,590
but you're lucky to have two good friends.

44
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,230
I'm leaving.

45
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,280
Bear with it.

46
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,230
Let me do it.

47
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,070
Will you talk indistinctly in the future?

48
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,169
Sang Tian.

49
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm sorry.

50
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,210
I disappointed you again.

51
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,130
At the end of the competition,

52
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,210
I didn't even score a goal.

53
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,650
You didn't lose.

54
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,850
You won over yourself.

55
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,170
Sang Tian, thank you.

56
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,530
We're good friends.

57
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,730
Sang Tian.

58
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,410
My brother told me
that I have two good friends.

59
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,010
One of them is you,

60
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,890
then who's the other one?

61
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,650
Two?

62
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,090
It's Wen Bing.

63
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,250
Senior Miao Miao.

64
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,290
Why would it be him?

65
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,130
That person only stays
in his dorm every day.

66
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,210
He left when he lost the competition.
He wasn't sincere at all.

67
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,010
His brother is Shen Qiao Di.

68
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,530
Do you think he'll accept any challenge?

69
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,050
[You won't be going to
the challenge today, right?]

70
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,130
[Of course.]

71
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,290
[Why would I waste my time on him?]

72
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,090
[Can I place a bet with you?]

73
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,050
[Look at you, are you sure?]

74
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,130
[I'm getting better.]

75
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,160
[If I win,]

76
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,770
[you'll have to go.]

77
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
[You can't break the promise.]

78
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,730
So, it's him.

79
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,090
Since you know the reason now,

80
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,170
I'll tell you another secret.

81
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,210
What secret?

82
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,090
Guess who's that person
who claimed to be Wen Bing's fan...

83
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,090
and gave Xiao Xiao
Qianbei's strategy tips?

84
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,090
No wonder he didn't come
to the skating rink...

85
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,320
to guide our practice.

86
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,210
Turns out he went to Qianbei University.

87
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,970
I misunderstood him.

88
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,690
[Why aren't they back yet?]

89
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,610
[Isn't the competition over?]

90
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,850
I heard from Miao Miao that you really
went to challenge Shen Qiao Di?

91
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,890
Why are you so foolish?

92
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,450
Don't you know yourself?

93
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,620
Yes.

94
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,170
I'm overconfident.

95
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,690
But, I'm not like someone,

96
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,650
pretending to be his own fan.

97
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,250
Wen Bing, what do you call such a person?

98
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,090
Who did such a ridiculous thing?

99
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,290
You don't know...

100
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,010
this person.

101
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,650
He's my friend.

102
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,970
Previously,

103
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,730
I always thought of him as a White Lotus.

104
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,570
He pretended to be nice and friendly,

105
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,330
but he is full of tricks.

106
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,210
After that, I think...

107
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,530
he's naughty.

108
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,290
He seems cold,

109
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,930
but actually, he's a paper tiger.

110
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,650
Do you think this person
is like a paper tiger?

111
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,970
-Who are you calling a paper tiger?
-I don't know.

112
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,970
-Paper tiger.
-Who will do this?

113
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,170
-I'm talking about someone...
-Who?

114
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,010
You...

115
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,220
[Why can I suddenly see Wei Lian clearly?]

116
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,690
Wei Lian. It isn't like that.

117
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,730
You've misunderstood, we...

118
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,930
It's fine.
I'm just here to thank Wen Bing.

119
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,690
Say something.

120
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,970
You can continue. I'm leaving.

121
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,880
Why could I see Wei Lian clearly,

122
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,210
but then became blurry again?

123
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,770
Was it because...

124
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,490
I kissed her?

125
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,370
It's ten.

126
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,450
Why isn't he back yet?

127
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,850
Whether he returns or not
isn't my problem.

128
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,130
This is the third time.

129
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,490
The first time was accidental,
the second time was a coincidence,

130
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,720
the third time must be on purpose.

131
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,810
What?

132
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
He left after kissing.

133
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,090
Wei Lian saw us.

134
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,490
How embarrassing.

135
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,650
Wei Lian.

136
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,510
Oh no.

137
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,090
Oh no.

138
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,770
Xiao Rou.

139
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,250
Something big happened.

140
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,770
You were found out?

141
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:10,890
No.

142
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,839
Wen Bing and I...

143
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,800
Did you kiss him again?

144
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,810
No, it's different this time.

145
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,670
Wei Lian saw us.

146
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,410
Wei Lian saw you?

147
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,569
What did he say?

148
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,250
He ran away.

149
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,530
Ran away?

150
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
No, Tian Tian.

151
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You must remember,

152
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,410
the boys in the school think you're a boy.

153
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,840
If they saw Wen Bing kissing you,

154
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,840
it might lead to them
finding out your secret.

155
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,120
Then what should I do now?

156
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,260
Let me think about it.

157
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,960
Okay. Tomorrow, you and Wen Bing...

158
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
should explain to Wei Lian.

159
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,200
He might overthink and talk about you.

160
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,080
What should you do then?

161
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,040
Makes sense.

162
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,560
Wen Bing.

163
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Here, sit down.

164
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,360
You're a miser. Why would you buy me food?

165
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,720
Buying you food won't
use up that much money.

166
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,240
Why are there three drinks on the table?

167
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Who else is coming?

168
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,880
Wei Lian is coming later.

169
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,640
Well, later you should...

170
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,840
explain to him about
what happened last night.

171
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,560
Speak well.

172
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
Explain?

173
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,360
About last night...

174
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,280
Sang Tian.

175
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
Wei Lian.

176
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,880
Remember to explain well.

177
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,760
Why are you here too?

178
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,040
I...

179
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,440
Say it, why did you ask me out?

180
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,880
Have a drink first.

181
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,760
Is it poisoned?

182
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,280
Of course not. Are you joking? Here.

183
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,520
Say it.

184
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,440
What?

185
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,040
About what happened last night.

186
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,540
Explain to him.

187
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,240
-Explain what?
-Well...

188
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,270
Why are you pouting to each other?

189
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,630
Wen Bing has something to tell you.

190
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,740
Tell me.

191
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,640
Say it.

192
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, Wen Bing wanted to say,

193
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
last night...

194
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
Last night?

195
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,920
About your kiss?

196
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,760
Wei Lian.

197
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,920
Last night,

198
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,760
this was what happened.

199
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
Wen Bing and I...

200
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,760
were playing around in the dorm.

201
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,320
We weren't aware that we were at the door.

202
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,840
Then, you came in and opened the door,

203
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,560
so we accidentally did that...

204
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,240
But, there's nothing going on between us.

205
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
We're just...

206
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,760
friends.

207
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,440
Am I right?

208
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,960
Say it.

209
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,080
Say it.

210
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,320
Yes, that's right.

211
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,040
[I shouldn't have asked him to come.]

212
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,640
[Useless.]

213
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,680
I thought the both of you
asked me to come for an important matter.

214
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,040
I never thought there was something
between you two.

215
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,200
Really?

216
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,080
Yes.

217
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,400
Good.

218
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,200
Wei Lian, what do you want to eat?

219
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
Should I get some for you?

220
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,960
No, I can get it myself.

221
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,450
Meal card.

222
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,040
Don't use it up.

223
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Give it to me.

224
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,640
I'll use it up.

225
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,320
Watch out for body management!

226
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,720
I'll use it up.

227
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
Why are you being like this?

228
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,120
You caused this to happen,
why did you let me explain alone?

229
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,040
Okay, I'll take note next time.

230
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
Take note next time?

231
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Will there be a next time?

232
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,240
I'm hungry.

233
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,080
I can't hear you. Drink water.

234
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm here.

235
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,680
Where are you?

236
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,240
[I'm sorry. I'll be there soon.]

237
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,280
It's fine...

238
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,560
I'll wait for you.
Girls have the right to come late.

239
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,080
What are you doing?

240
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
My hand got caught in the door!

241
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,400
Scoundrel!

242
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,640
What are you looking at?

243
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,320
Cheng Min Jun.

244
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,920
Why are you here?

245
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,240
I didn't see anything just now.

246
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,200
I didn't.

247
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,200
Just say that you saw it.

248
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
Yes, I was dumped by a scoundrel.

249
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,960
Your hand got caught in the door?

250
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,340
It's fine.

251
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,040
I have a plaster here.

252
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,960
Scoundrel.

253
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,200
Scoundrels everywhere.

254
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,760
When he heard I'm 28,

255
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,120
he suddenly became hostile.

256
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,400
He's 40 and I didn't even complain
about his age.

257
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,880
Moreover, it isn't my fault
that I look young.

258
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,920
I'm 28, I'm not old.

259
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,280
Senior Ma Chen Chen
is three months older than me.

260
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,800
Okay.

261
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,120
All right. Stop crying.

262
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay.

263
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
-I know
-Scoundrel.

264
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,800
Stop crying.

265
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,760
Enough.

266
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,120
-Scoundrel.
-Yes, I know.

267
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,800
Enough, stop crying.

268
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,720
Cheng Min Jun.

269
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,600
You should die.

270
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,800
Chen Chen, this is a misunderstanding.

271
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,120
Chen Chen, listen to me.

272
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Chen Chen? When did they
make such huge progress?

273
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,960
[Liuye Sports University]

274
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,330
Do you want a drink?

275
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,480
-No thanks. This isn't nice.
-Time to assemble.

276
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,170
Time to assemble.

277
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,760
The score wasn't ideal
for the previous competition with Qianbei.

278
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,640
But, all of you were brave.

279
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Considering your performance
for this past half-semester,

280
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,040
the following students
will enter the second team directly.

281
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,280
Enter the second team directly?

282
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,250

286
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
He's missing again.

287
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,680
Where's Huang Hao Ran?

288
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,090
Coach.

289
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,440
-Huang Hao Ran...
-Asking for leave again?

290
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,560
Next time, ask him to do it himself.

291
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,930
Yes.

Don't get excited too early.

Whether you're a mule or horse,

296
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
we'll know during next week's open game.

297
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,370
Open game?

298
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,400
Your parents can come
and watch the competition.

299
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,040
Okay, go and practice now.

300
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200

Has your mother always been abroad?

306
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
Yes.
So she won't come to my competition.

307
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,880
I know she's busy,

308
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,880
but please invite her to attend.

309
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,920
This is the first university open game
you're joining.

310
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,640
And, during the next
parent-teacher conference,

311
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,960
ask her to attend herself.

312

Yes.

Indecent?

What do you want to do?

329
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,840
Taking off the sling.

330
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,600
You can't take care of yourself?

331
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,280
Why do you need me to take off the sling?

332
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,160
Cut the crap.

333

334

Do you remember everything I said?

Even if you've recovered, you can't relax.

336
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,880
If you want to compete,
you have to be careful.

337
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,030
Don't risk your life.

338
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,520
I have something to attend to.
I've got to go.

Did you remember what the doctor told you?

340
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,600
Isn't he saying it to you?

341
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,720
It has nothing to do with me.

342
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,480
It's going to snow today.

343
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,600
Snow? What does that mean?

344
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,800
Ungrateful.

345
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,800
What do you want?

346
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,240
Don't tell me
you want me to carry you back?

347
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,760
Shorty, do you think you can carry me?

348
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,640
As if I want to.

349
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,170
What are you doing?

350
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,130
Senior Miao Miao.

351
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,570
I'm...

352
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,970
sunbathing to absorb calcium.

353
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,890
Senior Miao Miao, you're looking for me?

354
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,370
I haven't thanked you
for helping Wei Lian.

355
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,290
Their conflict wasn't resolved
after a decade.

356
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,250
Luckily, you resolved it easily.

357
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,650
I couldn't stand Shen Qiao Di
bullying Wei Lian.

358
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,490
No matter what, I'll buy you a meal.
Let's go.

359
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,410
Why is it you again?

360
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,470
Let go.

361
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,690
Miao Miao, can you give me one minute?

362
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,870
No.

363
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,080
I've said it more than 800 times,

364
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,170
I don't like you.

365
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,610
What do you not like about me?

366
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,970
Tell me, I'll change.

367
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,890
What do you like about me? I'll change it.

368
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,780
I...

369
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,530
Go on, I'll leave first.

370
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,810
We haven't eaten together yet
so you can't leave.

371
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,490
Senior, I didn't hold her hand.

372
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,890
Take it.

373
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,690
Cry if you want.

374
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,210
Don't feel ashamed.

375
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,450
I'm not an outsider.

376
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,810
Since young,

377
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,530
I've witnessed many
of your humiliating moments.

378
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,490
Don't tell me you want
to see me being humiliated?

379
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,930
What are you talking about?

380
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,690
I'm your sister.

381
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,130
Why would I want to
see you being humiliated?

382
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,930
I can't watch this anymore.

383
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,450
I want to give you some advice.

384
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,170
What advice?

385
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,400
Pursuing girls is all about strategies...

386
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,530
and taste.

387
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,250
You can't act like a fool.

388
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,730
Saying "I like you" and gifting 99 roses.

389
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,770
Are you a country bumpkin?

390
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,810
Then, what should I do now?

391
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,810
Miao Miao refused to talk to me.

392
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,690
Retreat in order to advance,
play the cat and mouse game.

393
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,410
What do you mean?

394
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,570
The most important part
when pursuing girls...

395
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,050
is keeping your distance.

396
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,650
If you go closer,

397
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,450
she'll be afraid and annoyed.

398
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,970
If you stay a distance,

399
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,090
she'll come to you and flirt with you.

400
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,890
This is known as...

401
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,370
just be aloof.

402
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,490
You're a girl, where did you learn
all this nonsense?

403
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,390
[Kidney Injury]

404
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,130
Retreat in order...

405
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,780
No.

406
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,090
Na Na.

407
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,580
Come.

408
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,690
Tell me.

409
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,730
Are you dating someone?

410
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,810
Is it Wen Bing?

411
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,040
Let me tell you,
if it's Wen Bing for real,

412
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,010
no matter where he goes,

413
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,770
I'll find him and choke him to death.

414
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,610
Do you want to pursue Senior Miao Miao?

415
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,570
Yes.

416
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,210
Then, stop nagging.

417
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,890
Take notes in your notebook.

418
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,570
Teacher Na Na will
give you a lesson today.

419
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,850
Okay. Yes, teacher.

420
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,010
I don't have a notebook.

421
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,210
I'll take notes using my phone.
You can begin.

422
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,610
Looks like I can study...

423
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,610
how to carry out
this serious medical experiment.

424
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,900
Something's wrong.

425
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,370
Why is he acting weird today?

426
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,610
He asked me to go to the clinic,

427
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,370
then stopped talking to me.

428
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,090
What is he doing?

429
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,179
This isn't right.

430
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,050
He must be hiding something from me.

431
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,730
Wen Bing.

432
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,690
Wen Bing, wake up.

433
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,970
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

434
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,330
[No, this seems familiar.]

435
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,850
[I nearly fell into his trap.]

436
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,950
You woke up?

437
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,050
Lie down, don't move.

438
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,300
It was too serious.

439
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,790
I have to press
at least five centimeters deep.

440
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,150
That wasn't counted. Let's do it again.

441
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,470
That's too hard.

442
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,030
I can't do it.

443
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,350
Should I send you to the hospital?

444
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,070
I have something else to attend to,
I have to go.

445
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,830
Are you okay?

446
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,510
Do you want to go to the hospital?

447
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,310
Luckily I escaped quickly.

448
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,990
You're always bullying me.

449
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,950
Today, it's my turn.

450
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,790
Shower and sleep.

451
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,910
Are you okay?

452
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,840
I'm fine.

453
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,910
You're fine?

454
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,230
You drew so many drawings,

455
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,510
but you say you're okay?

456
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,110
I'm really fine.

457
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,790
Oh no.

458
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,390
Oh no.

459
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,710
You're doomed.

460
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,430
What?

461
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,870
You're in love.

462
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,670
You fell for her.

463
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,510
Really? Did I guess it correctly?

464
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,640
Leave.

465
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,510
Fine.

466
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,670
You don't like her.

467
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,070
You kissed her to cure your eyes.

468
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,070
It was a serious medical experiment, okay?

469
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,020
Sang Tian.

470
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,350
Wen Bing.

471
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,910
He's showering.

472
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,550
Let me charge my phone.

473
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,150
[Sang Tian is a girl?]

474
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,030
She's a girl?

475
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,150
[I'm sorry, let me wipe it.]

476
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,720
[No need. I'll do it myself.]

477
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,300
[Why don't you take off your clothes?
I'll wash it for you.]

478
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,230
[I said, no need.]

479
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,310
Why was I that foolish?

480
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,910
Why didn't I realise it?

481
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,270
This isn't right.

482
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,390
She's a girl,

483
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,830
why would she pretend to be a boy...

484
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,350
and join Liuye Ice Hockey department?
