[Portraits that can't be pieced together]

4
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,050
You like me.

5
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,330
She looks exactly like me.

6
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,330
She's also pretty.

7
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,730
Why won't you agree?

8
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,770
What's the difference?

9
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,220
Why won't you agree?

10
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,350
If you're a quadruplet...

11
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,990
and your siblings look the same,

12
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,710
do I have to like them all?

13
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,550
Well, that wasn't what I meant.

14
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,930
I like you...

15
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,410
not because of your appearance or looks.

16
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,610
Whether you're pretty or not.

17
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,009
I don't care.

18
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,289
I just like you.

19
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,460
Well, some things can't be forced.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,220
I'm sleepy.

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,520
I'm going to bed.

22
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,140
Good night.

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,020
Go to bed early.

[but I do.]

be honest and true.]

[I don't care.]

34
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,620
[I have to tell him now...]

35
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,860
[that I'm a girl...]

36
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,960
[and I like him too.]

37
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,860
Wen Bing, I have something to tell you.

38
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,180
What?

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,740
You've made your decision?

40
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,900
No, I'm going to talk about...

41
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,180
something else.

42
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,940
About what?

43
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,900
That you have a girlfriend...

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,620
so you can't accept me?

45
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,579
It's fine, I don't mind.

46
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,940
I want to be your boyfriend.

47
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,940
Actually,

48
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,660
there's something I've been hiding
from you.

49
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,260
Of course, I have my reasons.

50
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,780
But,

51
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,820
since you said...

52
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,220
you like me,

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,180
I think...

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,579
you should know the truth
before I tell you my feelings.

55
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,940
Actually, I'm...

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,240
Actually,

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,040
you've always liked me.

58
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,980
Am I right?

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,760
I was right.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
You're here.

61
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,160
-Mum.
-Auntie.

62
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
Why are you back suddenly?

63
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,280
I have a meeting.

64
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,320
Since I'm back,

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,840
I decided to see you.

66
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,240
This time, I prepared many presents...

67
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
for your friends.

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,960
I remembered you told me...

69
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,720
Xiao Xiao likes bright things.

70
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,240
So, I bought the latest gloves for him.

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
For Shen Wei Lian,

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,040
Li He and Huang Hao Ran,

73
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,320
I bought hockey sticks for them.

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,360
Sang Tian,

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,280
I prepared a mysterious gift for you.

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,200
So, I can't let them see it.

77
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,200
Not even me?

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,800
Fine. I'll help you distribute the gifts.

79
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,480
I'll come and help you later.

80
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,840
Send my regards to your friends.

81
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,100
Okay.

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,640
Thank you, Auntie.

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,880
Auntie, you really shouldn't have.

84
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,920
Sang Tian.

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,560
I saw clearly...

86
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,880
what you did with Bing Bing in the car.

87
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,320
Auntie,

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,120
that was a misunderstanding.

89
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,159
We...

90
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,960
Is this a misunderstanding, too?

91
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,720
[You two again?]

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,480
[You can't hide from me.]

[Email: No Subject]

94
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,460
Sang Tian,

95
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,320
actually, I previously
studied in an all-girls school.

96
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,520
I was very close to a senior of mine.

97
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,520
Just like you and Bing Bing,

98
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,440
we were best friends and very close.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,680
But looking back, we were just...

100
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,520
depending on each other.

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
We were young,

102
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,440
so we turned that dependency
into attachment.

103
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,880
But, this is normal.

104
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,720
In the future, when you
find someone you really like,

105
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,440
you will realize...

106
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,160
that everything you're doing now...

107
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,600
is just the fancy of a young
and ignorant boy.

108
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,240
Auntie, it's not what you...

109
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,960
Sang Tian, you know
what I'm talking about.

110
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,840
You're a clever boy.

111
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,320
I know...

112
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,520
you'll make the right decision.

113
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,520
This is my gift.

114
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,480
Take it.

115
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,800
You'll like it.

116
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,800
-New gloves.
-New sticks.

117
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,120
I've always wanted these.

118
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,360
Looks nice.

119
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,640
-This is my grail.
-Thank your mum for me.

120
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,080
Yes, thank your mum for me.

121
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,140
It's pure carbon.

122
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
This is expensive.

123
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
-Look.
-This is great.

124
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,080
-See you, Wen Bing.
-Thank your mum for us.

125
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,720
-Thanks. See you.
-Sang Tian.

126
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
-Got to go. Bye.
-Okay.

127
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,520
Bye.

128
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,720
Bye, Sang Tian.

129
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,340
What did my mum give you?

130
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,300
Let me see.

131
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,240
Since you accepted my mum's present,

132
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,000
when will you call her mum?

133
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,680
Stop saying that.

134
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,880
Hey, what's wrong?

135
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,440
You were fine just now. What happened?

136
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
Nothing.

137
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
I...

138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,040
I was going to say...

139
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,760
that I knew you like me.

140
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,060
But, I didn't dare to say it.

141
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,080
I'm afraid if I say it,
we couldn't even be friends.

142
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
I never thought...

143
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,280
you'd confess your feelings to me.

144
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,080
I...

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
I want you to know...

146
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,640
that I don't have feelings for you.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
I never did.

148
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,280
You're kidding, right?

149
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm being serious.

150
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I hope, just like what you've said,

151
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
we can still be friends
like we've always been.

152
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,060
Tian Tian,

153
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,800
I know you're in a bad mood.

154
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,600
But what you said to Wen Bing
was kind of harsh.

155
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,960
I had no choice.

156
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
Sure you did.

157
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,640
Couldn't you tell him the truth?

158
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,620
I...

159
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,200
At first, I wanted to tell him that I'm a girl.

160
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,720
I had it all thought out.

161
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,840
If he wouldn't accept me,

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
I'd confess my feelings...

163
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,960
and wait until he forgives and accepts me.

164
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,120
But now...

165
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,760
You're afraid Wen Bing's mum
might find out you're a girl?

166
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,520
I don't know what would happen.

167
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,760
I may be expelled from Liuye.

168
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,920
I...

169
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,020
I may even not see him again.

170
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,720
If that's the case,

171
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,240
I might as well keep the secret.

172

At least now I can see him every day.

173
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,680
I can go to classes...

and practice with him.

175
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,480
It's better than not seeing him.

Tian Tian, don't think that way.

177

After all, Wen Bing is a boy,
and a kind-hearted one.

178
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,320
If you ask him out a few times,
he might get used to you.

179

Moreover, if you give him some time,

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,840
things might get better.

Recently, she encountered
an emotional problem.

is already in love with someone.

193
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,000
But two days ago, someone stole a kiss
from her at a theme park.

194

What did she do?

195
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,640
She should make a police report.

Police report?

197
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,480
She wasn't even upset.

In fact, she kept thinking
about that person.

This isn't cheating.

Even if she didn't cheat,

206

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,520
You questioned me,

339
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,840
but I didn't admit it.

340
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
[So it was him.]

341
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
[But why didn't you tell me?]

342
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,760
[What's the point in telling me now?]

343
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,240
Every drawing here is of you.

344
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,640
Sang Tian, before I met you,

345
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,080
I never drew any portraits.

346
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,040
It's not just because I can see you,

347
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,480
it's because in my heart,

348
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,480
you're special and important.

349
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,980
Do you think...

350
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,520
I should be touched?

351
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,040
I'm the only person you can see.

352
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,700
Does that mean...

353
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm more useful to you?

354
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,660
I don't care.

355
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,520
I swear to god,

356
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,140
I've never thought of using you.

357
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,280
Aren't these drawings the best evidence?

358
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Sang Tian,

359
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm used to...

360
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
not seeing other people's faces clearly.

361
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,360
Whether I can see them clearly...

362
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,900
isn't important to me.

363
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,320
As long as you're in my world,

364
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,040
as long as I can see your face
as I do now,

365
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,160
even if I have prosopagnosia
for 10 or 20 years,

366
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,080
even a lifetime,

367
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,360
I'd be happy.

368
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,600
[Just listen to me.]

369
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,160
[From now on, stay away from my son.
as far as possible.]

370
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,400
[If you fail to heed my warning again,]

371
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,720
[be prepared to pay for the price.]

372
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,000
I should've realised.

373
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,720
I should've seen your true nature
the first day we met.

374
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
You may look affectionate and gentle,

375
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,040
but deep down,

376
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
you're full of schemes.

377
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,440
I'm not special at all.

378
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,080
In this whole wide world,

379
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,680
there has to be another person
that you can see.

380
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,040
Save your drawings,

381
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,720
your unicorn...

382
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,140
and your lies of sincerity
for someone else.

383
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,960
I don't need them at all!

384
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,870
[CEO Cheng Min Li]

385
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,760
-Madam.
-How did it go?

386
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,760
Wen Bing and Sang Tian were fighting
in the studio.

387
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,340
Sang Tian is gone now.

388
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,000
What about Bing Bing?

389
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,360
Wen Bing...

390
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,100
locked himself in the studio.

391
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,280
He kept drawing, refusing to eat or drink.

392
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,480
Okay, you may leave.

393
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Madam.

394
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Don't you think...

395
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,480
this is too cruel for Wen Bing?

396
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,960
You're right.

397
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,340
I shouldn't have stopped them.

398
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,520
I should've taken him away.

399
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,880
No, Madam. That's not what I meant.

400
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,880
Better get hurt now than suffer later.

401
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
Tomorrow, go to Liuye on my behalf.

402
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,920
Yes.

403

[Sang Tian.]

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,640
[I like you.]

[I'm not special at all.]

406

[Starting today,]

409
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,060
[you must move out from your dorm,
even if it means staying on the streets.]

410
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,920
[I won't allow a girl pretending
to be a boy...]

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,640
[to stay with my son.]

412
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,920
What's wrong? You had a fight?

413
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,920
Here's an advice.

414
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,240
No women can't be jollied.

415
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,800
There're only careless men.

416
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,200
If you give up just like this,
it means she's insignificant.

417
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
Says who?

418
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,760
Then, take action.

419
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,280
Use your brain.

420
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,380
You've got her on one hand,
and your pride on the other.

421
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,000
What is pride compared to love?

422
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,720
Look at me,

423
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,840
always making a fool of myself
in front of Coach Ma. So what?

424
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,880
Think long term.

425
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,520
One day, she'll forgive me...

426
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,240
and fall for me again.

427
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,280
Okay, good luck.

428
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,000
Rest early.

429
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,880
Yes.

430
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,540
I have to take action.

431
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,120
[Liuye Sports University]

432
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,840
Her

433
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,040
You have a cold?

434
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,239
You were out all night.

435
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Where did you go?

436
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,280
I went to hang out with Xiao Rou.

437
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,239
Sang Tian,

438
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,239
I've learnt a few magic tricks.

439
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
Do you want to see?

440
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,880
I'll make a sunflower appear.

441
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,320
It is said that anyone who see
this sunflower...

442
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,280
will forget his troubles
and become happy.

443
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,639
Look, nothing in front...

444
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,840
and nothing at the back.

445
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,160
Watch the magic happen.

446
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,260
Sunflower.

447
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,640
Wei Lian...

448
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
I want to be alone now.

449
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,360
Sang Tian. We're best friends, right?

450
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,120
If anything troubles you,

451
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,100
do tell me.

452
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,400
I'll help you to solve it.

453
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm fine.

454
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,440
Sang Tian.

455
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,360
Wei Lian, I have something else to do.

456
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,520
I have to go.

457
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,920
Have a look at this document.

458
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,980
We need you to see through
Wen Bing's withdrawal.

459
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,600
The chairman wants it done quickly.

460
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,760
Yes, I know.

461
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,380
You can't go in. The chairman's busy.

462
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
You can't go in!

463
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,160
Madam, she's too strong.
I couldn't stop her.

464
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,600
Don't you know it's impolite
to barge in like that?

465
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,620
Auntie, you can't withdraw
Wen Bing from university.

466
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,720
I did everything you told me to do.

467
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,240
I didn't return to dorm.

468
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,120
I even picked a fight with him.

469
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,000
I'll cease all contact with him,
not even a word.

470
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,880
Please,

471
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,280
let him stay in Liuye.

472
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,360
I don't understand.

473
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,080
Whether he stays in Liuye or not
isn't your business.

474
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,640
Say no more.

475
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,240
I've decided...

476
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,760
to take him away.

477
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,160
You can't do this.

478
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,320
Wen Bing's dream is to play
ice hockey. He...

479
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,880
He can play ice hockey anywhere.

480
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,080
It's different.

481
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,440
How is it different?

482
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,280
Because you're in Liuye?

483
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,880
Wen Bing must stay in Liuye...

484
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,260
because...

485
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,160
Because he needs me.

486
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,640
He needs you?

487
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,640
What can you offer him?

488
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,160
I can cure his prosopagnosia.

489
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,000
What?

490
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,240
I saw Doctor Smith's medical report.

491
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,880
I'm the only one that he can see clearly.

492
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,880
Moreover, since he met me,

493
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,020
his condition has improved.

494
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,360
Sometimes, he can see others clearly too.

495
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,760
If you don't believe me,

496
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,160
you can ask his uncle.

497
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,900
Auntie.

498
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,640
Please.

499
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,400
Let him stay in Liuye.

500
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
I hope...

501
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,640
he has a chance to realise his dream.

502
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
I swear,

503
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,400
I'll keep a distance from him.

504
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,740
You really think you can do it?

505
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,480
You don't feel indignant?

506
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,600
I do.

507
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,560
But compared to him leaving Liuye,

508
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,160
not being able to realise his dreams,

509
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,240
and not being able to see
this world for the rest of his life,

510
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,840
I'd rather choose...

511
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,960
to give up my feelings for him.

512
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,600
Okay.

513
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,480
If you promise to find a girlfriend...

514
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,080
within three days and announce
your relationship,

515
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,280
I promise I'll let Wen Bing stay.

516
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,040
But Auntie, you know I'm...

517
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,280
Of course, I know you're not interested
in girls.

518
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,440
I'm just asking you to put up a front.

519
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,720
I need to see that Wen Bing
has given up on you...

520
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,080
before I'll let him stay.

521
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,800
Okay, I promise.

522
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,720
Hello, Xiao Rou.

523
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,840
Where are you?

524
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,200
[I'm having a vacation in Pattaya.]

525
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,920
[Sorry, I forgot to tell you.]

526
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
Pattaya?

527
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,880
[Yes, for my company's team building.
It's just for a few days.]

528
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,000
[Don't tell me you're already missing me?]

529
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,760
[What's wrong?]

530
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
I need a girlfriend now.

531
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,680
It's urgent.

532
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,360
[But I can't go back now.]

533
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Forget it.

534
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,500
Have fun.

535
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,060
I'll think of another way.

536
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,920
Three days?

537
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,960
Where can I get a girlfriend?

538
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,360
[Sang Tian, there's a last-minute
assembly now.]

539
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,920
Okay, I'm coming...

540
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,140
I'm sorry.

541
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,120
Senior Miao Miao, I'm sorry.

542
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,360
You think I'll let you off that easy?

543
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,480
I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry.

544
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,720
It doesn't matter.

545
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,120
I'll have to punish you.

546
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,840
What's the punishment?

547
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,080
Be my boyfriend.
