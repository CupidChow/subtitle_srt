Wen Bing.

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,990
Do you know why
I must punish Sang Tian?

6
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,470
I don't know

7
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,510
Still pretending?

8
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,550
Why didn't you tell me
when you found him being lazy?

9
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,750
-When?
-What's wrong?

10
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:38,840
I don't know.

11
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,230
-You two...
-Luckily, I was prepared.

12
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,110
If not, I would've been tricked.

13
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,950
You two are really something.

14
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,750
Getting addicted to cheating?

-Coach, we're wrong.
-Coach, we're wrong.

Full of tricks and think yourself clever.

18

Run 10 laps when you return to school.

19

Dismissed.

20

-Yes.
-Okay, coach.

21
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,900
I knew it.

Where did you two go?

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
What did you do in the woods?

24
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,750
Tell me honestly.

25
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,300
You saw the footage, right?

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,790
-Are you tired? Drink some water.
-Thank you.

It's the last 50 meters.

29

Go!

35
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,710
This is for you.

What's this?

37
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,470
Someone used to said that
I look like a husky.

38
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,750
So I give myself to you.

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,910
Of course.

the day we ate barbeque.

But it was sold out.

83
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,230
What clothes?

84
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,150

What do you think the embroidery is?

88

How would I know?

89
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,430

90

a self-portrait.

91
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,430
You're the pig.

Good morning.

Good morning.

Sang Tian? Why are you here?

106

You two know each other?

107

She tried out for
the Figure Skating Department.

108

You...

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,710
You're a girl?

110

I...

111
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,750
I'm so disappointed with you.

112
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,790
You cheated in the exam.

113
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,470
I assumed you had done it
for your friends.

114
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,680
Used tricks during practice assessment.

115
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,590
As you were helping your friends,
I didn't punish you.

116
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,970
In the end?

117
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,150
You lied to me from the beginning.

118
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,070
Coach Ma.

119
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,750
I didn't mean to lie to you.

120
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,950
I myself don’t know how
I got into the Men Ice Hockey Department.

121
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,590
Just so happen that
I had no place to stay at the time.

122
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,830
And Liuye is the place
I've been longing for.

123
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,230
So I posed as a boy
and came to the university.

124
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,030
But I really don't have bad intentions.
Coach Ma, please.

125
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,990
No need to explain.

126
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,590
A fake is a fake.

127
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,890
Wrong is wrong.

128
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,590
It doesn't matter whether
it's intentional or not.

129
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,700
You better be mentally prepared.

130
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,390
You'll be punished
and expelled from Liuye.

131
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,710
Listen here.

132
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,070
This is a huge matter.

133
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,990
Before I tell you the result,

134
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,550
you have to keep this to yourself.

135
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,910
You must not tell anyone.

136
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,670
Understand?

137
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,070
Alright, go back to class.

138
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,950
In one week,

139
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,030
you will have a three versus three
professional assessment.

140
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,830
Aside from personal ability,

141
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,990
the most important thing is
mutual assistance and teamwork.

142
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,990
Before you form your teams,

143
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,150
I believe I need to tell you
your strengths and weaknesses.

144
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,830
Shen Wei Lian.

145
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,430
Yes.

146
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,600
In the entrance and practice exams,

147
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,990
your strength is speed.
Everyone knows it.

148
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,330
However, you have poor puck control.

149
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,670
It needs work.

150
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,850
Alright.

151
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,130
Huang Hao Ran.

152
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,070
Yes.

153
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,750
Your strength is you're calm on the field.

154
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,590
You have strong judgement.

155
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,910
However, your movements
can't keep up with your brain.

156
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,510
In short, you lack power.

157
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,430
Alright, coach.

158
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,670
-Li He.
-Up.

159
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,950
Yes.

160
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,140
In short,

161
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,550
all brawn but no brain.

162
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,280
Your power is quite good.

163
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,030
I thought he's mute.

164
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,150
You don't use your brain.

165
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,530
Flexibility and adaptability are poor.

166
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,630
You're the exact opposite
of Huang Hao Ran.

167
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,230
Sit down.

168
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,110
Yes.

169
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,790
Xiao Xiao.

170
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,670
Yes.

171
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,710
Your strength is that
you have no strength.

172
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,070
Don't laugh.

173
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,710
Overall you're alright.

174
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,350
But nothing exceptional.

175
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,790
You're still far away from being
a qualified goalkeeper.

176
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,190
Wen Bing.

177
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,030
Undeniably,

178
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,910
among everyone,

179
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,710
you're the most comprehensive one.

180
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,190
Shoot, touch, speed and power.

181
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,670
You're all top-notch.

182
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,350
But you have a fatal problem.

183
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,750
Your team awareness is very poor.

184
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,150
You hardly pass the puck on the field.

185
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,990
Ice hockey is about team fights.

186
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,470
Even if you're the best player,

187
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,190
can you really keep winning
by relying on yourself?

188
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,110
Don't be naive.

189
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,910
I hope after a week,

190
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,190
I can see a new you on the field.

191
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,470
Alright, coach.

192
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,030
-Wu Zhe.
-Yes.

193
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,990
Poor speed, practice more.

194
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,950
Okay.

195
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,270
-Meng Hao.
-Yes.

196
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,110
Low stamina. Work on that, understand?

197
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,990
Yes.

198
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,110
Alright.

199
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,710
For all the problems I've said just now,

200
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,110
I hope you reflect on them on your own.

201
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,710
Also think about
who you want to team up with.

202
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,430
Who can help you improve?

203
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,870
Coach.

204
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,190
You didn't comment about Sang Tian.

205
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,710
Shen Wei Lian.

206
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,870
You will record the final groupings.

207
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,750
Give me the report this weekend.

208
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,430
-Understand?
-Yes.

209
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,110
Dismissed.

210
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,120
-Not bad.
-She didn't comment about Sang Tian.

211
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,670
This means that he's too good.

212
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,630
Yeah.

213
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,690
Wow, you're amazing!

214
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,830
I envy you so much.

215
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,380
You know what? Coach Ma
commented on everyone except you.

216
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,390
What does that mean?

217
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,030
It means that you're best overall player
in our class.

218
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,600
You're even better than Wen Bing.

219
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,430
Isn't that right?

220
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,070
Of course.

221
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,870
What's wrong?

222
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,230
You're not yourself today.

223
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,510
Nothing's wrong.

224
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,190
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night.

225
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,670
So I'm tired.

226
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,910
We're three best buddies.

227
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,430
Why are you two always
talking among yourselves?

228
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,710
What are you plotting?

229
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,270
You want to kick me out?

230
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,350
No way.

231
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,230
I don't care about the others.

232
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,870
The three of us...

233
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,630
will be a team.

234
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,910
You heard me?

235
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,470
You heard me?

236
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,430
I'll listen to him

237
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,790
Sang Tian, Wen Bing didn't object.

238
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,500
You'll say yes too, right?

239
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,830
Right?

240
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,070
I don't mind.

241
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,470
You guys chat.

242
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,950
What does he mean he doesn't mind?

243
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,870
Am I not that important?

244
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,230
[What's wrong with her?]

245
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,310
Please come again.

246
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,350
So Coach Ma and Coach Xue both know?

247
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,430
Tian Tian.

248
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,470
What are you going to do next?

249
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,150
I don't know.

250
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,630
Coach Ma...

251
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,830
wants me to keep it a secret...

252
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,950
before the punishment is confirmed.

253
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,390
Tian Tian.

254
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,270
What I'm going to say next
might be disappointing and cruel,

255
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,220
but the possibility of you
staying in the Ice Hockey Department...

256
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,870
is near to zero.

257
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,430
I know.

258
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,310
I know you can't bear to part with him.

259
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,070
I... I didn't think that.

260
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,500
Tian Tian,
you don't have to quickly deny it.

261
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,110
I just want you to know that
the most important thing now...

262
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,910
is to tell him indirectly
that you're leaving.

263
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,630
Make sure to say goodbye to him properly
before you leave.

264
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,630
You might not have time do it properly
if you wait around.

265
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,150
Wen Bing.

266
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,070
Wen Bing?

267
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,070
Luckily he's not here.

268
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,349
What's happened actually?

269
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,190
Nothing.

270
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,069
Why are you hiding from me then?

271
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,750
I didn't hide from you.

272
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,030
I bet there's something.

273
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,950
You want to move again?

274
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,750
Yes.

275
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,380
I don't want to stay with you.

276
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,230
Why must you move?

277
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,590
I...

278
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,870
think that ice hockey is boring.

279
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,110
I don't want to stay in Liuye anymore.

280
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,630
Did you lose your head somewhere?

281
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,910
What do you want to do then?

282
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,310
Figure skating, curling or sell oden.

283
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,550
Anyway, I just don't want to.

284
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,830
These are Christmas presents
for my two lovely teammates.

285
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,350
Christmas is not here yet.

286
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,030
It doesn't matter when I give it.

287
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,430
This is a 24-hour smart thermos flask.

288
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,710
This is the latest air purifier.

289
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,190
Well? Are you satisfied?

290
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,470
Do you feel the warmth?

291
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,470
Are you happy?

292
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,640
Let me join you two.

293
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,710
He's so direct. You need
to give him an answer.

294
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,830
If you don't say yes,
our dorm will be filled with his things.

295
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,030
Sang Tian.

296
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,350
-Sang Tian.
-Guess what I found?

297
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,750
I found footage of last batch's matches.

298
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,390
-I brought fried chicken.
-I brought drinks.

299
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,550
Let's watch together.

300
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,470
Come.

301
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,350
You two, come here.

302
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,030
-Come.
-Eat some, Sang Tian.

303
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,030
It's tasty.

304
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,230
I... I have something to do.

305
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,580
You guys go ahead.

306
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,110
-Hurry up and come back.
-Hurry.

307
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,630
Don't mind him. Let's eat and watch.

308
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,000
Come, eat fried chicken.

309
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,110
-Coke?
-I want Coke.

310
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,590
[Is it so hard to say goodbye?]

311
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,670
Senior.

312
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,390
What are you thinking?

313
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,310
This...

314
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,270
still needs to be taken care of.

315
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,350
Do you have any ideas?

316
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,910
Ideas?

317
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,430
How would I have any ideas?

318
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,990
This is the first time
I heard something so strange.

319
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,230
But to be honest,

320
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,460
Sang Tian is quite pitiful.

321
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,350
She finally passed the Figure Skating
professional examination...

322
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,510
but she wasn't accepted due to
one point short in the culture paper.

323
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,430
She cried and begged me that day.

324
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,670
I can see that she really wanted
to study in Liuye.

325
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,630
I nearly got swayed.

326
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,750
Why didn't you accept her?

327
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,990
I'm just a coach.

328
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,690
I don't have that much power.

329
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,150
I just want to say that...

330
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,480
she became your student by mistake.

331
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,200
This might be fate.

332
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,320
Why not...

333
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,510
you act like you don't know anything?

334
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,000
Impossible.

335
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,810
She's deceiving the school.

336
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,670
She must leave.

337
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,110
She's your student, it's your decision.

338
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,630
I won't interfere.

339
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,790
I'll go first.

340
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,030
Sang Tian.

341
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,030
Goodbye.

342
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,790
Hurry up and go.

343
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,310
Alright.

344
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,910
[A fake is a fake.]

345
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,230
[Wrong is wrong.]

346
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,140
[It doesn't matter
whether it's intentional or not.]

347
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,070
[You better be mentally prepared.]

348
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,510
[You'll be punished...]

349
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,030
[and expelled from Liuye.]

350
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,550
Where did you go?

351
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,350
I...

352
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,430
had something to do.

353
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,830
So are we grouping with Wei Lian or not?

354
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,550
Also, give some advice regarding
the simulated confrontation practice.

355
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,250
Let's talk tomorrow.

356
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,350
Okay, tomorrow then.

357
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,830
Coach Ma said I'm weak at passing.

358
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,110
Train with me.

359
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,270
They cooperate so well.

360
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,310
That's a great game.

361
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,790
It's a match made in heaven.

362
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,670
That is so great.

363
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,910
Wait, "match made in heaven"
is to describe couples.

364
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,350
They are brothers.

365
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,190
It should be called "ideal combination."

366
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,830
Yesterday, I said you're not co-operative
and didn't pass the ball.

367
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,910
I didn't ask you to practise
with Sang Tian only.

368
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,150
There are other teammates on the field.

369
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,390
Why do you only seek him out?

370
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,430
What if he's not on the field?

371
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,630
Who will you pass to then?

372
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,070
Sang Tian,
you don't need to practise today.

373
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,050
Go and rest.

374
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,790
Really?

375
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,510
The class monitor gets special treatment.

376
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,270
He can skip practice.

377
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,110
Everyone.

378
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,190
Except Sang Tian,

379
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,830
everyone will practice
with Wen Bing today.

380
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,910
Practice until he can do it.

381
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,510
Huang Hao Ran, Wei Lian.

382
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,790
Why are you standing there?

383
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,560
Wei Lian, what's wrong
with Coach Ma today?

384
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,070
She keeps picking on Wen Bing.

385
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,750
I don't know.

386
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,590
Might be relationship issues again.

387
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,510
Pass the puck to the person I call out.

388
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,230
Li He.

389
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,840
[Height, Shoulder width, Length of legs]

390
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,050
[Height, Shoulder width, Left-handed,
Length of legs]

391
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
[Height, Shoulder width, Left-handed,
Length of legs]

392
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,380
Huang Hao Ran.

393
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,400
[Condition: Nervous, Physique: Skinny,
Uniform size: XL)

394
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,670
[Strong wrists, Left shoulder shrug
11 degrees, Old left hip injury]

395
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,150
Wei Lian.

396
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,640
[Strong wrists, Left shoulder shrug
11 degrees, Old left hip injury]

397
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,200
[Strong lower and upper limbs,
Gloves size 15]

398
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,350
Quickly!

399
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,230
[Pale complexion,
Left shoulder shrug 11 degrees]

400
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,220
[Strong arm muscles,
Adequate back muscles]

401
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,830
What's wrong with him today?

402
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,310
Faster.

403
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,230
Who will wait for you
when you're on the field?

404
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,390
Huang Hao Ran.

405
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,140
[Height, Shoulder width, Length of legs]

406
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,990
Sang Tian's not playing.

407
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,630
And look how your passing is.

408
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,030
It's a mess!

409
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,790
Listen here.

410
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,910
Ice hockey is a team sport.

411
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,790
Cooperation is key.

412
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,790
If every single one of you
is like him,

413
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,350
playing only by himself,

414
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,830
what's the use of front guards?

415
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,230
Just shoot at the goal.

416
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,590
Coach Ma, I know I'm wrong.

417
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,190
I'll improve.

418
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,790
All of you go back and practise.

419
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
Dismissed.

420
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,990
Why?

421
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,670
You came to comfort me?

422
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,660
I passed the puck to the wrong person.

423
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,830
It's no big deal.

424
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,000
Coach Ma's right.

425
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,110
If you want to go further, you need to practise passing.

426
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,710
She's right?

427
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,430
It's fine if you play.

428
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,150
We cooperate so well.

429
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,670
Why must I pass the puck to others?

430
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,470
I...

431
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,790
You what?

432
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,030
You really want to leave just like that?

433
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,310
Listen here.

434
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,550
I don't care about others.

435
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,830
You're mine.

436
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,870
You have to cooperate with me
on the field.

437
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,230
Understand?

438
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,230
Why am I yours?

439
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,470
Maybe...

440
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,830
Maybe I'll leave tomorrow.
Who else can you bully then?

441
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,990
Let go.

442
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,990
Let go.

443
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,870
I'm warning you.

444
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,230
You must not leave without my permission.

445
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,110
Don't even think of leaving.

446
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,100
You said you'd give me an answer today.

447
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,230
Have you thought about it?

448
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,270
About what?

449
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,070
The grouping.

450
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,230
Although with me,

451
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,500
you can win easily...

452
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,670
but it's three versus three, not two.

453
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,270
We have to find another person.

454
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,990
Furthermore,
that Husky won't stop pestering you.

455
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,430
If you don't say yes,
he'll keep bothering you.

456
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,970
I'll think about it.

457
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,440
think about what?

458
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,980
Do you not trust him?

459
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,550
Or you don't trust me?

460
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,710
I...

461
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,270
You should go practice.

462
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,510
Coach Ma was very strict with you today.

463
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,150
-How about you?
-Me?

464
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,750
Didn't you hear what Coach Ma said?

465
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,020
I can rest today.

466
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,909
Goodbye.

467
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,280
Without my permission,

468
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,310
you must not go anywhere.

469
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,750
Why is he so oppressive?

470
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,070
Why is his bed so messy?

471
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,510
Why didn't he make his bed?

472
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,070
Why does he always find fault
with the snowman?

473
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,470
Die!

474
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,070
Kill him.

475
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,670
Go! Why are you so stupid?

476
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,030
Kill him!

477
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,150
Hit him.

478
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,790
Hit him!

479
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,430
Kill him!

480
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,950
Quick! Kill him.

481
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,670
What are you doing?

482
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,990
Go.

483
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,430
-Shoot below!
-What teammate is this?

484
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,990
-So frustrating!
-Do better, please.

485
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,430
Kill him.

486
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,340
-Idiot!
-Stupid teammate.

487
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,750
-Only Sad is reliable.
-Only Kidney Hurt is reliable.

488
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,910
Sad, you go upper road,
I'll go lower road.

489
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,790
We'll kill them.

490
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,550
Great, we should have done it earlier.

491
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,830
-Kill him.
-Good.

492
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,710
Kill him.

493
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,670
Good.

494
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,910
Come. Hit him!

495
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,190
Beautiful.

496
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,060
[Kidney Hurt wants to add you
as their friend]

497
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,700
[You're Sad, I'm Kidney Hurt.]

498
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,430
[We're the same, unlucky bunch.]

499
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,590
[Don't label me.]

500
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,830
[I'm sad because of love issues.]

501
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,150
[Why is your kidney hurt?]

502
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,670
[We're not the same.]

503
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,430
[Love issues?]

504
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,750
[Seems like you're a high school student.]

505
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,910
[It's none of your business.]

506
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,110
[None of my business?]

507
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,910
[I'm a love expert.]

508
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,990
[I specialise in dealing with
all sorts of love issues.]

509
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,540
[This is totally my business.]

510
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,830
Bragger.

511
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,030
[But I really am an expert.]

512
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,310
He doesn't know who I am anyway.

513
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,630
I guess it's fine to ask him.

514
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,550
[Let me ask you.]

515
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,150
[If a boy keeps his distance,]

516
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,990
[does it mean he doesn't like me?]

517
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,510
[Not necessarily.
It depends on the situation.]

518
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,290
[Some guys like to loosen the reins
only to grasp them better.]

519
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,590
[When you're too close,]

520
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,950
-[he'll step back.]
-[Loosen the reins to grasp better?]

521
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,070
[When you're too far,]

522
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,910
[he'll get close to you and tease you.]

523
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,070
[So keeping a distance
is not necessarily a bad thing.]

524
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,820
[It means that he's interested in you.]

525
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,980
[He's flirting with you.]

526
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,230
[Teach me then.]

527
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,110
[What should I do?]

528
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,590
[Okay. Since you're so sincere,]

529
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,310
[I'll teach you a thing or two.]

530
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,990
[Prepare a notebook.]

531
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,230
[Write it down.]

532
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,030
[Alright.]

533
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:27,230
"Top Ten Ways To Pursue
The Guy You Like."

534
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,950
Second move.

535
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,230
[Don't be clingy. Watch over him
like a secret angel.]

536
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,150
[Kidney Hurt: Never appear before him
at all times.]

537
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,150
[What's meant to be will be.]

538
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,710
[There is no escaping it.]

539
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,470
[Okay, I've made my decision.]

540
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,670
[The next moment I see him,]

541
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,110
[I'll say it out loud.]

542
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,990
[You're leaving.]

543
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,200
[Ask him to find another teammate.]

544
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,830
[Don't ruin the assessment.]

545
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,270
What are you doing?
You're so sneaky.

546
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,790
You don't reply my messages
nor answer my calls.

547
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,830
What were you doing?

548
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,790
I was resting at the dorm.

549
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,520
This is how you rest?

550
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,580
That's none of your business.

551
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,750
You messed up my clothes,
and said it's not of my business?

552
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,590
Do you have a problem with me?

553
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,990
You can just tell me directly.

554
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,030
Why do you always attack my clothes?

555
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,110
I... Right, I do have a problem with you.

556
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,270
Who do you think you are?
You keep ordering me around.

557
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,430
Clean the sheets, take the bag.

558
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,990
You think you're an oppressive CEO?

559
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,630
What a hypocrite!

560
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,750
I hate you.

561
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,550
I don't ever want to see you again!

562
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,510
Also, you and Wei Lian can get
another teammate.

563
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,910
Just find whoever, I don't care.

564
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,390
[Why is she crying?]
