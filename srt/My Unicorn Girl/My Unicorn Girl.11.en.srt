You don't understand.

173
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,600
You're single.

174
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,140
It's no wonder.

175
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,590
Women are such a hassle.

176
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,750
You have to take them shopping,

177
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,350
buy clothes for them,

178
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,260
test the colours of their lipsticks...

179
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,850
-and do manicure with them.
-Tian Tian.

180
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,280
Let's call it a day. I'm exhausted.

181
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,110
Tian Tian, what's with your eyes?

182
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,130
Women always talk in riddles.

183
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,330
She's the one who wanted to shop.

184
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,020
Yet she talks as if I'm the one
who wanted to go.

185
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,110
Allow me introduce. This is
my girlfriend, Fang Xiao Rou.

186
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,570
Hello, I am Wen Bing.

187
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,850
Sang Tian's roommate.

188
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,790
So you're Wen Bing.

189
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,970
I've heard so much about you
from Sang Tian.

190
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,850
Really?

191
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,460
Has he been saying bad things?

192
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,130
Of course not.

193
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,490
He has nothing but praises.

194
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,730
He said for a genius,

195
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,730
you're modest, humble and polite.

196
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,970
A real class act.

197
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,030
I didn't know you think so highly of me.

198
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,210
We still have some stuff to buy.

199
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,930
We've got to go.

200
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,720
See you, bye bye.

201
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,210
Tian Tian,

202
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,980
I looked at Wen Bing closely just now.

203
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,360
He is really handsome.

204
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,080
So, what do you think of my
acting skills?

205
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,370
It was too much.

206
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,490
Two more words from you
and I would be exposed.

207
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,830
No, it wasn't

208
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,330
What rotten luck.

209
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,410
The one day I go shopping as a girl,

210
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,930
and he had to turn up.

211
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,320
Is this the only shopping
mall in Qian Bei?

212
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,070
Never mind, let's just leave.

213
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,650
Tian Tian,

214
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,110
what about your "One Day As A Woman"
wish list?

215
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,350
Forget it. If we bump into him again
at the mall...

216
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,170
and he sees me doing something funny,

217
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,050
I'll never hear the end of it.

218
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,010
You're right.

219
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,580
Let's shop some other day.

220
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,290
Besides, you're my girlfriend now.

221
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,470
We can go shopping
anytime we want. Come on.

222
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,310
Tian Tian.

223
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,650
You'd better remain as a boy,

224
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,210
don't be a girl.

225
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,970
Being a girl is too tiresome!

226
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,510
Wait up!

227
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,330
Senior, notice anything different
about me today?

228
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,770
[Ice Hockey Department]

229
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,060
Yes, you guessed it.

230
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,830
Check this out, my boyfriend
paid for it.

231
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,490
Senior!!!

232
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,150
why didn't you ask me
who my boyfriend is?

233
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,090
Who?

234
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,680
Take a guess.

235
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,340
Cheng Min Jun?

236
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,190
No way he's my boyfriend.

237
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,890
He's a freeloading boy toy,

238
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,570
a miser who uses free samples as gifts.

239
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,710
I disdain him.

240
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,250
Alright, let me show you
my boyfriend's photo.

241
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,410
He's a fitness coach.

242
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,530
He's super handsome.

243
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,140
Look, isn't he handsome?

244
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,890
Isn't he?

245
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,600
Coach Ma, you wanted to see me?

246
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,570
I couldn't reach Sang Tian.

247
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,950
Inform everyone...

248
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,170
no mucking about during the mini-break
starting tomorrow.

249
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,170
We have a match against
Qian Bei next week.

250
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,890
Better rest during the holidays...

251
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,810
-and stay in shape.
-Noted.

252
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,890
Senior,

253
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,430
those kids just had a competition.

254
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,470
They should go out and have fun
during the holiday.

255
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,330
Every team in the school
is living it up...

256
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,810
except your ice hockey team.

257
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,440
I feel sorry for them.

258
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,070
Right, Hao Ran?

259
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,970
Fine.

260
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,920
Go out and frolic if you must.

261
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,370
But Wen Bing stays in the dormitory.

262
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,090
His arm is injured.

263
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,770
Who'd bear the responsibility...

264
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,370
if something happens to him?

265
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,770
Rest assured, Coach Ma.

266
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,940
We're not going anywhere,

267
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,370
at least not that I know of.

268
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,890
We'll stay in school.

269
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,330
Good.

270
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,760
Your students are so obedient.

271
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,750
Well, they are my students.

272
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,530
What?

273
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,870
You've even booked a homestay?

274
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,610
Are you surprised? Are you happy?

275
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,870
But Coach Ma specifically said...

276
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,780
no outings during the holiday.

277
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,140
Especially Wen Bing.

278
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,890
Just leave him here then.

279
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,750
He's no fun anyway.

280
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:08,650
Am I right?

281
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,329
That's kind of true.

282
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,930
But if we are all going out,

283
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,569
I feel bad leaving him here by himself.

284
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,970
But we can't just stay here
and do nothing because of him.

285
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,420
He's right. We only get one break
per semester.

286
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,640
We can't spend our holidays holed up here.

287
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,280
Besides, I've already booked the homestay.

288
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,290
Look.

289
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,610
Private room.

290
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,130
Double bed.

291
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,770
It even has a hot tub.

292
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,170
What extravagance.

293
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,090
What a fancy room.
Isn't it a pity if we stay here?

294
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,050
Yes, that's right. We must go.

295
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,310
Let me see...

296
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,090
We must go.

297
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,260
So many rooms.

298
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,750
There's even a hot tub, a yard...

299
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,450
Under the circumstances,

300
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,490
we could lie and tell him we're going...

301
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,490
Training.

302
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,690
-That's right.
-Finally, a room all to myself.

303
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,290
No more sleeping with that douche,
Wen Bing.

304
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,210
Just send someone to tell Wen Bing.

305
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,560
There's a fruit orchard.
I could go hiking.

306
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,690
It has everything I need,
and all the food!

307
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,000
All in favor of sending the deputy
monitor, raise your hand.

308
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,250
Raise your hand.

309
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,490
Sang Tian.

310
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,850
Sang Tian.

311
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,070
It's you, then.

312
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,290
What are we voting for?

313
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,210
I'll vote, too.

314
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,800
Look at the time now.
You might as well stay out.

315
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,480
What's wrong?
Did your girlfriend dump you?

316
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,790
Cat got your tongue?

317
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm so jealous of you.

318
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,810
Why is that?

319
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,290
Our mini-break starts tomorrow.

320
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,180
You can stay in the dorm and rest
for three days.

321
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,610
While I have to go for training.

322
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,390
It's so unfair.

323
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,130
Training?

324
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,500
Why am I not informed?

325
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,220
Coach decided to leave you out
since you're injured.

326
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,460
Where's the training?

327
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,610
At a tiny valley.

328
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,290
A backwater village in the middle
of nowhere.

329
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,650
Wait.

330
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,700
Are you all going to
sleep in one room?

331
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,470
No, we're not.

332
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,610
I saw the photo.

333
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,650
The lodging isn't too bad.

334
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,400
I'll even have a single room.

335
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,490
So you're going to leave me,
an injured person,

336
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,900
alone in the dorm?

337
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,770
Don't you think you should do something?

338
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,570
Of course not.

339
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,370
The training may be tough,

340
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,650
but I'd never forget my friend.

341
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,770
I'll call you every other hour...

342
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,460
to check on you.

343
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,680
Don't worry.

344
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,850
We'll be ready to depart at 9 pm.

345
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,410
-Thanks for the trouble.
-Okay.

346
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,040
Well? Is everyone here?

347
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,570
There's still Huang Hao Ran.

348
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,990
-Huang Hao Ran?
-He's not here.

349
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,490
There he is.

350
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,110
Hey guys.

351
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,330
Aren't you excited?

352
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,290
You want to stay here with Wen Bing?

353
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,690
Yeah. What's up with you?

354
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,290
Sorry for being late.

355
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,490
I brought sushi.

356
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,570
Let's eat together.

357
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,130
Sushi?

358
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,130
A pig's head.

359
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,410
A sticky note.

360
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,890
And even a lunch box.

361
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,690
Huang Hao Ran, have you
got yourself a girlfriend?

362
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,290
Imagine keeping such a big news
from us.

363
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,850
-You call yourself our friend?
-Yeah.

364
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,890
-Tell us now.
-Yeah.

365
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,210
Only someone who's in love...

366
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,850
would do such cheesy things.

367
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,730
Take it back.

368
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,970
Alright. Everyone's here.

369
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,150
Let's get in the car.

370
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,250
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

371
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,290
Come on, hop in.

372
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,370
Xiao Xiao,

373
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,820
is drawing a pig's head...

374
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,980
a sign of being in love?

375
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,370
Sang Tian, are you a relationship virgin?

376
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,850
Everyone knows that.

377
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,780
She didn't even say goodbye.

378
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,530
She's got a nerve.

379
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,970
[Wet rubbish]

380
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,770
Wet rubbish.

381
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,890
What silliness.

382
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,300
Since you made me breakfast,

383
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,290
I'll forgive you.

384
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,250
Here it is.

385
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,410
[Misty Suite]

386
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,850
This place gorgeous. Li He, look.

387
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,730
So beautiful.

388
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,210
Good choice, Wei Lian.

389
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,100
-There's even an outdoor pool.
-Awesome.

390
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,450
The internet raves about it.

391
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,890
The view here is magnificent.

392
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,290
-Look at the view.
-Yeah.

393
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,010
Wait, we haven't even taken a photo.

394
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,130
Come, Sang Tian. Let's take a picture.

395
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,650
-Come on.
-Three, two, one.

396
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,130
Let's see it.

397
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,010
-Let's see it.
-I...

398
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,050
a group without Wen Bing.
I'll post it there.

399
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,210
How is it?

400
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,890
Don't forget to block him for the next
two days. Got it?

401
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,170
-Got it.
-I've sent it to the group.

402
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,690
Block Wen Bing.

403
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,400
I look so ugly in the picture.

404
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,810
The picture is great.

405
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,370
I've done my best, okay?

406
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,810
I think it's pretty good.

407
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,890
We look natural.

408
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,050
I love that background.

409
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,020
Look at this.

410
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,210
Okay.

411
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,730
Sang Tian, let's check out the room.

412
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,610
Come on.

413
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,710
-Sure.
-Let's go.

414
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,770
Okay.

415
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,370
You're drawing still life?

416
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,090
What's this?

417
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,690
A lovingly made lunch box,
and a pig's head?

418
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,730
Is it for me?

419
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,230
Why are you so nervous?

420
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,630
Was it made specially for you?

421
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,490
Good for her.

422
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,450
She thinks about you even on her vacation.

423
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,370
What did you say?

424
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,590
This...

425
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,390
What's wrong?

426
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,370
What's wrong?

427
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,090
They look happy.

428
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,600
How dare she lie to me?

429
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,490
What?

430
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,100
Let me see...

431
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,930
What do you think?

432
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,210
Isn't it awesome?

433
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,570
But this is a triple room.

434
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,650
You said there'd be single rooms.

435
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,250
Sorry, Sang Tian.

436
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,040
The owner just told me.
The single rooms are fully booked.

437
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,090
But we can't just share a bed.

438
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,410
How would it even work?

439
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,050
You see, Sang Tian.

440
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,170
There's only four rooms
between 11 of us.

441
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,730
How should we split them?

442
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,690
Alright, then. You decide.

443
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,550
Sang Tian, how about we share a room?

444
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,850
I'll check on them.

445
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,090

I don't care how busy you are,

450
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,130
just bring me my pad within the hour.

451
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,410
I'll send the address. Bye.

Of all the times it could come...

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,550
I can't share a bed with him.

455
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,830
Where are the taxis?

456
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,690
Carpooling, cab hailing, car-on-demand,
I'll try everything.

-It's you.
-It's you.

What are you doing here? This is my ride.

460
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,120
I booked it first.

461
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,050
Please get out. I have an emergency.

462
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,250
Why should I?

463
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,470
I'm not letting you in.

-Get out.
-No.

Get out.

468
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,090
Knock it off.

469
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,410
This is a carpool.

If you're not happy, just get out.

471

Don't break my door.

472

-Yes.

There's apple, persimmon, plum, pear...

sure is scenic.

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,420
I think it belongs to another village.

508
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,010
Shouldn't you be staying in the dorm?

509
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,500
Why are you here?

510
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,180
Cheng Min Jun was afraid
that I might be bored.

511
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,010
So he brought me here
to the countryside to see...

512
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,130
the greenery,

513
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,450
[Oh no, I forgot to block him.]

514
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,290
the fresh air,

515
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,850
the pristine water...

516
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,240
and to pick some fruits.

517
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,650
You idiot.

518
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,970
If it wasn't for my injury,

519
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,160
I would've joined your training.

520
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,330
What are you waiting for?

521
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,640
Carry on.

522
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,280
I'll be watching every moment of it.

523
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,730
Hang in there, guys.

524
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,770
Shen Wei Lian!

525
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,610
Faster, faster.

526
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,490
Here.

527
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,690
Faster, faster.

528
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,450
What should we do now?

529
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,910
Are we really turning
our outing into training?

530
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,010
I'm sorry.

531
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,330
It's all my fault.

532
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,080
I forgot to block his uncle.

533
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,570
What good is your apology?

534
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,230
Get us out this mess.

535
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,410
I'm so tired.

536
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,970
Look alive.

537
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,050
Why are you slowing down?

538
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,580
Faster, more efficient.

539
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,350
Brute! Weirdo!

540
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,530
Brute?

541
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,670
Where?

542
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,280
Did you call me a brute?

543
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,560
The driver is watching.

544
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,710
Apologize.

545
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,380
Why should I?

546
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,850
-I'm not apologizing.
-You...

547
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,930
I'm not in a hurry anyway.

548
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,650
If you don't apologize,

549
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,450
I won't let you leave.

550
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,210
I'm taking a new order.

551
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,580
Are you guys getting off?
Otherwise I'm charging.

552
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,030
-Sure.
-Sure.

553
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,830
You owe me an apology.

554
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,470
Why should I apologize?

555
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,450
You're one crazy woman.

556
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,760
You... Come back.

557
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,770
Don't you walk off without an apology.

558
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,010
Why should I apologize?

559
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,410
Are you out of your mind?

560
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,770
Apologize now.

561
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,200
Why do you have that?

562
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,970
Why not?

563
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,050
Can't I use this?

564
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,490
You're such a pervert!

565
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,380
-You're insane.
-Pervert?

566
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,300
Guilty as charged.

567
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,690
That girl dropped her purse.

568
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,580
Pass it to her.

569
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,690
Let's keep going.

570
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,540
This isn't right.

571
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:14,730
We...

572
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,170
Why should we listen to him?

573
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,680
He's not Coach Ma.

574
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,210
Because we lied to him.

575
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,370
We're just afraid to upset him.

576
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,170
But now, we might as well come clean.

577
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,490
I don't know about you guys,
but I can't go on.

578
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,730
-You're quitting?
-Yep.

579
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,770
You heard me right.

580
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,970
Who should tell him, then?

581
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,950
As usual, let's decide by voting.

582
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,430
Wait a second.

583
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,160
You guys had better not nominate me again.

584
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,650
Of course not.

585
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,870
Those who think he shouldn't go,
raise yor hand.

586
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,890
-Go...
-Why is it me again?

587
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,370
-Go.
-Go.

588
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,290
Just go.

589
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,490
Sang Tian,

590
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,810
just go.

591
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,250
Go.

592
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,340
What are you waiting for?

593
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,170
[You guys are obviously...]

594
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,170
[sending me to my doom.]

595
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,050
[For a matter like this,]

596
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,730
[the more I explain,
the angrier he'll get.]

597
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,120
[Sister, I'm at the homestay's
main entrance.]

598
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,090
[Where are you?]

599
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,730
Traitor! He ran away.

600
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,890
-Wei Lian, you go.
-Wait.

601
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,650
Why me?

602
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,810
Isn't Wen Bing your best friend?

603
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,330
We don't have any husky
dog figurine, right?

604
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,410
-Right.
-Go!

605
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,430
-Come on.
-Just go.

606
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,980
Your mission.

607
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,800
Did anyone find out?

608
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,970
I was delayed by a crazy woman.

609
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,050
Crazy woman?

610
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,470
It doesn't matter. Is that all?

611
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,530
I'll leave you, then.

612
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,050
Okay, okay.

613
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,500
That's my boy.

614
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,000
Now scram.

615
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,530
Shouldn't you be training
instead of coming here?

616
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,890
Listen to yourself.

617
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,190
I was worried you might be bored.

618
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,260
I'm here to tell you a story.

619
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,790
Sure, go ahead.

620
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,970
Long time ago,

621
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,800
a friend of mine...

622
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,530
had a teammate who accidentally
broke his arm.

623
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,490
His injury was different from yours.

624
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,370
He had a fracture, not a dislocation.
It was terrible.

625
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,090
Later on,

626
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,430
the doctor told us...

627
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,150
not to bring him along when we go out
to have fun.

628
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,530
Otherwise, his condition might worsen.

629
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,010
What happened next?

630
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,560
Don't you guys think
Wen Bing looks unusual?

631
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,770
A little bit. What do you think, Li He?

632
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,620
I think he's plotting something.

633
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:56,780
If...

634
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,650
I'm just saying if...

635
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,540
you were that teammate,

636
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,770
how would you deal with my friend?

637
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,210
I would blacklist him.

638
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,820
Blacklist?

639
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,409
I think he went too far, too.

640
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,969
He deserves to be blacklisted.

641
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,010
Right?

642
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,650
Look at his eyes.

643
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,360
Aren't they menacing?

644
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,210
Is there anything else?

645
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,530
No.

646
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,949
Enjoy your food, I'll get back
to training.

647
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,710
He's coming back.

648
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,929
-How did it go?
-How did it go?

649
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,560
Just keep training.

650
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,489
Let's go.

651
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,230
They sent me to confront
Wen Bing just now.

652
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,270
Did I blow our cover when I walked away
like that?

653
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,400
Why is he still there?

654
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,670
Because you ran away just now.

655
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,250
I didn't run away.

656
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,080
I had a stomach ache.

657
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,410
Sang Tian, are you okay?

658
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,450
Are you still in pain?

659
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,250
I am.

660
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,610
Sang Tian, please.

661
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,650
Go talk to Wen Bing.

662
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,850
We can't train any more.

663
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,050
-Come on.
-I...

664
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,090
Please, Sang Tian.

665
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,570
-Wen Bing only listens to you.
-Yes.

666
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,410
-Just talk him out of this.
-I don't know what to tell him.

667
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,330
Just...

668
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,140
He's here.

669
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,810
I hear there's a pick-your-own garden
nearby.

670
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,380
Care to join me?

671
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,890
Of course...

672
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,980
Of course...

673
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,410
But wouldn't it affect your training?

674
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,330
No.

675
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,050
-No...
-No...

Good.

677
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,170
Deputy Monitor, you make the call.

678
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,000
We should balance training with resting.

679
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,530
Why don't we follow
our squad leader's suggestion...

680
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,070
and visit the garden with him?

681
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,560
Squad Leader, we've decided to go.

682
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,530
What about me?

683
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:11,930
You?

684

-Look.

691
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,730
There's banana, grape,

692
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,330
pomegranate, persimmon, plum, pear.

693

I love potatoes.

695
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,370
Do you know that a pig weighing 48 kg...

696
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,210
needs to consume 4 kg of potatoes...

697
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,650
and 0.9 kg of pig feed daily...

698
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,290
in order to fatten up?

699
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,650
Why should I know what pig eats daily?

700
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,690

-Do you weigh 48 kg, perchance?

You...

It takes one to know one, I guess.

705
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,450
Should I give you this
little flower as a reward?

00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,050
A pig with a flower.

707
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,410
You're a pig.

What are you two doing
chatting over there?

709
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,850
-Yes.
-Let's play a little game.

710
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,210
Let's divide into teams of two
by spinning the bottle.

711

Whichever team picks the most fruit wins.

-Sure, I'll spin it.
-Sure.

713

Go, go... Okay, my turn.

You have a partner.

Then I'll team up with Li He.

724

You're both alone.

725

who broke his arm by accident?

737
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,380
Well, there's no strength left in his arm.

738
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,410
You guys carry on.

739

We'll be on our way.

-Wei Lian, what was that about?
