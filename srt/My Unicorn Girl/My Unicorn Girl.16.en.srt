[the demoness with the red scarf.]

[Why don't I give her a scarf?]

190

[She has so many scarves.]

191
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,070
[There's no point giving her more.]

192

[What should I make?]

194
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,190
[How about cross-stitching?]

195

[Tell her it's from your crush.]

196

[You can embroider a "happy birthday,
mother" or something.]

214

-Who are you?
-Wen Bing's friend.

215
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,950
May I have a few minutes?

216
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,070
This is a birthday gift
from Wen Bing.

217
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,950
He asked me to give it to you.

218
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,750
He's been so busy with training...

219
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,390
but he wanted to give you a surprise.

220
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,590
Did he just learn it?

221
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,430
Yeah, it took a good few attempts.

222
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,030
This is the best out of the lot.

223
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,310
-Is that right?
-Mrs. Cheng,

224
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,230
you... don't like it?

225
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,790
What I like is honesty.

226
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,589
I...

227
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,190
Mrs. Cheng, I'm sorry.

228
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,829
I made this.

229
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,349
I know you two are having a tiff.

230
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,310
So I took matter into my own hands...

231
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,670
and tried to patch things up.

232
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,069
You deliberately try to approach me...

233
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,069
because of your father?

234
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,190
Mrs. Cheng, what are you saying?

235
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,310
The stock price of Meng Steel
crashed recently.

236
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,470
To get himself out of a bind,

237
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,710
Meng Ru Hai is using his daughter as bait.

238
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,310
Looks like your father
really is desperate.

239
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,990
Mrs. Cheng, my father would never do
such a thing.

240
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,670
My family is not as pitiful as you think.

241
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,830
Besides, I...

242
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,350
I really like Wen Bing.

243
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,510
But Wen Bing will never like you.

244
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,550
Stop wasting your effort.

245
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,230
Mrs. Cheng...

246
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,510
Enough.

247
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,790
How could she think I was being deceitful?

248
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,510
I had nothing but good intentions.

249
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,750
Why is she here by herself?

250
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,190
It's too dangerous.

No...

An enemy of my sister
is an enemy of mine.

253
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,670
I must be as cold as winter
towards the enemy.

254
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,230
Why?

255

Stop right there.

257
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,310
How did you recognize me?

258
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,710
I can recognize you
even if you turn into ashes.

259
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,310
Sit here.

260

Come!

261
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,070
Why being in love is so hard?

262
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,670
So Wen Bing's mother told you off.

Must you cry me a river?

264

Can you be any more fragile?

Listen here!

266
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,910
From now on, I no longer like him.

267

I'm moving on.

268
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,310

269
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,190
What... the hell are you talking about?

270
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,710
Why do you look so familiar?

271
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,230

-What did I...

276
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,870
You ruined my skirt.

277
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,510
You're drunk. I helped you the other day.

278
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,110

-Why would I lie?

333
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,910
See last night's game records
for yourself.

334
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,550
Ten at night till five in the morning?

335
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,990
-What did I say?
-We played the night away?

336
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,430
It was with Kidney Hurt, not you.

337
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,150
I am Kidney Hurt.

338

-You're Kidney Hurt?
-Surprised?

-Shocked?
-You...

340

This is fate.

You said you're the best support.

-You tricked me!
-No, listen first.

343

It's purely an accident. An accident...

344

Stop right there.

345

I'm warning you. Last night's incident...

346

I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.

-Get out, now. Not another word.
-Give me a minute.

353

I know you're Wen Bing's classmate
but our chairman won't see you.

until midnight.

He's been standing in the cold wind
for three hours.

Mr. Sang is so persistent.

Does it have to do with Wen Bing?

365
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,630
Did he say what he brought?

366
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,470
I did not inquire.

367
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,470
He said he must see you today.

368
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,190
Otherwise, he won't leave.

369
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,430
He's quite stubborn.

and send it to me.

This is the ticket to tomorrow's match.

I hope you can come
and watch Wen Bing play.

380
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,310
Mrs. Cheng,

381
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,350
this is Wen Bing's first time playing
for our school.

382
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,830
It's very important to him.

383
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,150
He's been practicing very late.

384
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,310
If you could come and watch him play,
he'll be very happy.

I don't have time.

Mrs. Cheng, you know something?

387
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,470
Ninety percent of people in this world...

388
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,270
never knew what their life's passion is.

389
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,910
Just like me.

390
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,310
So?

391
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,710
So, I envy Wen Bing.

392
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,710
Because he'd always loved ice hockey
since he was little.

393
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:30,030
If he's fortunate enough
to have the support of his family,

394
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,750
he'll be the happiest person in the world.

395
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,590
I don't have that chance...

396
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,190
but I hope that...

397
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,830
he can be one of the lucky ones.

What if you approach my mother again?

407

I might as well save her the trouble
of tearing it.

she may not approve of you
playing ice hockey,

496
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,630
Think about it. Living in a room...

497
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,989
with a person who wants to kiss you
everyday.

498
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,870
What if you fall asleep one day, and he...

499
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,989
But I'm a guy.

500
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,909
Tian Tian, just imagine.

501
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,590
If you've been blind for years...

502
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,670
and suddenly you're able to see,

503
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,430
would you care if it's a guy or a girl?

504
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,670
Hell, you'd kiss a gorilla.

505
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,750
Are you crazy?
Gorilla?

506
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,750
There's a big difference here.

507
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,270
I'm a human.

508
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,790
If he gets fresh with me,
I won't spare him.

509
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,110
Don't worry.

510
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,630
I'll find a way to cure
his face blindness.

511
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,070
[Don't lean, don't climb]

512
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,070
Hello, Coach.

513
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,710
Chen Chen, Ma Ma, Chen Chen Ma.

514
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,910
-Ma Ma Chen.
-Enough!

515
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,630
This is a school. Can you not call me
pet names?

516
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,790
Alright. Tell me, then.

517
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,830
What do you like to hear?
I'll call you that.

518
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,750
Let's cut to the chase.

519
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,150
Here. I guarantee it's an actual gift,
not a freebie.

520
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,670
You can ask the store.

521
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,150
I'm older than Xue Fei.
I don't need it.

522
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,990
Chen Chen, please.
It was a misunderstanding.

523
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,150
Coach Xue was dumped.
I just wanted to help her.

524
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,470
But then you saw it.
It's a misunderstanding!

525
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,590
Misunderstanding?
I've nothing to do with you.

526
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,310
I don't really care.
You can help whoever you want.

527
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,910
Chen Chen, please.

528
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,750
Add me back in your WeChat.
Let's talk it over.

529
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,750
Get up!

530
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,270
I won't get up.

531
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,310
I won't get up as long as you're mad
at me.

532
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,190
Fine.

533
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,390
If you stand up, then you're a jerk!

534
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,190
I won't leave.

535
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,790
-Hello, Coach Ma.
-Coach Ma.

536
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,990
Come to my office later.

537
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,590
Bring trainers... Bring jerseys!

538
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,790
Take the shoe.

539
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,270
Take it.

540
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,630
Chen Chen...

541
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,190
Why do you treat me like this?

542
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,030
-Are these clothes for the freshman?
-Yes.

543
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,710
Why didn't you ask them to take it?

544
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,310
Distribute it later.

545
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,270
-Don't worry, Captain.
-You can't see me...

546
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,390
You can't see me...

547
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,810
Have I ever failed you?

548
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,150
Meng Na.

549
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,750
What are you doing?

550
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,070
You can recognize me in this state?

551
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,870
Of course, you're my sister.

552
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,870
Your hair...

553
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,350
Your clothes...

554
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,310
What happened to you?

555
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,190
What's with the glasses?
Didn't you say they're dorky?

556
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,750
Did I say that?

557
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,310
No, I think glasses are fashionable.

558
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,550
Have you been drinking?

559
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,110
No wonder you didn't answer
my calls yesterday.

560
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,630
Tell me. Who did you drink with,
where did you drink,

561
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,470
when did you go home, and how?

562
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,270
-I drank a little at Lisa's birthday.
-What?

563
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,670
I drank a little at Lisa's birthday.

564
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,910
Lisa's birthday? It couldn't be.

565
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,310
Why didn't she post it online?

566
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,670
Does she have to report everything to you?

567
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,070
-It's her birthday...
-Shut up!

568
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,030
Never mind.

569
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,390
Meng Na, your eyes are red.

570
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,910
-Were you crying?
-No!

571
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,710
Yes.

572
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,190
It's normal to shed a tear or two
at my bestie's birthday.

573
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,990
Come...

574
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:23,150
Tell me honestly. I won't get mad.

575
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,110
Did Wen Bing break your heart again?

576
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,910
I knew it's that jerk!

577
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,630
Let's go teach him a lesson!

578
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,830
No way. What's your problem?

579
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,550
I've embarrassed myself enough
in front of his mother.

580
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,590
I...

581
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,470
Okay, fine.

582
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,750
If you won't go, I'll take care
of him myself.

583
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,070
When I'm through, that jerk will be
grovelling before you.

584
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,030
Not so fast!

585
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,590
-Who did you call a jerk?
-Wen Bing.

586
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,430
He caused you so much anguish.
Of course he's a jerk.

587
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,310
Listen here, who said you can call him
a jerk?

588
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,710
Only I can call him a jerk.

589
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,150
-Alright...
-Do you hear me?

590
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,550
Alright, I won't call him a jerk.

591
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,550
But he still needs to apologize.

592
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,950
-Stop right there!
-Don't...

593
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,490
-Come back...
-He must apologize!

594
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,070
-My clothes!
-The jerseys...

595
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,510
Coach Ma prepared these jerseys
for the freshmen.

596
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,070
-It's for tomorrow's match.
-Tomorrow?

597
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,990
Brother Wen Bing won't have anything
to wear, then.

598
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,190
-That's right.
-I don't care.

599
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,670
You'd better fix it.

600
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,470
Otherwise, don't even talk to me.

601
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,230
Na Na... Na Na!

602
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,590
[Why are their jerseys the same?]

603
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,910
[How are we to play?]

604
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,470
[How are we to play?]
