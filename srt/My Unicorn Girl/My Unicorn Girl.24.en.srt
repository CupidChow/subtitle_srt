00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,060
Let's work harder and not let
them score any more goals.

167
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,980
-Okay.
-Come on.

168
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,140
-Let's do our best.
-Go!

169
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,150
Your performance will end now.

170
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,540
The referee has dropped the puck.

171
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,140
Shen Qiao Di snatched the puck and...

172
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,420
did an under knee pass to
his teammates behind him.

173
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,300
Qianbei Team reacted immediately
with a formation to attack.

174
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,580
Shen Qiao Di is controlling the puck now.

175
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,460
He has cracked the defense.

176
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,740
Huang Hao Ran tried to intercept
a few times but did not succeed.

177
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,700
Wen Bing suddenly appears from the side.

178
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,820
He lifted Shen Qiao Di's hockey stick
and intercepted the puck successfully.

179
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,260
Qianbei's team leader is coming
to snatch the puck.

180
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Will Wen Bing continue to
attack like before?

181
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,100
Or, will he cooperate with his teammates?

182
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,420
Pass the puck.

183
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,900
-Meng Qi is signalling to Wen Bing.
-Pass the puck.

184
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,620
We can see that Meng Qi seems desperate.

185
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,740
However, Wen Bing seems to want
to crack the defense by himself.

186
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,500
Will he make the same mistake again?

187
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,900
Pass the puck.

188
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh no, Shen Qiao Di increased
his speed and caught up.

189
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,220
He snatched the puck away.

190
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,980
[Team Qianbei is in control now.]

191
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,430
Shen Qiao Di has reached the goal.

192
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,180
He did a false action and...

193
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,540
moved the puck behind in between his legs.

194
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,700
He faked his move and
tricked the goalkeeper.

195
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,900
He shot straight in.

196
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,900
Qianbei scores a point and
both teams are now tied.

197
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,830
Don't worry. There's still a chance.

198
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,170
Wen Bing, what were you doing?

199
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,540
The team leader had
a gap to catch the puck.

200
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,220
Why did you attack by yourself?

201
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,380
Something wrong with your eyes?
Are you blind?

202
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,220
Why didn't you mention how
Wen Bing scored the first goal for us?

203
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,900
There are two rearguards on your left.

204
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,820
[Did you not see them?
Or are you blind?]

205
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
-[Who are you talking about?]
-I'm talking about you!

206
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,860
You should score then if you're so good.

207
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,460
Then you should have defended the goal.

208
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,660
What did you think I was doing?

209
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
Enough, both of you!

210
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,880
We shouldn't be fighting
among ourselves now.

211
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,540
Sang Tian, did you see that?

212
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,020
[We are in disarray because
you're not around.]

213
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,420
[Let's outflank them more
in the second period.]

214
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,020
-[Let's cooperate in small teams.]
-[Okay.]

215
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,350
You can still try harder
in the next period.

216
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,410
This is not the time to
fight amongst yourselves.

217
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,780
Yes, that's right.

218
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,780
You agree too?

219
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,380
You...

220
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,340
It's starting. Quick.

221
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,140
The game has restarted.

222
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,100
Qianbei got the puck again at the faceoff.

223
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,660
A great pass.

224
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,400
Shen Qiao Di has the puck.

225
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,660
We can see that Liuye's Shen Wei Lian
has charged forward.

226
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,820
He is moving directly towards
Shen Qiao Di.

227
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,620
Is he going to check Shen Qiao Di?

228
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,900
However, he got hit by
Shen Qiao Di and fell.

229
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,620
Shen Qiao Di is very good at bodychecking.

230
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,140
I didn't understand Shen Wei Lian's move.

231
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,620
Shen Qiao Di is in front of the goal post.

232
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,660
He takes aim.

233
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,970
It's a goal! Qianbei takes the lead!

234
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,470
Yan Wu Xu.

235
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,140
There seems to be an accident

236
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,380
Liuye's goalkeeper seems to be injured.

237
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,540
How are you?

238
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,500
Slowly.

239
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,930
Xiao Xiao.

240
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
You're up!

241
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,580
Me?

242
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,100
Well, Sang Tian, I can't talk anymore.

243
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,260
[I'm switched in.]

244
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,500
Okay. All the best, Xiao Xiao.

245
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,140
Xiao Xiao, do your best.

246
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,860
Perhaps the injury was serious.

247
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,260
Liuye has replaced the goalkeeper.

248
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,180
It seems more difficult for them
to reverse the situation now.

249
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,260
Do your best.

250
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,750
No sweat. I believe you can do it.

251
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,820

-Good luck.
-Good luck.

The game has resumed.

254
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,900
Team Qianbei has possession.

255
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,060
Nice passes.

256
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,440
The player swiftly arrived
the front of the goal.

257
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,200
An easy goal!

[Liuye 1, Qianbei 3]

They are last year's champions indeed.

The score is  now one is to three.

261

The gap has widened.

262
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,860
It seems like Liuye's newly replaced
goalkeeper, Xiao Xiao...

263
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,460
is not yet in the zone.

[Only 30 seconds remaining.]

Will Liuye be able to
make use of this half a minute?

267
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,460
Can Qianbei keep their defense?

268
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,620
Let's continue watching.

269
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,540
We can see that both teams are getting
more aggressive.

passes the puck to
the centreman, Meng Qi.

[Liuye 1, Qianbei 3]

passing through two Qianbei players.

Coach Ma, are you secretly engaged?

489
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,100
I never thought Coach Ma would...

490
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,500
Senior.

491
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,490
Coach Ma.

492
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,430
Could it be...

493
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,860
Senior, when are you getting married?

494
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,580
What's going on?

495
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,220
This is too small. Where's the diamond?

496
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,780
-This is happening too fast.
-Hey...

497
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,460
This is very expensive, okay?

498
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,260
I must warn you.
You have to treat Senior well.

499
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,580
It's not easy to court her.

500
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,980
You don't have to leave Liuye.

501
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,100
Of course.

502
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,790
Then, about the farewell just now...

503
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,460
I never thought of saying goodbye to you.

504
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,140
-This is so sweet!
-Look at them.

505
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,820
Stop being lovey-dovey in front of us.

506
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,440
I'll make a move first.

507
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,720
You're leaving?

508
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,900
-Quick, why are you standing there?
-Go after her, quick!

509
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,180
Go! Go after her!

510
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,190
-Sang Tian!
-All the best!

511
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,940
Do you think this is okay?

512
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,990
Yes.

513
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,200
This one.

514
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,630
I'm sure I aimed properly.

515
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,490
Aren't you a cyber genius?

516
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,430
Yet, you lost to a claw machine offline?

517
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,420
Sang Zhan. How dare you laugh at me.

518
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
You...

519
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,460
You are a dead man.

520
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,180
-Ouch!
-Get over here.

521
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,780
I'll break up with you if you can't
catch this toy today.

522
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,940
Is it so serious?

523
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,220
-Which one do you want?
-The pink one.

524
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,380
Watch me carefully.

525
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,740
Yes. Go down.

526
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,500
You caught it!

527
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,460
-Hurray!
-Who do you think I am?

528
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,860
I'm a genius in both
the cyber and offline world.

529
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,330
We will win and become the champion.

530
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,550
Why does this taste bland?

531
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,430
I reduced the sugar to one-third.
It's healthier.

532
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,860
You're a sportsman.

533
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,300
You should control your diet.

534
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,100
From now on, our shop will not sell
anything with high sugar content to you.

535
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,140
What? Give it to me if
you don't want to drink it.

536
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,810
I'll drink it.

537
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,140
Slow down.

538
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,850
One more, please.

539
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,860
[TiAmo]

540
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,300
Why did you hang up my call?

541
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,180
The time right now is our private time.

542
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,940
You cannot use your phone.

543
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,710
Then, what do you want to do?

544
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,650
There are many things we can do.

545
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,420
A hundred ways to conquer me.

546
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,460
Which one do you want to try now?

547
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,460
I...

548
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,820
Give it back to me.

549
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,240
-Come get it.
-You...

550
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,580
Wen Bing...

551
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,820
Wen Bing...

552
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,830
Wen Bing.

553
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,430
How are you feeling?

554
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,550
Sang Tian.

555
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,460
I can't see things clearly again.

556
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,340
I can't see things clearly, Sang Tian.

557
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
Quick.

558
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,300
Give me medicine.

559
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,060
You've got no cure.

560
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,520
You're getting smarter.

561
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,900
I can't trick you anymore.

562
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,610
Of course.

563
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,000
Do you still remember
what I asked you before?

564
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,700
Did you like me because I was
the only one whom you could see clearly?

565
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,670
What do you think?

566
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,770
You can see the world clearly now.

567
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,750
I...

568
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,120
Am I not your only one anymore?

569
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,130
Yes, you're not my only one.

570
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,920
You are the whole world to me.

571
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,510
I'm grateful to the snowball that hit you.

572
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,650
It brought you into my life.

573
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,510
It brought me my bestest friend,

574
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,380
and my lover.

575
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,700
I can tell you firmly that...

576
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,940
even though I can see
the world clearly now,

577
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,480
I still only have you in my eyes.

578
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,380
You should know by now...

579
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,350
why I gave you this unicorn.

580
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,990
It's because...

581
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,940
It's Liuye's university crest.

582
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,140
It represents honour and bravery.

583
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,810
It also represents...

584
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,630
unwavering love.

585
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,970
I love you.

586
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,670
Ti amo

587
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,620
[Bang!]

588
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,860
[Kabedon]

589
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,180
[You wouldn't dare forget all about me!]

590
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,180
[Since I've figured you out,
I'll get a new roommate.]

591
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,740
[I will find someone hundred times...
No, ten thousand times better than you!]

592
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,620
[Go look for one!]
[Of course I can.]

593
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,420
[Congratulations to end of production
for "My Unicorn Girl".]
