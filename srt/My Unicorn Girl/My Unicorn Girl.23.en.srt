The battery is out.

172
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,650
What now?

173
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,970
This scene reminds me of something.

174
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,040
Oh no, seriously?

175
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,120
The same plot
happened to both of my sister and me?

176
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,730
It's so unfortunate.

177
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,820
No way, I must tell my sister...

178
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,450
to kiss her boyfriend,

179
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,620
that gets rid of the bad luck.

180
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,770
Getting rid of bad luck?

181
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,470
What do you mean?

182
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,060
It's a long story.

183
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,320
I feel like time flies today.

184
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,640
We barely finished anything on the list.

185
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,880
What list?

186
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,140
"Sang Tian's Day As Woman Plan"

187
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,290
That is too much.

188
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,240
You knew I was a girl,

189
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,890
and you fooled me over and over again.

190
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,300
That's not entirely true.

191
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,800
Most of the time,
the credits outweighs the prank.

192
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,640
Such as the roadshow.

193
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,680
If I hadn't informed you in time,

194
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,330
you could have missed the 3v3 match...

195
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,440
and left Liuye Sports University.

196
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,170
I am mad at you now.

197
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,520
Hold this.

198
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,650
[Sister, Xiao Rou,]

-What's wrong?
-[Will you please come and save us?]

201
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,480
My brother is stranded at the theme park.

202
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,980
Theme park?

203

-What?
-My friend is stranded at the theme park.

204

I need to help them!

205
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,210
Get on.

206
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,440
This can't be right.

207
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,740
Just get on it. We must hurry.

208
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,090
Are you all right?

209
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,930
I am fine.

210
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,010
Hold tight.

211
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,880
Sit tight.

Hurry up.

214
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,930
Pull over, Wen Bing.

215
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,450
Sir, are you okay?

216
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,800
My sweet potatoes.

-Be careful.

-Have some rest.
-Slowly.

220
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,640
Sit down over here.

221
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,530
-Be careful.
-Watch it.

222
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,650
My sweet potatoes.

223
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,360
-We can pick them up.
-Leave it to us.

How could you sleep even in here?

240
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,270
The girl could have caught a cold here.

241
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,490
This suit is warm enough.

242

What?

Where is my sister? She is not here?

244

Doesn't she care that I am in danger?

Hello? Sang Tian?

What? Wen Bing is in the hospital?

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,330
Okay, I'll be right there.

248

Let's go.

Tian Tian, I am so sorry.

250

If I hadn't thrown tantrum,

251
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,330
and got locked inside the theme park,

252
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,760
none of this would have happened.

253
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,210
It's not your fault.

254
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,980
He was hurt...

255
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,010
because of me.

256
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,220
Sang Tian, don't worry.

257
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,180

260
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,480
Wen Bing had a minor concussion.

261
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,080
He just needs some rest.

262

Don't worry about it.

263

264
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,330
We can look after him for you.

265

You all should go home.

266

I'll keep him company.

267

But you stayed up all night.

268

Don't worry about me.

269
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,860
All right, we should go.

-Let's go.
-Tian Tian.

271

-We should get going.
-Take care.

272
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,580
Don't worry.

273
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,080
See you, goodbye.

I have so much to tell you.

276
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,410
I want you to wake up now.

277
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,530
Did you hear me?

278
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,840
Wake up now.

279
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,210
Chairman, should we make her leave?

280
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,140
No.

281
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,300
You may go now.

282
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,410
Yes.

I am sorry.

Sang Tian.

288
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,050
I owe you an apology.

289
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,120
I was wrong about you.

290
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,210
Auntie please, don't say that.

291
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,370

298
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,170
You should go home.

299
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,610
Get online and get back
the points you gave out.

300
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,220
If you don't get them back,

301
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,410
we are over.

302
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,640
Okay.

303
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,380
I'll get them back.

304
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,220
Right, did you tell anyone...

305
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,360
Sang Tian is my sister?

306
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,810
I didn't even tell my best friend Li Sha.

307
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,770
How could you...

308
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,930
How could you not trust me?

309
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,090
I trust you.

310
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,890
I trust you.

311
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,819
But we can't let anyone know...

312
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,880
she is my sister.

313
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,089
She will be expelled for that.

314
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,000
Very well.

315
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,430
Good night.

316

don't forget to contact me.

320
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,280
Fine!

[Hospital]

324

You are finally awake.

Help me up.

Be careful.

So? Does it still hurt?

330
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,460
You  scared me.

331

That won't happen again.

I'll hold you to that.

Let me get you some water.

You are still the same.

You can see me now?

Of course, I am still the same.

344
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,690
Because I always believe...

345
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,860
that one day...

346
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,020
you will see my face again.

347
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,330
But if I look different
from what you remembered,

348
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,250
if I became an old woman,

349
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,050
you wouldn't recognize me.

350
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,730
So, I must stay young forever.

351
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,730
Mother, you are still the same.

352
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,070
You look the same...

353
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,220
from what I remembered.

354
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,810
Do you know I use
 two facial masks every day,

355
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,850
so I wouldn't age too much?

356
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,440
Mother.

357
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,250
Now that I can see you,

358
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,810
you don't need to wear a red scarf.

359
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,850
Leave it.

360
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,220
I was afraid...

361
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,670
even with the red scarf on,

362
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,650
you couldn't see me anyway.

363
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,720
I was just kidding.

364
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,890
Actually,

365
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,090
I am used to wearing it.

366
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,530
Every time I see the red scarf,

367
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,090
it reminds me of you.

368
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,380
My little boy...

369
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,100
is all grown up now.

370
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,090
He can find his own path forward.

371
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,100
Someday,

372
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,690
he will leave.

373
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,490
So I must wear this red scarf...

374
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,290
so I can feel like...

375
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,100
you are always with me.

376
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,600
Mother.

377
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,890
I won't leave.

378
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,100
You will always
be my number one.

379
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,610
Aren't you...

380
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,690
the fortune-teller lady from the bus stop?

381
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,450
Mother?

382
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,120
Grandma?

383
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,330
Bing Bing.

384
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,020
There is something...

385
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,840
that I haven't told you.

386
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,290
When you were in that accident years ago,

387
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,410
while you were unconscious,

388
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,480
do you still remember...

389
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,280
there was a girl who was there
to help you?

390
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,970
Do you remember anything?

391
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,570
[Wake up!]

392
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,970
[Wake up! Hey!]

393
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,200
[Don't be afraid.]

394
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,130
[My mother is getting the police here.]

395
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,820
[Don't worry, I'll be here for you.]

396
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,530
[Don't fall asleep! Wake up!]

397
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,370
[You can't fall asleep! Wake up!]

398
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,090
[Wake up! Don't sleep!]

399
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,110
She was that girl.

400
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,580
She was that little girl!

401
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,870
If you hadn't mentioned,

402
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,880
I almost forgot that ever happened.

403
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,450
Before he went into a coma,

404
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,930
you were the last person he saw.

405
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,640
After meeting you again,

406
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,490
he recognises only your face.

407
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,810
Don't you think this is destined,

408
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,280
that fate brought you together?

409
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,990
Grandma,

410
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,970
how did you know I was having bad luck?

411
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,960
How did you find me at the bus stop?

412
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,130
I've been searching for you.

413
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,570
I realised you are the person
I was looking for.

414
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,270
And since you are so lovable...

415
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,670
and so kind,

416
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,530
I am sure you two would
be a perfect couple.

417
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,010
So I...

418
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,370
I...

419
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,490
used a little trick.

420
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,570
Grandma,

421
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,600
that "Kiss for Fortune"...

422
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,370
A kiss for fortune?

423
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,250
A kiss for fortune?

424
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,370
Grandma!

425
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,370
I made that up.

426
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,890
If I hadn't told you that,

427
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,050
would you have become...

428
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,450
Bing Bing's classmate?

429
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,840
Mother.

430
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,720
That prank was a little too much.

431
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,930
We live in the age of free relationships.

432
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,810
Young people should decide
for their own relationship.

433
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,610
-You are right.
-We should just...

434
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,770
stay out of it.

435
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,930
-Yes.
-Isn't that right, Sang Tian?

436
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,810
Grandma, Aunty,

437
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,810
I'll get the paperwork
for Wen Bing's discharge.

438
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,270
-Sure.
-Carry on.

439
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,970
Okay.

440
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,060
Mother.

441
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,970
What made you change your mind
on Sang Tian so quickly?

442
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,290
No.

443
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,170
From the first moment I saw her,

444
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,810
I already started to like her.

445
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,640
Just like Grandma here.

446
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Really?

447
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,970
Really.

448
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,270
Good.

449
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,000
Mother?

450
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,880
Bing Bing.

451
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,210
You are an adult.

452
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,170
Your life is your decision.

453
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,430
Make choices on your own.

454
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,290
Your mother will give you
her full support.

455
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,080
Min Li.

456
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,450
Isn't that right?

457
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,340
Of course.

458
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,290
I want her as my future daughter-in-law.

459
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,860
Okay, that settles it.

460
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,450
Mother, it's been a while.

461
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,690
Let's have lunch together,
I need to have a long talk with you.

462
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,820
Sure.

463
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,810
Both of you are leaving now?

464
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,650
What about me?

465
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,450
Your future wife will take care of you.

466
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,950
Isn't that great?

467
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,770
-Goodbye, Grandma.
-Goodbye.

468
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,040
Goodbye.

469
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,640
[Liuye Sports University]

470
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,170
Hello? Principal?

471
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,290
-[What's the matter?]
-As it turned out...

472
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,480
[What Sang Tian did was unacceptable.]

473
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,350
It tarnished the reputation
of our university.

474
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,450
I am aware of that.

475
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,250
I should be responsible for
not finding out sooner.

476
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,360
If I am to be suspended,

477
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,940
I'll gladly accept the punishment.

478
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,900
But Sang Tian is an outstanding student.

479
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,120
If there is any other way to resolve this,

480
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,160
I really hope you can consider the option.

481
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,490
Sunglasses while indoors? He is funny.

482
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,770
Why is he wearing that?

483
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,080
He thinks he is famous.

484
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,420
He is wearing sunglasses.

485
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,720
Is this really necessary?

486
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,970
You are not a movie star.

487
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,210
What do you know?

488
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,410
I just regained my sight.

489
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,090
I must filter out the bright light.

490
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,010
From what I see,

491
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,620
you are wearing that...

492
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,920
so you could stare at other girls.

493
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,440
How do you even know that?

494
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,570
You...

495
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,080
I'll make you pay later.

496
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,890
-Hello?
-[Sang Tian, something serious happened.]

497
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,460
[Come to my office.]

498
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,080
As you can see,

499
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,940
we can no longer contain the secret.

500
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,210
[So the day has come.]

501
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,250
Coach Ma, give me some time.

502
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,650
I'll find whoever posted this.

503
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,790
I'll make them delete it.

504
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,100
No, it's too late for that.

505
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,410
There must be another way.

506
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,490
I can talk to the person who posted it.

507
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,690
-I can...
-Wen Bing.

508
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,120
This is my fault to begin with.

509
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,440
I lied to the university.

510
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,730
I lied to everyone.

511
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,170
So I must be held responsible.

512
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,680
Coach Ma.

513
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,040
Thank you for looking after me
all this time.

514
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,930
If your superiors ever ask,

515
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,830
tell them you didn't know anything.

516
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,730
You've done enough for me.

517
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,900
I don't want my mistake
to trouble you.

518
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,970
You are not troubling anyone.

519
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,440
This is Principle Hong's fault.

520
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,170
Had he listened to my advice...

521
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,600
and open the female ice hockey course,

522
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,700
none of this would have happened.

523
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,770
Coach Ma, can Sang Tian join us...

524
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,400
for the University Ice Hockey League
before she goes?

525
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,580
I am afraid that is not possible.

526
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,890
I do want you on the field,

527
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,910
but this scandal...

528
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,490
could affect the image of
Liuye Sports University.

529
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,480
Not to mention,

530
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,990
from now on,

531
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,010
you are no longer allowed
to take the ice hockey course.

532
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,880
You must leave the dormitory.

533
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,770
Leave the dormitory?

534
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,600
Coach Ma, she has nowhere to go.

535
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,690
Senior.

536
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Senior.

537
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Since Sang Tian...

538
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,360
is no longer playing ice hockey,

539
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,920
she is no longer your student.

540
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,090
What do you mean

541
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,200
I have an idea.

542
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,840
Transfer Sang Tian...

543
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,220
to the Figure Skating Department.

544
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,710
She can audit the class.

545
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,200
She can live in the dormitory
of Figure Skating Department.

546
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,090
Sang Tian was the best student...

547
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,690
in my department.

548
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,360
To be your audit student...

549
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,840
is below her standard.

550
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,370
No, not at all.

551
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,800
Really?

552
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,730
I'll leave her to you.

553
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,360
Welcome, Sang Tian.

554
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,910
Breaking news!

555
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,340
A girl disguised as a boy...

556
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
and joined the Ice Hockey Department.

557
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,780
That is unbelievable.

558
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,940
See for yourself.

559
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,270
Who could it be?

560
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,340
Who could it be?

561
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,620
-Wen Bing?
-No way.

562
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,950
Sang Tian?

563
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,940
It could be...

564
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,830
Sang Tian.

565
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,570
Mr Li here got the point.

566
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,490
Sang Tian...

567
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,900
must be the person.

568
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,650
Xiao, what are you talking about?

569
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,980
Deputy Monitor!

570
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,560
Shen Wei Lian is picking on me again.

571
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,830
Wei Lian.

572
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,400
Stop bullying Xiao Xiao.

573
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,310
Yes, you are always bullying me.

574
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,870
Deputy Monitor,

575
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,130
there is a scandal on the school forum.

576
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,030
Apparently, a girl disguised as a man...

577
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,370
and joined our department.

578
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,230
Xiao Xiao insisted it was you.

579
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,000
Come on and prove him wrong.

580
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,470
Of course, I didn't say that.

581
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,380
It was Li He.

582
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,110
I...

583
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,270
was just guessing.

584
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,590
Your guess is right.

585
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,990
I am a girl.

586
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,550
Sang Tian was kidding.

587
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,230
He is joking.

588
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,390
That was intense.

589
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,970
She is a girl.

590
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,510
I can prove it.

591
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,710
What?

592
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,840
You are crazy!

593
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,620
I get it now!

594
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,310
So that day at the barbecue shop...

595
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,710
Shen Wei Lian spilt on
Sang Tian's clothes.

596
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,660
Sang Tian wouldn't let him clean it.

597
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,390
So this is the reason.

598
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,870
Hold on.

599
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,590
When you helped me wash the car,

600
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,360
Sang Tian was drenched wet.

601
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,380
It was Shen Wei Lian...

602
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,240
who put the clothes on her.

603
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,990
You are right.

604
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,150
Wei Lian.

605
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,840
Did you know I was a girl a long time ago?

606
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,930
It wasn't too long ago.

607
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,600
It's after my brother and I
had that match.

608
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,110
That's when I found out.

609
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,320
It's so long ago.

610
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,510
Did you see anything you shouldn't have?

611
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,640
No, I saw nothing.

612
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,910
Shen Wei Lian, if you saw nothing,

613
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,470
how did you know Sang Tian was a girl?

614
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,600
Stop talking!

615
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,690
So you found out on that day!

616
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,550
-Nonsense!
-Make yourself clear!

617
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,150
I think he found out...

618
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,270
on that day!

619
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,990
-Stop talking or...
-All right.

620
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,350
Wei Lian kept that secret for me
for so long.

621
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,300
Thank you, Wei Lian.

622
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,580
Of course.

623
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,180
Unlike someone else,

624
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,270
I don't make trouble.

625
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,410
Who may that be?

626
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,950
All right.

627
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,270
Deputy Monitor,
you kept us in the dark for so long.

628
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,760
That is not right.

629
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,510
I am sorry.

630
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,770
I should have told you sooner.

631
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,160
But...

632
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,750
my name is really called Sang Tian.

633
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,560
It's "Tian" for "sweetness".

634
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,210
Actually,

635
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,110
it wasn't my first intention...

636
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,070
to join the Ice Hockey Department.

637
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,830
All of us...

638
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,100
have been classmates for months.

639
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,030
I knew it all along...

640
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,760
that my secret will be known someday.

641
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,870
But I never thought...

642
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,230
that day would arrive so soon.

643
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,510
I thought we could be in
the University Ice Hockey League...

644
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,389
before my secret is out.

645
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:25,790
So, you won't be joining us?

646
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,060
I am no longer...

647
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,300
part of the ice hockey team.

648
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,120
But I thank you for taking care of me
for all this time.

649
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,040
Sang Tian, are you going to
leave the university?

650
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,690
That is not fun at all.

651
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,870
I was just kidding.

652
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,100
I am now auditing
the figure skating class.

653
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,190
I am glad to hear that.

654
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,510
We use the same court as them.

655
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,130
We will have plenty of chances
to see each other again.

656
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,910
All the best in the league.

657
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,070
Don't let me down.

658
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,390
Keep fighting.

659
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,320
Keep fighting!

660
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,920
You...

661
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,170
why are you staring at me?

662
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,000
You are beautiful.

663
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,180
That took you long enough.

664
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,240
It's embarrassing when you stare at me.

665
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,990
What do you want?

666
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,510
Give me your hand.

667
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,790
I want to cherish...

668
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,430
my last moment with you as your roommate.

669
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,210
Dance with me.

670
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,200
Where is my painting?
Where are you hiding it?

671
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,750
That is my painting.

672
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,700
But you used me as a model.

673
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,830
If you want to hide it,

674
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,750
you should at least get my consent.

675
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,080
You can have it.

676
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,130
But at a price.

677
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,230
What do you want?

678
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,790
A proper goodbye.

679
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,560
I never thought...

680
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,210
you would be so into decorum.

681
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,350
So be it.

682
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Goodbye. Is this enough?

683
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,640
That was a brush-off.

684
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,370
What more do you want?

685
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,470
A goodbye kiss?

686
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,630
I never kissed you when you are a girl.

687
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,270
I knew you two were acting weird.

688
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,640
I miscalculated.

689
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,160
So Senior Miao Miao...

690
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,060
and the Milk Tea girl were just excuses.

691
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,710
You are the biggest winner of all.

692
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,510
Did I say you can stare at her?

693
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,060
She is no longer your monitor.

694
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,620
She is Mrs Monitor.

695
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,600
Li He, you learnt all
the bad stuff from Xiao Xiao.

696
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,950
That is not my fault.

697
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,960
Mr Li learnt on his own.

698
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,400
He can now get the points,

699
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,990
he even knows how to drive a car.

700
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,280
But the way he driving...

701
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,040
can be a little overwhelming.

702
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,390
It's almost time.

703
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,320
I need to see her off.

704
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,500
Hold on.

705
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,600
Right, let's go.

706
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,750
Sang Tian.

707
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,880
This is the same car Wen Bing
got for his birthday.

708
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,400
It's for you, now you two
can have a pair together.

709
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,580
Thank you.

710
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,220
Sang Tian.

711
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,880
Open it after you get
to the female dormitory.

712
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,840
These will make me fat.

713
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,290
-No way.
-I can hold it.

714
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,040
Sang Tian.

715
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,960
This is for you.

716
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,050
This...

717
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,360
Shen Wei Lian.

718
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,840
This is so disgusting.

719
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,480
Why are you giving her this?

720
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,940
-You won't understand it.
-Disgusting.

721
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,920
I'll keep this for you.

722
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,750
Sang Tian, thank you.

723
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,160
You gave me courage.

724
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,630
Keep that spirit on.

725
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Enough chit-chat.

726
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,450
Let's take a picture together.

727
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,800
-Let this be our memory.
-Come on.

728
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,400
Come on.
