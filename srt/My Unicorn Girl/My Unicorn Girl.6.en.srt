00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
[I heard that there's someone you like]

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,560
What are the two of you doing here
on the weekend?

6
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,850
It's not what you think.

7
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,570
All right. They are just messing with you.

8
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,130
We already know.

9
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,729
You're punished to clean the ice rink
for cheating in the exam, right?

10
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,130
Let me handle this next time.

11
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,289
I'll help to clean the ice rink.

12
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,420
-No need for that.
-Why not?

13
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,370
In order to get the exam paper for us,

14
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,180
you went for a date,
and it screwed up your grades.

15
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,880
We should do something in return.

16
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,790
That's right. Take it...

17
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,290
as giving us a chance
to return the favour.

18
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,370
If you hadn't gotten
the exam paper,

19
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,560
our average score wouldn't tie
with the Figure Skating Department.

20
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,840
Really?

21
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,730
Thank you for that.

22
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,850
So I've decided...

23
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,030
to treat everyone to a meal
to celebrate it.

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,130
What do you think?

25
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,770
That's a good idea.

26
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,410
-Wen Bing and I have things to do later.
-What is it?

27
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,690
Are you both
really given special treatment?

28
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,810
-No, it's because I'm...
-Let's not be a buzzkill.

29
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,290
Let's go together.

30
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,190
Monitor, come on.

31
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,690
Monitor, what would you like to eat?

32
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,050
-Barbecue?
-Hotpot?

33
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,450
-Japanese?
-Steak?

34
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,010
Anything you want.

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,090
It's fine with me.

36
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,210
Let's go.

37
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,450
I've done the cleaning today.

38
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,810
Whose turn is it tomorrow?

39
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,329
-Me!
-I'll do it too.

40
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,090
How about making a timetable?

41
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,370
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

42
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,290
-This is cooked. Wen Bing, here.
-All right.

43
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,010
It's cooked? I want this.

44
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,740
Here, Wen Bing.

45
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,330
Eat more.

46
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,280
-Here, Sang Tian.
-Thank you.

47
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,210
Shen Wei Lian, you're so unfair!

48
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,490
You're making it so obvious!

49
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,250
What's the matter?
Both of them have done a great job.

50
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,650
We need to give them special treatment.

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,690
Have you forgotten...

52
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,650
who was the one who informed you...

53
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,700
about the exercises
in Figure Skating Department?

54
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,910
Fine, you're our saviour too.

55
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,250
What's wrong? No appetite?

56
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,450
Didn't you promise to have hot pot together?

57
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,370
Li He.

58
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,640

59
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,890
Look.

60
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,620
-It's delicious! I want another one.
-Sure.

61
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,250
-Meaning?
-I'll help to get other dishes.

62
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,410
Roommates have a harmonious connection.

63
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,010
Look. They get along so well.

64
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,950
And?

65
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,890
Peel the shrimp for me.

66
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,990
No.

67
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,730
Would you like some shrimp?

68
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,150
Yes.

69
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,980
Would you like to eat this?

70
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,970
Why are you so childish?

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,529
That's so childish of you!

72
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,010
Who wants the shrimp you peeled?

73
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,529
Here come the dishes!

74
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,050
-Give me some.
-Give it to me.

75
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,910
-Sorry, I'll wipe it for you.
-It's fine. I can do it myself.

76
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,590
Why don't you remove the shirt?
I'll clean...

77
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,790
I said it's fine!

78
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,990
Sang Tian, why are you being so shy?

79
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,290
We're all guys. It's not like
you're not wearing anything inside.

80
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,290
-That's right.
-Yes, why bother?

81
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,530
You might as well just remove it
and get changed here.

82
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,650
-What are you still waiting for?
-Just get changed.

83
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,970
-Go and get changed.
-That's right.

84
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,050
Here, eat more.

85
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,530
You too.

86
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,290
thank god he helped me

87
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,460
Here's the beef for you.

88
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,410
Here.

89
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,200
Sang Tian.

90
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,370
-I'm sorry about earlier.
-It's fine.

91
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,850
I'll wash up when I get back later.

92
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,930
Eat up.

93
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,660
Where's Wen Bing?

94
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,500
He went out after receiving a call.

95
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,830
Is he seeing someone?

96
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,350
Knock it off. Mind your own business.

97
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,330
Here, Sang Tian.

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,570
Eat this.

99
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,650
I ate so much! I feel so bloated.

100
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,690
Let's call a cab.

101
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,770
I won't be joining you.

102
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,409
I want to buy something
from the supermarket.

103
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,490
We'll head back first then.

104
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,290
-Bye.
-See you at the dorm.

105
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,330
-Bye. We're leaving.
-Bye.

106
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,770
Bye.

107
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,330
Where did he go?

108
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,610
Here.

109
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,060
-Thank you, boss.
-You're welcome.

110
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,250
Boss, two oden, please.

111
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,050
Sorry, it's sold out.
Please come again tomorrow.

112
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,730
Brother Wen Bing?

113
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,290
It's you!

114
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,650
What a coincidence.

115
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,690
Are you here to buy oden too?

116
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,730
That's right. But I was too late.

117
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,770
Here, have mine.

118
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,130
It's fine. You can have it.

119
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,190
Sorry.

120
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,050
I couldn't help you with the exam.

121
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,150
I wanted to get you the exam paper.

122
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,100
But Li Sha was watching me all the time.

123
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,530
I couldn't get out of her sight.

124
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,610
How about this? The oden is on me.

125
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,970
Consider it my token of apology?
All right?

126
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,370
It's fine.

127
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,370
If you don't eat it,
it means you haven't forgiven me.

128
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,380
Is it good?

129
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,690
Here, take another one.

130
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,810
Take another one.

131
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,210
I mean it.

132
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,770
You can have it yourself.

133
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,280
I have to go back now.

134
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,210
Let's go back together then.

135
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,530
[I'm Wen Bing]

136
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,850
You jerk!

137
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,140
Didn't you promise to take me
to have oden together?

138
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,970
You went dating with another girl instead!

139
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,210
You're a pig head!

140
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,530
I'll beat you to death!

141
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,730
That's for being disobedient!

142
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,610
I'll beat you to death!

143
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,370
Shoot.

144
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm so skillful.

145
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,810
Congratulations!

146
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,690
The average score of your class
has finally caught up with ours.

147
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,810
If it weren't because Wen Bing
and Sang Tian's results were nullified,

148
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,430
your class would have been ranked first
in the school this time.

149
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,770
What are you implying?

150
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,810
I'm worried about you.

151
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,490
Look. After Wen Bing got into Liuye,

152
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,250
he became the main focus in the school.

153
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,090
He's very outstanding in all aspects.

154
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,450
But this exam brought down the score.

155
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,250
He was given a demerit, punishment,
and he has to resit the exam.

156
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,410
What if...

157
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,290
he couldn't bounce back
after a setback?

158
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,850
What do we do?

159
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,330
So I think...

160
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,530
we should get his parents
to come to school more often...

161
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,610
to discuss it.

162
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,080
You seem to be making everything
your business.

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Am I?

164
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,220
I'm just doing this...

165
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,770
for your own good.

166
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,530

Hello.

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,090
[Coach Xue: Hello!]

169
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Brother Wen Bing.

170
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,690
I'm going in.

171
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,010
I'll get going then.

172
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,330
Are you all right?

173
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I'm fine.

174
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,690
Thanks, Brother Wen Bing.

175
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,250
I'll get going then.

176
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,410
[The headline for today.]

177
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,490
Bye.

178
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,010
It's becoming more like you, Piggy Head.

179
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,890
Hurry! Come out!

180
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,890
Come out!

181
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,490
Hurry! Come out!

182
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,450
-What is it?
-Breaking news!

183
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,770
-What is it?
-I know Wen Bing's secret.

184
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,610
-It's some juicy gossip. Want to hear it?
-Yes.

185
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,460
-What is it?
-Do you want to hear it?

186
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,030
Monitor, your roommate is taken!

187
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,370
-Who's he with?
-Meng Na!

188
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,290
-Meng Na?
-That's right.

189
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,650
I thought that's what it was.
Didn't they get together long ago?

190
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,260
-That's right.
-You didn't know, right?

191
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,210
It was just a rumour back then.

192
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,220
It was nothing at first.

193
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,990
I saw it myself
in front of the school today!

194
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,210
Both of them were...

195
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,010
They have progressed to that.

196
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,770
-What is it?
-Can you be more clear?

197
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,450
In front of the school.

198
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,160
Monitor, you're Wen Bing's roommate.

199
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,030
You should have known
about them, right?

200
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,230
Is there any secret to share with us?

201
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,610
I didn't know.

202
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,660
Get back to your room.

203
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,330
Don't say you heard it from me.

204
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,570
-Bye.
-Bye.

205
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,270
What were you talking about?

206
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,970
Someone in our dorm
is taken off the market.

207
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,040
Who?

208
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,210
Could it be you?

209
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,490
You should be awarded an Oscar.

210
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,850
There's solid proof now.

211
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,210
Yet, you keep pretending.

212
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,370
What are you murmuring about?

213
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,330
I said you're a Romeo. All right?

214
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,770
Please compliment me
on some other undiscovered qualities.

215
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,330
Here's your shirt.

216
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,330
I lent you my shirt.

217
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,010
You didn't even thank me.

218
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,730
Thank you.

219
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,010
[What's wrong with her today?]

220
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,950
[Does she have to be so mad
for not having oden?]

221
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,230
[The world of foodies
is incomprehensible to most people.]

222
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,640
Sang Tian!

223
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,620
-Morning.
-Where's Wen Bing?

224
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,690
Wen Bing? I think he isn't around.

225
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,930
Why is he out so early today?

226
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,970
I'll find him in the class. Bye.

227
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,210
[Why did I fall again?]

228
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,690
[Why is it the same
background music again?]

229
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,210
[Why is he staring at me?]

230
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,610
Are you all right?

231
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,290
I'm fine.

232
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,250
That's great then.

233
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,340
How's your leg? I'll check it for you.

234
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,290
You scraped your leg.

235
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,940
This is what I used to wear
when I was wearing the ice skates.

236
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,510
You can stick in on your feet.

237
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,330
It can prevent chafing.

238
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,970
[Wait a minute.]

239
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,010
[Could he have fallen in love with me?]

240
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,690
Try it on. See if it feels better.

241
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,650
It doesn't hurt.

242
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,270
Sang Tian, you're Wen Bing's friend.

243
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,400
You're also my friend.

244
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,290
Meng Na.

245
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,600
I'll give you the rest of it.

246
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,420
-This is...
-I'm going to class. Bye.

247
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,930
Why would he have these?

248
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,290
Gather around!

249
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,610
Get yourselves ready.

250
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,370
There's an outdoor training tomorrow
at three o'clock.

251
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,610
Another outdoor training?

252
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,650
Why are you complaining?

253
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,170
Monitor.

254
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,090
Yes.

255
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,810
Get someone to help you
to conduct on-the-spot checking...

256
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,860
and put up the route markings
based on the training route.

257
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,880
All right.

258
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,880
Class dismissed.

259
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,410
Let's get changed.

260
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,850
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

261
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,890
Need help?

262
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,690
I'm a little busy. But if you beg me,
I might consider it.

263
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,450
No need for that.

264
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,730
Wei Lian, come with me.

265
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,550
Monitor, I would love to.

266
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,410
But I have a dentist appointment
this afternoon.

267
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,690
-Sorry.
-I'll ask someone else then.

268
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,890
-Bye.
-I'm leaving.

269
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,370
I'll get going then.

270
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,390
Xiao Xiao, come with me.

271
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,010
-I'm not going.
-Xiao Xiao, I'll give you face masks!

272
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,250
I asked my friend to buy two boxes
of the face masks that you mentioned.

273
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,130
If you come with me...

274
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,460
Sure. Put up route markings?

275
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,770
-I'll go with you.
-All right.

276
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,170
[I don't have the time to help her
with the route markings.]

277
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,250
Brother Wen Bing.

278
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,589
It's you, Meng Na.

279
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,670
I want to tell you something

280
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,130
Sorry, I have training later.

281
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,710
Let's talk again next time.

282
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,210
It's about Sang Tian.

283
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,960
What about him?

284
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,280
I discovered his secret.

285
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,810
You haven't eaten, right?

286
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,570
Let's talk over dinner.

287
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,290
Wen Bing!

288
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,210
Give me a Sprite, please.

289
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
Wen Bing.

290
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,950
This is considered our first time
dating alone, right?

291
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,250
When did you learn Sang Tian's secret?

292
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,750
This morning,

293
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,780
he noticed the backs of my heels chafed.

294
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,690
He actually had this with him!

295
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,810
Any normal guys wouldn't carry this
with them all the time.

296
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,600
Am I right, Wen Bing?

297
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,720
[Shoot. If this gets out...]

298
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,810
[she'll be kicked out of Liuye.]

299
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,490
You didn't tell anyone about this, right?

300
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,800
No, you're the only one I told.

301
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,610
What do you plan to do?

302
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,490
I think this will hurt his reputation.

303
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,250
It's better to keep a lid on it.

304
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,070
You did the right thing.

305
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,250
But I have to get things straight
with him.

306
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,610
After all, I have someone
that I like already.

307
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,250
So you think his secret is...

308
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,310
He likes me!

309
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,900
Wen Bing, stay calm.

310
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,860
I swear. I don't like him.

311
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,750
Wait a minute.

312
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,850
I think...

313
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,540
you have misunderstood him.

314
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,900
Impossible.

315
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,690
He carries this around with him
because of me.

316
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,370
I think he must have been secretly
in love with me for some time.

317
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,370
Honestly...

318
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,810
Sang Tian...

319
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,930
has a lot of weird quirks.

320
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,610
What are they?

321
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,090
As his buddy,

322
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,960
I shouldn't talk bad behind his back.

323
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,000
But since you've brought this up,

324
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,680
I should be honest with you...

325
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,530
so that you wouldn't be fooled
by his look.

326
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,470
What is it? It sounds so serious.

327
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,170
He snores when he sleeps.

328
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,430
Also, he sleepwalks!

329
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,570
He always scared the crap out of me
in the middle of the night.

330
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,610
Also, he might look decent.

331
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,790
But he's so dirty when he's in the dorm.

332
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,600
He doesn't take shower if he stays in.

333
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,380
He wears his socks repeatedly...

334
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,530
and doesn't wash them for over a month.
It stinks so badly!

335
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,970
For real?

336
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,130
I didn't take him for someone like that.

337
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,650
The point is...

338
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,510
he's a real playboy.

339
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,330
Back in our dorm, I saw him...

340
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,730
texting several girls at a time...

341
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,500
and it was all cheesy lines!

342
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,830
For real?

343
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,010
Why would I lie to you?

344
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,550
In short, don't fall for him...

345
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,610
and don't mess with him.

346
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,770
That's impossible.

347
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,210
He always gives me a sincere look.

348
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,450
Observe him if you don't believe me.

349
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,270
In short, don't believe him.

350
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,050
[He purposely told me
so many bad things about Sang Tian.]

351
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,550
[He must be jealous because of me.]

352
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,610
Hello? What is it?

353
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,650
All right. I'll be right there. Bye.

354
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,090
What's the matter?

355
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,890
Something urgent came up. Take your time.

356
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,620
Wen Bing!

357
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,150
[See you later.]

358
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,850
[What?]

359
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,960
[Sang Tian: What?]

360
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,130
Tian Tian!

361
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,210
Tian Tian, you're screwed!

362
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,090
Do you still remember the rules
for falling in love I told you about?

363
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,230
Reply to someone's message
within ten seconds.

364
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,610
You just did it
in less than three seconds.

365
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,650
I didn't.

366
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,010
I didn't.

367
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,760
You've fallen in love with Wen Bing.

368
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,450
Impossible.

369
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,850
Well, did you secretly look at him
when he wasn't noticing?

370
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,770
No.

371
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,370
Did you look for him everywhere
when he wasn't around?

372
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,930
[Bye.]
[Bye.]

373
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,250
[Bye.]

374
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,730
[Where did he go?]

375
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,370
No.

376
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,770
So you weren't jealous when
he and Meng Na were being lovey-dovey?

377
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,650
I wasn't jealous!

378
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,330
Why would I be?

379
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,980
Tian Tian, ask yourself this.

380
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,130
Does it not hurt?

381
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,990
-No!
-Since you were little,

382
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,910
you'll keep blinking
whenever you tell lies.

383
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,100
I asked you three questions,
and you blinked each time.

384
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
It hurts!

385
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,890
Why did you pinch me?

386
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,970
A lie detector test.

387
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,730
I...

388
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,610
I have no idea what you're talking about.

389
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,370
I need to check the venue
for training later. I've to go!

390
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,180
Tian Tian, you're feeling guilty.

391
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,330
You took off so quickly!

392
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,730
Why are you here?

393
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,220
-Xiao Xiao was admitted to the hospital.
-What?

394
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,070
He got food poisoning from the hotpot.

395
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,350
That's really bizarre.

396
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,640
Is it because of carbon monoxide?

397
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,290
What's the matter?

398
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,690
You had an experience of food poisoning
because of eating a hotpot?

399
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,410
It's none of your business.

400
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,770
Watch your attitude.

401
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,080
I'm the only one who can help you now.

402
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,330
It's a long route.

403
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,180
You'll have to do it until late at night
to put up all these flags on your own.

404
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,810
Brother Wen Bing!

405
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,470
-Wen Bing.
-Why are you here?

406
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,830
Didn't you tell me to observe him?

407
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,630
I'll check out the path ahead.

408
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,880
Sang Tian.

409
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,100
Thank you for this morning.

410
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,660
Don't mention it. It's no big deal.

411
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,610
To express my gratitude...

412
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,410
I'll help you with the flags!

413
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,610
It's so cold.

414
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,910
That's right. It's very windy.

415
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,250
[You fool.]

416
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
[She's given you such an obvious hint.]

417
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,450
[You should be giving her your gloves.]

418
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,670
Put these on. Don't catch a cold.

419
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,520
Here. I'll do it myself.

420
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,120
Look. I'm sure he likes me.

421
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,730
No way. I have to tell him.

422
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,370
Otherwise, he's going to fall deeper.

423
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,930
You skipped your class to come here,
right?

424
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,140
-How did you know?
-Quickly get back to school.

425
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,250
No, it wasn't easy for me to slip out.

426
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,650
I don't want to go back.

427
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,130
-Pig Head.
-[Meng Na.]

428
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,330
[I'll give you half an hour
to come back to the class.]

429
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,130
[Or you're out
of the Figure Skating Department.]

430
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,610
Coach Xue is mad now.

431
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,570
Quickly go back.

432
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,810
All right then.

433
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,610
Keep Sang Tian company then.

434
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,570
-I'm leaving.
-See you.

435
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,270
You really want me to leave?

436
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,050
Why did she leave without saying a word?

437
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,820
What are you doing?

438
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,650
[Sang Tian, why are you being nervous?]

439
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,570
[Could you really have fallen for him?]

440
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,270
Thank you.

441
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,890
Do you expect to have the other one too?

442
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,950
Don't be too greedy.

443
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,070
Quickly put up the flags.

444
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,250
It's getting dark.

445
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,530
[Such a petty.]

446
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,780
[He's only lending one of his gloves.]

447
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,170
I don't like him.

448
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,210
I'll be right there!

449
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,460
I'll be right there!

450
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,270
-It's you.
-It's you.

451
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,850
Why is it you?

452
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,730
Why did you let go again?

453
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,250
I won't bicker at length with you
over the ice cream.

454
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,850
But this jacket? I bought it in the sale.

455
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,180
The price has gone back up.
You need to pay me the original price.

456
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,770
Do you know how expensive
this woolen coat is?

457
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,380
Come on. You didn't watch
where you were going...

458
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,850
and came out of nowhere.

459
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,930
I haven't asked you for compensation.
The wool...

460
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,990
If you hadn't worn knockoff goods,

461
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,890
will I tear it so easily?

462
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,290
-Whose wearing knockoff goods?
-You!

463
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,210
I think everything on you
is knockoff goods.

464
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,690
I... You...

465
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,030
I'm in a hurry!
I'll let you off this time.

466
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,690
Don't let me see you again!

467
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,930
My jacket.

468
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,250
[Hello, Tian Tian?]

469
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,570
[How did it go with the field trip?]

470
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,210
I have no confidence.

471
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,410
So dispirited?

472
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,410
[Ten kilometres for two round trips.]

473
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,130
There is no place to drink and rest.

474
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,170
Also, we have to complete it
within 50 minutes to qualify.

475
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,330
[How will I not be discouraged?]

476
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,730
Tian Tian.

477
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,290
Why don't you goof off?]

478
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,450
[I used to do that
during military training.]

479
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,930
Then, I would slip back
when no one was looking.

480
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,330
[No one found out.]

481
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,500
Is that all right?

482
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,010
Why not? You're a girl.

483
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,610
[Such high-intensity training
is meant for the guys.]

484
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,370
[How could you possibly endure it?]

485
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,050
[What if you failed?]

486
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,450
-Hey, Sang Tian.
-Hi.

487
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,470
Sang Tian!

488
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,270
-Wen Bing is still upstairs.
-I'm here to see you.

489
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,610
Me?

490
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,330
I just want to say thank you.

491
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,360
-It's no big deal. Don't mention it.
-No, I want to thank you...

492
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,450
for liking me.

493
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,170
I know you'll be upset to hear this.

494
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,010
But for the sake of our friendship,
I have to get things straight with you.

495
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,970
You're a nice guy.

496
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,680
But it's impossible between us.

497
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,490
-Say no more.
-I...

498
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,930
I'm not interested in you.

499
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,490
You won't get me.

500
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,130
-Actually...
-[Why does it sound so familiar?]

501
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,210
-[They're indeed a perfect match.]
-I can introduce other girls if you like.

502
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,130
-For instance, Sasa.
-It's fine.

503
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,980
-I already have someone I like.
-What?

504
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,990
Who is it?

505
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,040
Do I know her?

506
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,780
No, you don't know her.

507
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,740
What are you talking about?

508
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,140
Sang Tian said...

509
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,010
Coach Ma asked us to hurry.

510
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,570
That's all. Let's go.

511
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,740
Bye!

512
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,290
Who does he like?

513
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,640
He has a crush?

514
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,130
It's ten kilometres long.

515
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,210
Run three laps.

516
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,290
Those with unsatisfactory performances
will be punished.

517
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,080
The one who comes last...

518
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,560
will have to leave the team.

519
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,250
Understood?

520
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,130
-Understood.
-Understood.

521
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,490
Understood?

522
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,970
-Understood!
-Understood!

523
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,010
Ready!

524
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,090
Doing it for real?

525
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,250
Monitor, what's the matter?

526
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,330
Having an upset stomach?

527
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,930
That's not to be taken lightly.

528
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,070
It might be appendicitis.

529
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,170
It requires surgery.

530
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,650
It's not that serious. Go on.

531
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,850
I'll catch up later.

532
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,930
Are you sure?

533
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,650
-Do you need...
-No.

534
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,930
Go for it! Don't get hold up
because of me. Keep it up!

535
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,770
He's so troublesome.

536
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,480
He almost put a spoke in my wheel.

537
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,010
Good thing I came up
with a countermeasure yesterday.

538
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,910
It's a ten-kilometre run.

539
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,250
What a joke. I'll surely come last
and get kicked out for sure.

540
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,600
I'm the smart one.

541
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,050
Why are you here?

542
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,570
I have an upset stomach too.

543
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,650
What a coincidence.

544
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,850
I'll let you have this spot.

545
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,410
You're lying.

546
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,640
I'm not.

547
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,210
Why are you being so nervous?

548
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,480
We're on the same boat now.
We should help one another.

549
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,030
Right, monitor?

550
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,690
That's right.

551
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,770
We should help one another.

552
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,030
Someone is here.

553
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,930
Hide.

554
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,610
-I...
-I heard that there’s someone you like.

555
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,840
It's none of your business
whether or not I like anyone.

556
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,770
Were you the one
who told Meng Na that I like her?

557
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,050
Don't simply accuse me of that.

558
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,489
You're the one who's flirting around.

559
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,489
-Don't put it on me.
-It must be you. You jerk...

560
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,040
What are you doing?

561
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,490
Chop, chop. Let's set out.

562
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,690
Where did you two come from?

563
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,490
We've been behind you.

564
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,150
Why didn't I notice?

565
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,090
Xiao Xiao, you're so awesome.

566
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,130
You're probably too focused on running.

567
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,330
That's right, Xiao Xiao.
Why are you so awesome?

568
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,490
You could run this fast
when you've just been discharged.

569
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,210
-Let's go, Sang Tian.
-Let's go for it!

570
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,400
Let's go.

571
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,500
After coming to Liuye,

572
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,290
I've never won the first place,
not even once.

573
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,850
I must get the first place
for today's training.

574
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,070
Get out of the way!

575
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,900
Wei Lian!

576
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,070
-Wei Lian.
-Wei Lian, how are you?

577
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,770
-Are you all right?
-Wei Lian.

578
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,390
How is it?

579
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,620
How is it? Did you get hurt?

580
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,810
I'm fine. You should continue.

581
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,320
Be careful.

582
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,550
Go on.

583
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,890
Let's go.

584
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,370
-Let's go.
-Are you really all right?

585
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,450
I'm fine. Go on. Hurry.

586
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,960
But...

587
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,170
This is Wei Lian we're talking about.
You don't have to worry about him.

588
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,170
You should just worry
about yourself instead. Let's go.

589
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,230
What are you trying to do?

590
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,400
Wei Lian didn't catch up.

591
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,760
I need to check on him.

592
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,050
Our results for cultural class
have been nullified.

593
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,380
If we come last in training,

594
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,720
we might be expelled.

595
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,630
I can't just leave him behind.

596
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,990
Wei Lian.

597
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,920
Sang Tian, why did you come back?

598
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,810
I can't just leave you behind.

599
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,930
How does a Pomeranian carry a Husky?

600
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,880
Stop making sarcastic remarks.

601
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,150
Hey, I'm all right.

602
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,250
Look.

603
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,410
It's just a minor injury. I'm all right.

604
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,130
Look. I can walk on my own.

605
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,220
Wei Lian.

606
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,440
I'll leave Wei Lian to you.

607
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,500
Wen Bing, why don't you go ahead?

608
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,240
I don't want to be a drag to you.

609
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,640
If the worst comes to the worst,
I'll just be expelled.

610
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,200
You won't be expelled.

611
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,790
All of you...

612
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,970
Let's go.

613
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,530
-We'll keep you company.
-That's right.

614
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,160
-We'll do it together.
-We'll do it together.

615
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,490
Let's go.

616
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,210
Do you now know why we won't be expelled?

617
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,490
That's because all of us come last.

618
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,730
None of you passed.

619
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,520
The entire team
failed the first assessment.

620
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,780
You're the worse team I have ever coached.

621
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:37,800
Coach.

622
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,570
It's all on me.

623
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,970
Just punish me alone.

624
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,670
Coach Ma, it's not like that.

625
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,800
Wei Lian injured his leg.

626
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,810
-So...
-So, as the monitor...

627
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,390
you egged everyone on
to rebel together, huh?

628
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,540
I know I was wrong, Coach Ma.

629
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,090
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

630
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,250
That's for sure.

631
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,090
But...

632
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,500
as a monitor...

633
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,050
you've done quite a nice job.

634
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,950
When your teammate fell behind,

635
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,370
you didn't give up on him.

636
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,030
You used your own way
to encourage everyone...

637
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,950
to stand united
and work together as a team.

638
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,480
But next time,

639
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,000
I hope you'll advance together...

640
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,460
not retreat.

641
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Understood?

642
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,950
-Yes!
-Yes!

643
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,150
Also...

644
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,450
Wen Bing.

645
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,370
Do you know
why I have to punish Sang Tian?

646
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,080
I don't know.

647
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,920
[Sang Tian, why are you here?]

648
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,770
[You know each other?]

649
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,690
[She took the exam
for the Figure Skating Department.]

650
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,370
[You...]

651
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,170
[You're a girl?]
