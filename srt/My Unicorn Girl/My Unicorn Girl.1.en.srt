Don't you think my bangs are messy?

165
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,880
[Anyone has tissue paper?]

166
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
[I need to take a leak. Wait for me.]

167
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,280
[Why should I hide?]

168
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,540
[Is it a little sticky?]

169
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,920
Why are you in the women's toilet?

170
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
That should be my line.

171
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,520
Let me tell you.

172
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
My nickname is Koi.

173
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm always lucky.

174
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,160
I promise that I can provide you
a solution within ten seconds.

175
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,760
You need to believe me, okay?

176
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,880
One,

177
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,800
two,

178
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,960
Ten.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,160
It’s a man or woman?

180
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,520
This must be a man.

181
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
Why are you here?

182
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
[It's not like what you think.]

183
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
[Let me explain.]

184
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,220
Let me explain, okay?

185
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,140
-I...
-Pervert.

186
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,100
[Come out.]

187
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,600
-[Come out.]
-[Pervert.]

188
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,280
[You must make it clear!]

189
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,520
[Why are you here?]

190
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,320
Make it clear now.

191
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,000
You must make it clear here.

192
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,160
Otherwise, we will call the police.

193
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Make it clear to us.

194
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,120
Let me explain.

195
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,560
I'll explain.

196
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,240
I said she's a woman.

197
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,960
-A woman.
-Why does she turn out to be a woman?

198
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Sisters,

199
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,440
I am a coser.

200
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,170
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

201
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,730
I thought you're a man.

202
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,120
Goodbye.

203
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,120
Jerk.

204
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,960
Don't let me see you again!

205
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,080
Hi, please take a look.

206
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,760
Luckily, I'm a smart and clever girl...

207
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,120
who's able to turn
calamities into blessings.

208
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,520
Otherwise, I would be in hot water
because of that jerk.

209
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,880
When I get to know his name,
I won't ever let him go.

210
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,820
Excuse me, what do you
think about Qianbei Team?

211
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,410
They're respectable opponents of mine.

212
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,920
Wen Bing, I have
the last question for you.

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
Based on your
excellent results in this league,

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,160
getting into Liuye Sports University...

215
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,800
[Why is it him again?]

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,640
That's also our champion team.

217
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,600
So may I know what is your choice?

218
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,160
You will know it by then.

219
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,080
Wen Bing?

220
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
What do you want to say to them?

221
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,680
Excuse me.

222
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,600
Let's end today's interview here.

223
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,400
Thank you for paying
so much attention to Wen Bing.

224
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
It's time to go report
to Shuren University.

225
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,600
Thank you all.

226
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Thank you, everyone.

227
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,760
Thank you all.

228
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,040
That's all for today.

229
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,990
Brother Wen Bing.

230
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,480
Brother Wen Bing.

231
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,380
Brother Wen Bing.

232
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,860
I also got admitted to
Shuren School of Business.

233
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,410
Meng Na,

234
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,450
haven't you been learning figure skating?

235
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,280
In order to be your schoolmate,

236
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,600
I didn't attend Liuye's entrance exam.

237
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,890
I'm so happy when thinking of...

238
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,680
spending 4-year university life with you.

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,370
Brother Wen Bing,
can we take a photo together?

240
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,810
-Take with my phone, okay?
-Okay.

241
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,620
It turns out they are buddies.

242
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,700
[What a trick.]

243
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,300
Why are you like this?

244
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,180
-I...
-It's just a mobile phone.

245
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,740
She didn't spoil it on purpose.

246
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,300
Meng Na, let's take a photo
together again next time.

247
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,920
Okay. I...

248
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,740
He broke the phone himself
in order to get away.

249
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,220
How dare he still
pretends to be a gentleman?

250
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,660
Sure enough, he's a black-hearted villain.

251
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,180
Wait a minute.

252
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,680
This is his money.

253
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,260
I have to spend it quickly then.

254
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,420
Miss, let me buy as much
milk tea as I can from you.

255
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,210
Tian Tian, where did
you get so much money?

256
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,940
This is not the point.

257
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,619
The point is...

258
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,180
I was admitted to Liuye.

259
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,180
I was admitted to Liuye!

260
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,060
Tian Tian,

261
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,100
you're finally admitted to Liuye!

262
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,220
That's great.

263
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,460
After you entered Liuye,

264
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,260
I, Fang Xiao Rou, will treat you
milk tea as much as you want.

265
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,260
Keep your promise.

266
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,780
I don't have to go to that
all-male field any more.

267
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,300
I can be a pretty girl completely.

268
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,140
Tian Tian,

269
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,130
in fact, you're a really great sister.

270
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,490
In order to take care of Sang Zhan,

271
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,300
you dress like a boy every day...

272
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,700
to make money on the field.
It must be hard for you.

273
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,940
It's fine.

274
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,980
Sang Zhan loves to play games,

275
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,580
but fortunately, he makes me proud...

276
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,140
by getting admitted to
Shuren School of Business.

277
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,900
After all, our family's genes are good.

278
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,940
Correct.

279
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,500
He should have reported to
Shuren School of Business by now.

280
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,740
It's about the time.

281
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,610
Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.

282
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,460
[Sister, your dearest brother is
going to start his university life soon.]

283
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,580
[So I have to attend
the farewell fight today.]

284
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,740
[Please help me with
the freshman's registration today.]

285
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Please.

286
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,310
[Shuren School of Business]

287
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,420
[How about it?]

288
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,060
Have you completed
the freshman's registration?

289
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,180
All done.

290
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,100
I'll have dinner with the dean
tomorrow evening.

291
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,820
I'll greet them on your behalf...

292
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,140
and also inquire about
the student exchange program.

293
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,260
[All right.]

294
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,380
Today is your first day at university.

295
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,980
It is important to leave
a good impression to the others.

296
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,100
Especially the first impression
you give your teacher.

297
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,410
Why is your collar dirty?

298
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,460
I don't know when I got it dirty.

299
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,440
[You need to remember that...]

300
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,060
[you do not only
represent yourself in the future,]

301
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,420
you also represent Wen Group.

302
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,860
I will be more careful in the future.

303
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,100
Do you want to say hello to Cheng Min Jun?

304
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,020
-Hi, sister.
-[It's fine, I need to get back to work.]

305
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,140
That's all.

306
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,820
No.

307
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,740
What did she mean by "It's fine"?

308
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,740
I'm her biological brother.

309
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
She didn't even want to say hello to me.

310
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,540
I miss her.

311
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,340
Why do you call me by my full name?

312
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,140
Do you know how to respect your uncle?

313
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,710
Why did you make your collar dirty?

314
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,660
In her eyes,

315
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,780
there are no perfect
people and things in this world.

316
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,370
If I don't show flaws,

317
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,100
will she hang up the phone so quickly?

318
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,540
He's so smart.

319
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,900
This mother and son...

320
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,860
Wait for me.

321
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,770
[Sang Zhan]

322
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,340
You bring me troubles
on the first day of school.

323
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,470
This is your reward.

324
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,630
I wonder who's so unlucky
to be your roommate.

325
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,470
Good luck.

326
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,820
Good. This place is not bad.

327
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,700
All right.

328

I came to help Sister Xiao Rou out
at her milk tea's shop.

495
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,840
He isn't helping.
He's causing me troubles.

496
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,930
Hello, sister. Have you prepared dinner?

497
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,770
-[I'm going to starve to death.]
-I...

498
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,730
I...

499
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,490
You wish!

500
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,010
I reported to university on your behalf.

501
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,690
You still want me to prepare
food and drink for you?

502
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,730
You shall stay in dormitory today.
Don't ever come back.

503
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,850
[What if you miss me?]

504
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,450
[Hello.]

505
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,920
[Hello.]

506
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,330
[Sister, are you listening to me?]

507
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,410
[Hello.]

508
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,090
[Sister.]

509
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,650
[Sister, what's wrong?]

510
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,050
I'm going to prepare
for my studies in Liuye.

511
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,650
I don't have time for you.

512
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,690
All right. That's all for now.

513
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,170
I'm going to have dinner
with my classmates.

514
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,200
Bye
