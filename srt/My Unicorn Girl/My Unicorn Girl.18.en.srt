You can't hit me!

00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,390
Come back!

7
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,630
You asked for it!

8
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,470
It's his birthday tomorrow.

9
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,710
Good morning, students.

10
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,150
I am going to talk about
the foundation of software.

11
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,870
Please turn to page 12.

12
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,870
This topic is the compulsory question
in the National Computer Examination.

13
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,110
Let's start with the calculation
and the combination of data.

14
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,190
Open the book.

15
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,510
In computer science,

16
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,830
the calculation is known as
computer algorithm. In other words,

17
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,870
the calculation is made by computer.

18
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,550
From what I see,

19
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,750
your arm is not dislocated.

20
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,350
You are paralysed.

21
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,750
I want to drink water.

22
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,990
The solution can be calculated.

23
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,350
Sure.

24
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,350
Different people can invent
different software...

25
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,350
to solve the same problem.

26
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,350
There are two problems.

27
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,110
The first problem is closely
related to calculation.

28
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,190
Pay attention.

29
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,829
The second problem is...

30
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,790
related to the designation and technical
problem with the application.

31
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,630
Calculation and application
is closely related.

32
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,110
The rules of calculation are finite.

33
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,310
The solution to certain problems
is formulated.

34
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,870
The solution...

[Meet me at Kissme Milk Tea at noon.]

36
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,310
[See you.]

37
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,310
[Come alone.]

Is she inviting me?

40
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,910
Analysis, coding,

41
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,829
test, debugging,

42
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,470
and counting time...

43
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,280
Let's go for pizza.

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,440
I have to go.

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,310
-I have yearned for pizza for a while.
-Sure, I will follow you.

46
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,390
I have to go too.

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,520
Where are you going?

48
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,110
You injured your hand, not your legs.

49
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,790
You have to go back by yourself.
I have something to do.

50
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,670
Bye.

51
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,110

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,910

-Yes!

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,110
Hold on! I am coming!

57
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,710
Hello, Xue Fei.

58
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,190
Which table is Mr Du whom
you are introducing to me at?

59
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,550
He is at table A10.

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,710
He is waiting for you.

61
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,750
Excuse me, I am...

62
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,190
late.

63
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,510
It's okay.

64
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,430
Girls have the right to be late...

65
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,070
especially beautiful girls like you.

66
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,550
Sweet talker.

67
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,510
Why are you here?

68
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,190
I am the Min in Du Min Jun...

69
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,950
the Jun in Du Min Jun.

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,550
My name is Du Min Jun Si.

71
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,510
You are shameless.

72
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,070
Excuse me, Du Min Jun.

73
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,590
Chen Chen.

74
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,990
Chen Chen, please forgive me, okay?

75
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,430
I had to beg Coach Xue...

76
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,590
to let us meet each other.

77
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,990
Please take a seat and talk to me.

78
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,230
Just a moment ago,

79
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,150
I ordered the most expensive Wagyu beef
in the restaurant.

80
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,350
Xue Fei.

81
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,190
Stop meddling in my affairs!

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,670
Yes, don't let her meddle in your affairs.

83
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,670
Just imagine having Wagyu beef
in your mouth.

84
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,470
My goodness!

85
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,630
-Chen Chen! Chen Chen!
-Mr Du.

86
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,350
This is your Wagyu beef.

87
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,630
That's our plate!

88
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,310
Take away, please.

89
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,630
Sure. You have to pay for the container.
It's two dollars.

90
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,110
Put it inside a plastic bag.

91
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,070
Two layers of plastic bag, please.

92
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,150
Don't forget about the sauce.
Don't forget about it!

93
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,310
Chen Chen!

94
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,909
-Hello!
-Hello!

95
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,710
Are you surprised?

96
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,790
All of you are here.

97
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,470
Wei Lian. Have a seat!

98
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,470
Sang Tian.

99
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,030
What happened? Why is everyone here?

100
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,670
Why is Wen Bing not here?

101
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,790
Are we going on a trip...

102
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,230
without him again?

103
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,270
You are right.

104
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,030
This time, we must hide it from him.

105
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,310
If we don't bring him along,

106
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,350
he will get mad.

107
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,630
Sang Tian, what happened?
Don't make me curious. Tell me!

108
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,470
I want to gather everyone...

109
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,790
to surprise him on his birthday.

110
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,270
-Birthday surprise?
-Birthday surprise?

111
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,790
How do you know his birth date?

112
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,870
It's on the 12th of January.

113
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,150
He is a Capricorn.

114
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,470
No wonder he is so scary.

115
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,950
What's wrong with Capricorn?

116
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,750
Capricorns are almost flawless...

117
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,950
but they are narcissistic.

118
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,630
There is another thing.

119
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,990
Their mood is always unstable.

120
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,350
In short, they are moody.

121
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,030
That is why...

122
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,950
we have to keep it a secret.
Don't let him know about it. Okay?

123
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,990
-Yes.
-Yes.

124
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,510
Especially you, Xiao Xiao,
"Dandelion of Liuye".

125
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,070
I will try my best.

126
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,870
Why do you call him
"Dandelion of Liuye"?

127
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,270
When there is wind,

128
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,950
dandelion seeds will fly everywhere.

129
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,150
Wait for me.

130
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,830
-"The Plan to put Bing down"?
-"The Plan to put Bing down"?

131
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,150
I am going to introduce your nickname.

132
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,390
Listen carefully.

133
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,390
Sang Tian's code is "Hibiscus".

134
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,590
Wei Lian's code is...

135
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,870
-"Silly Husky".
-"Silly Husky".

136
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,670
-Li He's code is "Groot".
-Groot.

137
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,390
Xiao Xiao's code is "Dandelion".

138
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,440
-Dandelion?
-Dandelion?

139
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,600
The name suits you well, isn't it?

140
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,110
Huang Hao Ran,

141
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,430
your code is "Super Mary".

142
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,750
"Super Mary"?

143
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,510
Each code is specially designed for you.
Can you remember your name?

144
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,910
Yes.

145
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,910
She is not far away.

146
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,590
Where did she go?

147
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,070
The enemy is calling!

148
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,110
Now, we are going to distribute the tasks.

149
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,490
Super Mary, you will be in
charge of the venue.

150
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,910
Make sure the venue is
clear at seven o'clock.

151
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,870
Dandelion, you are in charge of shopping.
I will send you the list later.

152
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,950
Groot, you are in charge of
decorating the venue.

153
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,950
Okay.

154
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,510
Silly Husky and I are in charge of
the banner, materials, and cake.

155
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,870
Are you clear about your tasks?

156
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,190
-Yes!
-Yes!

157
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,630
Okay. Let's confirm the time.

158
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,280
It's 12:15 now.

159
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,880
Grab some food after the meeting. We will
meet up at 1 p.m. to decorate the venue.

160
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,790
Get it?

161
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,230
-Yes.
-Stand up.

162
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,640
Let's go start work separately.

163
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:47,430
Our class monitor will be so touched
that he will cry out loud.

164
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,590
All the best!

165
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Dismiss!

166
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,440
-Dismiss!
-Hurry up!

167
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,610
We have a great responsibility and we are
running out of time! All the best!

168
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,510
Go, Pikachu!

169
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,990
Sang Tian.

170
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,950
We are finally in a group.

171
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,900
Finally?

172
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,030
Yes. If it weren't for Wen Bing, we would
be in the same group on the last trip.

173
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,310
You mean the time you were
poisoned by Super Mary?

174
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,350
Yes.

175
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,870
No one but you knows that
I am sensitive to the banana.

176
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,190
Wei Lian, we have to prepare banner,
materials and cake in the afternoon.

177
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,950
Which one should we start?

178
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,590
How about starting from baking a cake?

179
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,670
I am not familiar with baking.

180
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,910
Don't worry, leave it to me. Let's go.

181
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,550
Sure!

182
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,550
[Sorry.]

183
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,990
[The number you have dialed is...]

184
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,190
How dare you not pick up my phone call?

185
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,990
Cheng Min Jun.

186
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,150
When you have found Sang Tian,
bring her to me.

187
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,270
-Stop! The balloon has flown away!
-Wei Lian, help!

188
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,310
Tie it properly. It's flying away.

189
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,070
-You are right.
-Use this.

190
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,710
-Sure.
-Hurry up.

191
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,670
-How are things going?
-It's almost done.

192
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,590
Hurry up!

193
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,590
We didn't buy enough materials.

194
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,910
-It's all pressed.
-Hold on, cut this.

195
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,350
This one. Just cut it following the trace.

196
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,950
Young Master, I was busy.

197
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,230
I will go now.

198
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,550
Never mind, continue with your work.

199
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,750
I will look for her by myself.

200
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,950
Level One Alarm. Wen Bing is coming!

201
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,830
-Hurry up!
-Put down the balloons!

202
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,360
Hurry up!

203
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
-Don't forget this!
-Okay!

204
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,550
Stop!

205
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,350
I will deal with Wen Bing.

206
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,310
All of you go on with the plan. Okay?

207
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,070
-Okay.
-Okay.

208
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,070
Hurry up!

209
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,750
What are you doing here?

210
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,710
I...

211
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,990
You...

212
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,150
You called me so many times.
Anything urgent?

213
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,910
It's such a small matter.

214
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,710
Everything about me is a big deal.

215
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,630
Let's go. Let me apply medicine for you.

216
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,750
Let's go!

217
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,950
Is it painful?

218
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,910
Why is she so obedient all of a sudden?

219
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,150
Done.

220
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,590
Done.

221
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,950
It's time to feed your pet fish.

222
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,790
[Summoning Hibiscus. I am Silly Husky.]

223
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,470
[Dandelion says that we don't have
enough balloons.]

224
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,910
[Get 100 more.]

225
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,790
[Help us out!]

226
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,590
Are you hiding something from me?

227
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,070
-No.
-Then why are you being sneaky?

228
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,990
You look nervous even when
you are reading messages.

229
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,130
Not only you didn't
pick me up after class,

230
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,230
you didn't answer my call too.

231
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,550
What are you doing?

232
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,710
I...

233
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,710
To be honest,

234
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,670
you are having a relapse.

235
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,310
I will take care of you as I am held
responsible for it. Don't worry.

236
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,510
However, I don't have to report to you all
the time about my whereabouts, right?

237
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,590
I don't want you to report to me
all the time.

238
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,750
That's because I need a babysitter
as I am handicapped now.

239
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,030
Most of the time you are unreachable.

240
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,110
It makes me think that you are...

241
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,030
irresponsible.

242
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,710
Fine. I promise...

243
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,030
from now on, I will be available
24 hours a day.

244
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,990
I will never switch off my phone.
How do you like it?

245
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,910
That's acceptable.

246
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,350
Young Master Wen, do you need anything?

247
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,150
Switch on the computer.
I want to watch videos.

248
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,790
Sure.

249
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,510
What is the password?

250
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,910
It's 123456.

251
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,150
Okay.

252
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,510
Young Master Wen,

253
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,230
I have accomplished my mission.

254
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,830
Can I take a nap?

255
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,830
Thank you, Young Master Wen.
Have fun watching videos.

256
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,310
Have a nice day.

257
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,630
Good afternoon. I am going to take a nap.

258
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,110
Wen Bing, the silly boy.

259
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,750
He tried to trap me.

260
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,790
I escaped like a cicada
casting off its skin.

261
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,550
It's my own fault. Why do I behave like
a thief when I just want to surprise him?

262
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,190
Men are trouble.

263
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,390
People used to tell me that
I look like a Husky.

264
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,910
I am presenting myself to both of you.

265
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,590
It symbolises the beginning of
our friendship.

266
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,550
It does look like Wei Lian.

267
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,830
Since we are friends,

268
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,230
everyone should have it.

269
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,590
Please pack it.

270
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,830
-I want to give it as a present.
-Sure.

271
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,790
-Wei Lian, I have bought the balloons.
-Have you packed it?

272
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,470
-I am in a rush.
-See you at the cafeteria at 3 p.m.

273
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,270
-Is it done?
-Yes.

274
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,390
-Take it.
-Sure.

275
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,230
Scan to pay.

276
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,630
Thank you.

277
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,350
It's been two hours.
Why is she still sleeping?

278
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,750
Sang Tian.

279
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,630
Time to wake up.

280
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,110
You have been sleeping for two hours.

281
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,710
Sang Tian.

282
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,990
Sang Tian!

283
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,589
Why are you here?

284
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,670
Where is your brother?

285
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,790
How do I know?

286
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,869
Why are you here?

287
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,670
I stayed up the whole night to play games.

288
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,750
I am so sleepy.

289
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,270
The hostel of Shuren School of Business
is under renovation.

290
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,349
I can't sleep there.

291
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,829
I am here...

292
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,190
to take a nap in his bed.

293
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,310
What's wrong?

294
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,430
You may continue sleeping.

295
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,270
I have been waiting for her
for so long...

296
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,190
and she played me as a fool.

297
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,790
She made use of her brother to trick me.

298
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,270
Wen Bing!

299
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,510
Happy birthday!

300
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,010
How did you know?

301
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,710
You will know everything about someone
when you care about him.

302
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,350
Is it?

303
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,230
Of course.

304
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,670
You must have received
many presents, right?

305
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,510
If I didn't have to go to class
in the morning,

306
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,070
I would be the first person to wish you a happy birthday.

307
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,030
It's okay.

308
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,390
Though I am not the first person
but I am the most sincere one.

309
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,230
Thank you.

310
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,150
Sang Tian!

311
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,510
Sang Tian has prepared
a present for you too.

312
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,870
I have training in the afternoon.

313
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,630
I have to go.

314
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,750
Bye. I have to go.

315
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,630
Bye.

316
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,550
-I have something to do.
-Hey!

317
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,670
Babysitter!

318
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,270
Please enjoy the food.

319
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,550
Please lower your voice!

320
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,430
Sit down.

321
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,470
Will you please stop embarrassing me?

322
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,670
What is that?

323
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,630
What are you hiding?

324
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,870
There is nothing to hide.

325
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,270
I am keeping it away from the oily table.

326
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,430
The package is not important.

327
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,790
What matters is the sincerity.

328
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,030
The package is important.

329
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,270
It's handpicked!

330
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,630
You know nothing.

331
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,150
What are you doing?

332
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,350
Don't open it!

333
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,790
-Why can't I open it?
-It's a gift for Wei Lian!

334
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,870
Who are you to open the gift?

335
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,990
What?

336
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,670
Sang Tian!

337
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,990
Wei Lian!

338
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,910
Wen Bing?

339
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,670
What is he doing here?

340
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,110
The plan has changed.

341
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,150
I will send him away.

342
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,270
Wait for me at the milk tea store.

343
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,150
Okay.

344
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,030
This is for you.

345
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,630
For me?

346
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,830
So I have a present too?

347
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,350
-Do you like it?
-Thank you, Sang Tian!

348
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,390
You are welcome.

349
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,870
We are running out of time. Go now!

350
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,790
I shall make a move.

351
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,630
Wen Bing.

352
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,630
I am leaving.

353
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,630
Bye.

354
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,350
Go now!

355
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,990
You want a present too?

356
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,870
I am sorry. I didn't
prepare a gift for you.

357
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,030
Next time.

358
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:38,310
I will prepare a present for you next time
to celebrate your speedy recovery.

359
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,790
How do you like it?

360
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,270
I don't want it.

361
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,390
Fine.

362
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,870
My brother is still sleeping in my dorm.

363
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,430
I have to go. Bye!

364
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,390
Dorm?

365
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,110
Sleeping?

366
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,350
Her brother?

367
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,990
Nephew!

368
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,870
Nephew!

369
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,830
I am sorry, Nephew.

370
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,950
Something urgent came up.

371
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,550
I am sorry!
I am late as something urgent came up.

372
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,430
Why is there a present?

373
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,710
Whose present is this?
Is it your birthday?

374
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,350
[How could I forget something
so important?]

375
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,110
[It's Chen Chen's fault as
she refuses to forgive me!]

376
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,990
[I was not at peace because of her.]

377
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,310
[No way. I have to prepare
a present for my nephew.]

378
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,310
-What is this?
-It's your birthday present.

379
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,350
Your birthday and your mom's birthday
is two days apart.

380
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,550
I remember it.

381
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,870
By the way, why is your mom
going back to Singapore in a rush?

382
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,470
She should have left after
celebrating your birthday.

383
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,510
There's no need.

384
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,710
You are right.

385
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,630
Her leaving is the
best birthday present for you.

386
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,990
Check out my present.

387
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,630
I am allergic to dogs.

388
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,750
Both of you are so similar.

389
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,270
I mean...

390
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,480
You are mentally allergic to dogs,
not physically.

391
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,350
You don't have to be scared.

392
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,070
Furthermore, your mom
is living in Singapore.

393
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,870
Why don't you get a pet
to keep you company?

394
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,990
Get a puppy.

395
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,630
How about a Husky?

396
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,990
Not only it's cute, but it is also silly.

397
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,870
I have got a name for the puppy.

398
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,910
How about...

399
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,910
Wei Lian?

400
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,970
What do you think?

401
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,350
A royalty’s name.

402
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,270
A Husky...

403
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,350
called Wei Lian?

404
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,070
It's elegant.

405
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,030
There's money inside!

406
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,030
My dear nephew.

407
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,470
It's impossible.

408
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,430
We are just friends.

409
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,190
Yes, just friends.

410
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,270
Even if she likes me,

411
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,510
it's only a friend's love.

412
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,350
I don't care. I shall open it.

413
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,190
Ti amo?

414
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,070
Ti amo.

415
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,640
[Translating "Ti amo"]

416
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:35,620
[Te amo means I love you]

417
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,910
She...

418
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,230
She really likes me.

419
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,110
Meng Na and my uncle prepared presents
for me. How come you don't know?

420
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,030
Not only you didn't prepare a gift for me,
you gave Wei Lian one in front of me.

421
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,030
I am...Wen Bing.

422
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,750
Ti amo.

423
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,190
It's not given by Sang Tian.

424
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,830
Don't misunderstand!

425
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,830
Italian?

426
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,750
I like you?

427
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,110
What?

428
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,670
Sang Tian, I am late.

429
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,830
Why are you so late?

430
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,510
I was stuck in traffic.

431
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,710
We might be late to the class at 7 p.m.

432
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,550
Sang Tian.

433
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,150
Look at my scarf.

434
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,390
Wei Lian, it's not convenient to wear
a scarf when you work.

435
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,710
-No.
-Take it away.

436
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,030
Okay.

437
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,390
Put on the apron.

438
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,150
Put your hands here.

439
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,150
-Turn around.
-Sang Tian, please tie it for me.

440
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,550
Wei Lian, put on the gloves
and help me out.

441
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,510
-It's over there.
-Sure.

442
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,190
I'll make you regret it.

443
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,950
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

444
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,870

460
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,750
Take a look at what
we have prepared for you!

461
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,390
Wen Bing, this cake is baked by
me and Sang Tian.

462
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,510
Do you like it?

463
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,310
I made a helmet for you.

464
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,590
I made you a shirt. Does it fit?

465
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,350
I prepared the sticker.
It looks like you, right?

466
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,990
I have spent a long time
to prepare the stick.

467
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,310
Thank you!

468
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,870
-Make a wish.
-Yes, make a wish!

469
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,910
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

470
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,710
Happy birthday!

471
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,110
Thank you!

472
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,230
-Happy birthday!
-Wen Bing!

473
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,270
Check out my present for you!

474
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,510
-Let's cut the cake!
-Yes, it's my present to you.

475
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,950
I prepared the present for you.

476
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,670
Sang Tian, I really like the scarf
that you gave to me.

477
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,870
Scarf?

478
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,310
I didn't give you a scarf.

479
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,830
You didn't give it to me?

480
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,510
It must be a mistake! Wei Lian,
I gave you a Husky toy.

481
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,790
It's the same with Wen Bing's toy.

482
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,910
I will get it changed.

483
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,950
I am sorry.

484
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,750
It's okay.

485
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,910
No.

486
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,070
How about this?

487
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,550
I didn't write any card.

488
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,430
What is this?

489
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,150
Where is Wei Lian?

490
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,630
Wei Lian!

491
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,870
Come over here!

492
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,390
-Hurry up!
-I am coming.

493
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,510
Hurry up! What did you prepare?
Show us your present.

494
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,590
Yes, what did you prepare?

495
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,110
-How did I get the wrong one?
-Whose present is that?

496
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,110
Look.

497
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,550
You are so silly.

498
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,190
You even took the wrong present.

499
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,470
It's your fault. You kept a close watch
on me as if I am a thief.

500
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,190
I was so nervous that you would find out
about it and ruin the surprise.

501
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,790
Take a look. What does that mean?

502
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,870
It says...

503
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,590
In Italian, it means pig head.

504
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,190
It refers to you!

505
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,990
Teach me the pronounciation .

506
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,270
Ti amo.

507
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,470
Ti amo.

508
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,470
Ti amo.

509
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,830
Again.

510
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,430
Ti amo.

511
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,360
That's not accurate.

512
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,500
Ti amo.

513
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,500
-Ti amo.
-Again!

514
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,070
Ti amo.

515
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,370
Ti amo.

516
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,290
Thank you.

517
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,650
You are welcome.
Ti amo.

518
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,429
Chen Chen!

519
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,170
Such a coincidence.

520
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,230
Are you following me?

521
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,320
How is that possible?

522
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,120
It's fate.

523
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,550
Chen Chen!

524
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,639
Think about it.

525
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,090
There are so many convenience stores
in Qianbei.

526
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,690
Yet we shop at the same convenience store
at the same time.

527
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,260
Don't you think it's fate?

528
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,699
It's called bad fate.

529
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,600
How could you say that?

530
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,360
You shouldn't think like that.

531
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,270
Hello, it's 114 dollars in total.

532
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,470
You can pay in cash, by card,
by WeChat or Alipay.

533
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,650
I will pay by Alipay.

534
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,010
Okay, I will scan your phone.

535
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,500
I am sorry.
My phone ran out of battery.

536
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,990
No...

537
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,950
It's okay. I'll pay for it.

538
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,600
No need.

539
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,490
-I will put them back.
-You don't have to do that.

540
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,960
-Don't be shy.
-I am shy.

541
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,880
Don't treat me like a stranger.

542
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
I am treating you as a stranger.

543
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,280
-We are friends!
-I am not your friend!

544
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,680
So, in your heart,
we are more than friends.

545
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,610
I am sorry.

546
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,600
Hold on, miss.

547
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,150
Is this man...

548
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,910
not your friend?

549
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,980
-We are!
-We are not close.

550
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,430
How about this?

551
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,960
It doesn't cost much anyway.

552
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,880
It's on me.

553
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,390
No need!

554
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,430
If you insist on paying,

555
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,250
add me on Wechat and transfer
the money to my account.

556
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,440
Thank you.

557
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,090
Thank you.

558
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,220
Bye.

559
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,730
How can she simply add someone on Wechat?

560
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,690
Chen Chen! Wait for me, Chen Chen!

561
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,020
It's painful! Listen, I know martial art!

562
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,220
It's of no use. She wants to
stay away from you.

563
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,550
If you won't stop disturbing her,

564
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,660
I will report it to the police.

565
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,140
No one is disturbing her!

566
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,420
I have CCTV here.

567
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,460
Everything has been recorded.

568
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,550
How about this?

569
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,830
I shall call the police now.

570
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,750
No need.

571
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,110
Are you crazy?

572
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,520
It has been a while since I exercised.

573
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,670
Why are you lazying?

574
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,850
Open the present for me.

575
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,950
I am exhausted. Do it yourself.

576
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,160
I injured my arm because of you.

577
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,730
Yes, I forgot about it!

578
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,200
You injured your arm.

579
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,400
Let me have a look.

580
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,500
This...

581
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,930
Will you stop pretending already?

582
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,570
I am tired of playing along with you.

583
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,530
Since you know that I am pretending,

584
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,590
why didn't you expose me?

585
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,970
That's because I am a kind person.

586
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,050
I don't want to lower myself to
the standard of the birthday boy.

587
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,910
What birthday boy?

588
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,530
I didn't receive
any presents from someone.

589
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,720
Is my present so important to you?

590
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,460
Not very important.

591
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,160
Everyone else except you
prepared presents for me.

592
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,390
It shows that we don't share a close bond.

593
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,390
Stubborn.

594
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,280
It's for you.

595
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,820
Open it.

596
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,340
This is...

597
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,440
You still remember it.

598
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Of course. It was so cold and
you were so fashionable.

599
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,880
I remembered it instantly.

600
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,760
I didn't even blame you and you have
the cheeks to remind me of that.

601
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,690
Enough. Let's see if it fits. Hurry up!

602
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,800
Let's check the length of the sleeve.

603
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,320
The sleeve is slightly long.

604
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,120
But it is acceptable.

605
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,420
Do you like it?

606
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,790
It's acceptable.

607
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,430
What do you mean by that?

608
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,420
I took a long time to prepare it.

609
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,030
Did you knit it by yourself?

610
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,180
You bet!

611
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,190
Your sweater is so expensive.

612
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,560
I can't afford it even if I skip meals
for the whole semester.

613
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,770
Alright.

614
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,430
Since you put in so much of effort
to knit a sweater for me,

615
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,090
I shall forgive you.

616
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,870
However,

617
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,090
you are merely paying back the debt
because you ruined my sweater.

618
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,310
It's not considered as a present.

619
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,030
If you are truly sincere,

620
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,190
prepare another gift for me.

621
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,580
What do you want?

622
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,210
It would be meaningless...

623
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,800
if I tell you what I want.

624
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,100
What do you mean?

625
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,090
Thank you.

626
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,750
As long as you like it.

627
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,490
I think I am thinking too much.

628
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,710
She only sees me as a friend.

629
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,480
We...

630
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,360
Sang Tian!
