00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,440
Why are you in your clothes?

166
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,680
Why else? Do you not wear any clothes?

167
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,720
Then, why did you ask me
to get your towel?

168
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
It's for drying my hair.

169
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,280
You...

170
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
[Help me! I need to borrow your shampoo.]

171
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,600
[It's in the bathroom. Get it yourself.]

172
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,040
[Is there someone in the bathroom?]

173
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,120
[Sang Tian is taking a shower.]

174
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,040
[The lock is spoilt.
Just push the door open.]

175
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,800
Where is he?

176
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,010
Who are you talking about?

177
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Wei Lian.

178
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,450
Didn't he say he wants to
borrow the shampoo?

179
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,440
There's a bottle in my cupboard.

180
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,630
So, I gave it to him.

181
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,600
Then, why did you...

182
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,840
What did I do?

183
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,560
You tricked me.

184
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,800
This style of yours...

185
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
as well as your legs...

186
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,920
look nice.

187
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
What are you doing?

188
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,560
I need to tell you something.

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
I will sleepwalk at night.

190
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,160
I won't remember anything
when I wake up the next day.

191
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,160
I was afraid that I might scare you.

192
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
So I'd better let you know beforehand.

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,920
Goodnight.

194
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,360
What happened?
You didn't sleep well last night?

195
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,760
How do you have the nerve to ask?

196
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,440
Don't forget about
the assembly at 8 o'clock.

197
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,590
Looks like I have to be in defiance of
heaven's law and change my fate.

198
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,750
Be it a success or not,

199
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,540
I have to fight with all my might.

200
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,880
Maybe my luck will really change
after kissing him.

201
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,920
Then, I might be able to return to
the Figure Skating Department.

202
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,760
So, I won't have to live with
this jerk any more.

203
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,359
[Liuye Sports University]

204
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,359
Hey, Sang Tian.

205
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,319
Just got here?

206
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
-I'll get going first.
-Bye-bye.

207
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?

208
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,320
[I'll go out and pretend to faint.]

209
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,640
[He might be a jerk,
but he'd surely save me.]

210
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,650
[Once he becomes panic...]

211
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,400
[And gives me a
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation...]

212
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,080
[That's my chance to kiss him.]

213
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,110
[Perfect.]

214
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,880
[Yes.]

215
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,960
Sang Tian, are you all right?

216
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,720
Sang Tian, wake up.

217
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,760
[Why are you shaking me?]

218
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,520
[Just give me a
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.]

219
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,880
Sang Tian.

220
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,760
[Is the hint I'm giving
not obvious enough?]

221
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,280
Sang Tian.

222
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,440
I need oxygen.

223
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,800
I need mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

224
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,220
So, your heart and lungs
are not functioning well.

225
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,960
Let me check on the Internet.

226
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,440
"The first step to
cardiopulmonary resuscitation."

227
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,360
"On the lower third of the sternum."

228
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,450
"That means the centre of the chest."

229
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,120
"Press down by at least
5cm of depth into the chest."

230
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,640
"Lace the fingers of both hands together."

231
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,200
"Press down hard."

232
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
I got it.

233
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,410
One, two, three.

234
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,800
-I'm awake.
-You came round.

235
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,480
Did you really come round?
Are you feeling unwell?

236
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Shall I bring you to the school clinic?

237
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,960
There's no need.

238
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,920
I'm fine.

239
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,290
Her acting was good.

240
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,680
Everyone, stop for a while.

241
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,000
I have something to say.

242
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,760
I'll do away with formalities
and go straight to the point.

243
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,840
Who wants to be the monitor?

244
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,240
Me!

245
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,520
Xiao Xiao, you're enthusiastic.

246
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,120
Is there anyone else?

247
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,040
There's a hole in
the armpit of your jacket.

248
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
No way.

249
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,160
There's no hole.

250
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,920
Sang Tian, very good.

251
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,680
Is there anyone else?

252
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,080
How dare you trick me!

253
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
I think you have good leadership.

254
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
It would be a waste of your talent...

255
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,200
if you'd only boss me around
in the dormitory.

256
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,160
Do you have some kind of death wish?

257
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,050
Let's raise our hands to vote.

258
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,120
Hold on.

259
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,560
Do you want to be the monitor too?

260
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,420
No.

261
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,410
In order to become the monitor
of the ice hockey team,

262
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
I think he must someone highly capable.

263
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,080
If we consider our
entrance examination results,

264
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,320
I think Sang Tian is suited for this role.

265
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,480
You are too talkative.

266
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,200
Enough. Raise your hands if you agree to
have Xiao Xiao as the monitor.

267
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,280
Raise your hands!

268
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,000
Three votes.

269
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,320
Raise your hands if you agree to
have Sang Tian as the monitor.

270
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,600
Put your hands down!

271
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,040
-Put it down.
-Put it down.

272
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,720
Great.

273
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
-Congratulations, Sang Tian.
-Coach Ma.

274
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,960
I don't want to be the monitor.

275
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,120
-I feel that Xiao Xiao is...
-Sang Tian.

276
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,680
You would be despising your opponent
if you declined out of modesty.

277
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,320
Shut your mouth.

278
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,640
You don't have to be modest and give in.

279
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,240
Let's have a competition
to see who's more capable.

280
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,560
Xiao Xiao, I...

281
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,680
What do you want to compete in?

282
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm in for any competition.

283
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,760
I'm better looking than you are.

284
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm taller than you too.

285
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,320
You'll lose in whatever we compete in.

286
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,510
How about Rock Paper Scissors?

287
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
Coach, this is too childish.

288
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,310
I don't think
there's anything wrong with it.

289
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,040
All right.
Let's compete in Rock Paper Scissors.

290
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
It'll be a one-set match.

291
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
-Are you guys ready?
-I'm ready.

292
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Okay.

293
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,680
If you really don't want
to be the monitor,

294
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,880
I have a way that guarantees you
to lose this game.

295
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,040
Really?

296
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,720
Show me one of your hands.

297
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,320
And then?

298
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
All right.

299
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,510
If you want to lose,
throw a rock in the game.

300
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,800
Don't ever throw scissors.

301
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,160
-Why?
-With that gesture you did,

302
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,440
Xiao Xiao must be thinking that
we are scheming against him.

303
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,790
He'd think that we want to
trick him into throwing scissors.

304
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,800
So, he'll guess that
you'll actually throw a rock.

305
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,280
Thus, he will throw a paper to defeat you.

306
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,360
This means that,

307
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,870
if I threw a rock, I'd be able to lose?

308
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,120
[You wouldn't be so kind-hearted.]

309
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,490
[You must be tricking me.]

310
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,000
[I won't believe you.]

311
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,160
-Are you guys ready?
-I'm ready.

312
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,520
Come on.

313
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,760
Rock Paper Scissors.

314
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,560
Coach, he was slow.

315
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,240
After a round of an exciting match,

316
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,240
I'll officially announce Sang Tian
to be the monitor.

317
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,790
[Why is she the only one
whom I can see clearly?]

318
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,320
You already know that she's a girl.

319
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,120
Why do you want to live with her?

320
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Is it because you're afraid that
other guys will bully her,

321
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,320
so you chose to live with her deliberately?

322
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,760
You want to protect her secretly.

323
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,280
I'm just on my guard against her.

324
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,320
On guard? What's there to guard against?

325
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,880
I didn't expect such a coincidence.
Who knew her brother would live there?

326
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,830
Where are you going?

327
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,920
He's so crafty.

328
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,760
He knew that I would not believe him.

329
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,280
So he deliberately tricked me
to throw scissors.

330
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,760
In the end, I won.

331
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,580
Don't you think he did this on purpose?

332
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,480
I'm so angry.

333
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,800
I must expose him at
Shuren School of Business.

334
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,520
Don't be angry, Tian Tian.

335
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
You and Wen Bing are roommates now.

336
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,840
You guys should live together in peace.
You should be on friendly terms with him.

337
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,570
I don't want to be
on friendly terms with him.

338
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
I feel angry when I see him.

339
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,800
Look at how angry you are.

340
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,940
I bet you can't kiss him.

341
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,840
How can you make fun of me
when I'm so angry?

342
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,560
This is an important matter
that helps you change your fate.

343
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,240
Your fate might change after you kiss him.

344
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,120
You can give it a try.

345
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,720
I've tried.

346
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,840
Seriously?

347
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,810
And then?

348
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,530
Nothing happened.

349
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
He almost took advantage of me.

350
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,040
No way. That's too dangerous, Tian Tian.

351
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,640
I didn't mean it. Don't listen to me.

352
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,320
Don't try it any more.

353
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,880
You might get into trouble.

354
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
Don't worry.

355
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,520
He wouldn't dare.

356
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,360
[Shuren University, Cheng Min Jun]

357
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,560
But, I still think it's dangerous.

358
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Don't worry.

359
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,040
I have to go to class.
Get back to your work now.

360
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,440
-Okay.
-I have to go to class.

361
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,480
I think it's that my period is coming

362
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,400
Hello.

363
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,850
[Sang Tian, where are you?]

364
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,880
[You have to be quick. Coach Ma
usually comes in 10 minutes earlier.]

365
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,250
[Anyone who arrives after her
is considered late.]

366
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,370
[She'll give punishments
regardless of reasons.]

367
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,760
Okay.

368
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,000
Hello.

369
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Are you Brother Wen Bing's classmate?

370
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,720
A friend of Brother Wen Bing
is my friend too.

371
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,880
I'm Meng Na.

372
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,440
I'm Sang Tian.

373
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,000
What are you looking for?

374
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,360
-Do you need my help?
-Nothing.

375
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
I don't need your help.

376
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm just looking around.

377
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,000
What's that in your hand?

378
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,040
-It's just a...
-Oh, facial masks.

379
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,880
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

380
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,640
Take it.

381
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,940
I'm making a move.
See you next time.

382
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,920
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

383
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,360
-Coach Ma, I...
-I'm not hearing any explanations.

384
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,840
Anyone who's late or
leaves early will be punished.

385
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,240
I won't accept any explanations.

386
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,640
Coach, I know I did wrong.

387
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,920
You're doubly wrong.

388
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,920
You're the monitor and yet you're late.

389
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
Your punishment is to be the goalkeeper.

390
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,920
-You have to defend 100 goals.
-100?

391
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,200
-That's too much.
-Yeah.

392
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,160
-That's too tough.
-No one would be able to do it.

393
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,100
Yeah.

394
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,990
Why? You can't do it?

395
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,230
All right then.

396
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,960
Go home now.

397
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,360
Liuye's team doesn't need you.

398
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,960
I can do it.

399
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,120
If any of you threw the game,
you'd be punished as well.

400
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Huang Hao Ran, you're the first to go.

401
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,230
-How many has it been?
-I think it's over 40.

402
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,050
Can he take it?

403
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,040
[She's a girl after all.]

404
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,760
[Can she take this?]

405
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,160
55.

406
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
Sang Tian, you can do it!

407
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,310
Coach Ma, Sang Tian was late because...

408
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,320
I'd adjusted his
alarm clock to a later time.

409
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,080
I'll take the punishment on his behalf.

410
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,930
Get up.

411
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,680
You guys seem united.

412
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,320
Okay. Both of you will take
the punishment together.

413
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,560
It'll be 300 goals.

414
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,360
Deducting the 70 goals from just now,

415
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,840
you have 230 more goals to defend.

416
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,480
How do you guys intend to split the work?

417
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,960
I'll take all of it.

418
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,400
Let's begin.

419
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,400
[145.]

420
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,550
[146.]

421
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,720
[147.]

422
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,520
Wen Bing.

423
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,280
Are you okay?

424
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,760
Wen Bing, are you okay?

425
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,280
Wen Bing has defended 250 goals.

426
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,240
Yes.

427
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,400
He's amazing.

428
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,880
It is very important for
a goalkeeper to stay focused.

429
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,580
Will his body be able to take it?

430
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,480
It's not over.

431
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,570
Continue.

432
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,719
Don't throw the game.

433
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,520
Huang Hao Ran.

434
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,320
Don't you have a huge strength?

435
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,320
Go for it. Don't be easy on them.

436
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,520
Wen Bing.

437
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,640
Are you alright?

438
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,920
Look out!

439
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,270
300.

440
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,880
They have finally defended 300 goals.

441
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,280
I'm not helping you out.

442
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,960
I was just afraid that
if you got kicked out of school...

443
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
you'd leak my secret out.

444
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,440
Sang Tian.

445
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,200
Sang Tian.

446
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,780
Sang Tian.

447
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,760
Sang Tian, are you all right?

448
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Sang Tian.

449
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,370
[Clinic]

450
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Tian Tian, you're awake.

451
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,400
I'll help you get up.

452
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,560
Tian Tian, why don't you quit school?

453
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
It is too dangerous for you.

454
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll go apply for withdrawal
on your behalf after this.

455
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,360
It's not that serious.

456
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,720
I was just too tired.
And on top of that...

457
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,960
Your coach is a devil.

458
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,640
How can she give such training?

459
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,800
Moreover, you're a girl.

460
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,820
Coach Ma doesn't know that I'm a girl.

461
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
[I don't care. What's going on?]

462
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,350
[Your coach is a devil and
your roommate is abnormal.]

463
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,950
[You're living in hell.]

464
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,880
[Actually, he isn't as bad as you said.]

465
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,800
[If he hadn't helped me today,]

466
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,600
[I would have fainted much earlier.]

467
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,840
[But Tian Tian...]

468
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,440
[Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.]

469
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,050
Moreover, I didn't attend
Liuye University...

470
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,400
to change my luck.

471
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,840
[I'm here because...]

472
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
this is my mother's alma mater.

473
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,280
My mother often told me about
Liuye University when I was little.

474
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,960
[I think all the grasses and trees
in this school...]

475
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,840
[must remember her too.]

476
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,200
So, whenever I'm on campus,

477
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,640
I feel that I'm a step closer
to my mother.

478
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,820
[Tian Tian, what about figure skating?]

479
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,270
[Just as you said.]

480
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,440
I'm on the same campus.

481
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,800
I'm in the same ice rink.

482
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,280
Maybe heaven is fulfilling my wish
in another way.

483
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,280
[Since I'm here,]

484
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,440
[I should continue to do my best.]

485
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,640
[What do you think?]

486
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,080
[All right, Tian Tian.]

487
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,810
[You have to promise me one thing.]

488
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,080
No matter what happens,
you have to take good care of yourself.

489
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,080
It doesn't matter if you have bad scores.

490
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,990
[Just don't get expelled.]

491
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,280
[Moreover, your dream
isn't related to ice hockey.]

492
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,120
Don't worry. I make my promise.

493
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,280
Don't worry.

494
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,440
You make me worry all the time.

495
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,760
Well...
Thanks for today.

496
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,800
You're welcome.

497
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,080
Since you've helped me today,

498
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,720
all that past between us
shall be forgotten.

499
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,320
I'm always true to my word.

500
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,590
I won't threaten you with this any more.

501
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,640
Are you sure you won't regret it?

502
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,560
I'm a man of my word.

503
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,560
I found a red notebook when
I was cleaning the room.

504
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,960
Is it yours?

505
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,000
What notebook?

506
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,680
[A hundred ways to conquer Wen Bing.]

507
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,640
"A hundred ways to conquer Wen Bing."

508
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,280
"Method one."

509
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,760
"Be deceitful and do it by force."

510
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,470
[Be deceitful and do it by force.]

511
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,640
"Method two."

512
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,240
"Slip on a banana peel."

513
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,670
[Slip on a banana peel.]

514
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,960
[Slip on a banana peel.]

515
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,860
"Method three."

516
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,760
[Waking you up while you're dead asleep.]

517
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,380
"Waking you up while you're dead asleep."

518
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,210
[Waking you up while you're dead asleep.]

519
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,400
What a powerful imagination.

520
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,730
These are so cheesy and ridiculous.

521
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,280
Don't tell me you came out with all these?

522
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,840
How would I know? I didn't draw it.

523
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,000
It certainly can't be me too.

524
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,200
I have no clue what's going on.

525
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,680
[Both of you are living
in the same room.]

526
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,520
[You can make use of
this chance to kiss him.]

527
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,080
[By the way, you've got
to memorise that little red book.]

528
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,560
I just recalled.

529
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,720
A friend of mine drew it.
