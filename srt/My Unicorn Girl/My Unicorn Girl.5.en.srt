Then, my sister's phone
went out of battery.

00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,480
She's unable to reach and
even lost consciousness.

8
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
She might be in danger
if no one discovered her!

Luckily, I am smart enough
to check the CCTV footage.

10
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,850
I locked onto my sister from one of all
those screens with my clear eyes...

and saved her on time.

Do you know how touched
my sister was when I saved her?

Didn't Wen Bing send you back
to the dormitory?

It should be fine since
it's not the first time.

Do you know how rare it is
to get an orange card?

The Figure Skating Department
was there yesterday.

132
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,120
Someone would hear you
if you cried for help.

Who's talking about the court?

149
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,640
I want to ask about that Coach Zhang.

150
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,440
Did you two meet up?

151
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,640
You should eat even if you
didn't go to the movies.

I've told you before.

I'm not in the mood

154

The present does not decide the future.

155
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,040
We have to prepare ahead of time.

156
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,450
I heard that the Figure Skating Department
didn't do well in previous competitions.

157

You even lost to Qianbei University
in the last friendly match.

158
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,360
I think it's better for you
to manage your students...

159
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,320
than to meddle in others' personal life.

You're so right, Senior!

161

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
is the Ice Hockey Department studying?

164
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,960
-I...
-But it may be to no avail.

165
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,440
The Figure Skating Department has been
topping the test scores every year.

166
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,360
But we can't make do, right?

167
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,000
The culture test is really important.

168
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,800
Give all your best this year!

169
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,240
For the upcoming culture test,

170
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,750
we have to win
the Figure Skating Department.

171
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,240
If you can't make it,

172
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,550
I'll make you all return to where
you came from and out of my sight!

173
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,160
We’re not going to practice today. Go self study.

174
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,640
She's having a bad temper.

175
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,600
What's wrong?

176
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Fell out of love?

177
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,640
What happened to Coach Ma?

178
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,930
Leave him be!

179
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,120
I told you! He doesn't know anything.

180
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,040
You can ask me about that in the future.

181
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,000
What's with that reply?

182
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,280
Ask me!

183
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,230
What happened to Coach Ma? Why...

184
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,990
The Figure Skating Department wins us
every year in the culture test.

185
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,599
Coach Xue and Coach Ma
are like cats and dogs.

186
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Coach Ma must've been openly
dissed by Coach Xue.

187
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,000
That's why she made that oath.

188
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,319
Seems like the Ice Hockey Department
has to fight for it.

189
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,200
Wait!

190
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,970
What does she mean to make us
return to where we came from?

191
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,400
She's expelling us.

192
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,760
Can't you understand?

193
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,960
She's really going for it?

194
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,720
Don't panic.

195
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,000
You'll pass the test
if you follow my steps.

196
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,040
You have a way?

197
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,160
Gather around! Hurry!

198
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,160
From what I heard, the Figure Skating
Department scores well...

199
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,360
because of a book of selected questions
that has been passed around.

200
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,550
Shut up!

201
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,840
It narrows down
the exam scope to the extreme.

202
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
If we can get the book and study it,

203
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,310
we can definitely win this fight, right?

204
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,280
Wen Bing, you're close to Meng Na.

205
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,930
You can sacrifice yourself
for the book, right?

206
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,920
Didn't you say that the book
is kept to their own?

207
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,680
Meng Na will be attacked
if she gives it to me.

208
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
You do know how to take care of a girl.

209
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,130
We'll be expelled if we can't win.

210
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,880
-Yes, Xiao Xiao is right.
-Yeah.

211
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
Sang Tian, please talk to Wen Bing.

212
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
This concerns all of us,

213
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,820
especially the fate of slackers' like us.

214
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,000
If we don't have the book,
we'll be expelled for sure.

215
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,400
Yes, you're right!

216
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,080
-We have to give our best!
-Yeah.

217
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,960
Wen Bing.

218
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,520
It's just a book.

219
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,200
Leave it to me.

220
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,870
Li Sha, aren't we best friends?

221
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,640
Yes, but Coach Xue said that...

222
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,880
I'll be dead if you leak the questions
to the Ice Hockey Department.

223
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay.

224
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,160
I can only disappoint
Wen Bing for you then.

225
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,120
That's my good girl. Be good.

226
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,400
-My tummy hurts!
-What happened, Na Na?

227
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,760
I have to go! Hurry and leave here!

228
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
Why should I leave since we're sisters?

229
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,960
Leave!

230
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Okay, I'll wait for you.

231
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,560
Na Na.

232
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,760
Let's grab some food later.

233
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,320
Okay, what do you want to eat?

234
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,240
Should we go for porridge or noodles?

235
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,460
Noodles will be fine.

236
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,960
Are you done?

237
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,160
Na Na, are you done?

238
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,640
Na Na?

239
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,480
Li Sha, though I cherish our friendship,

240
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,800
but I'll give my life over love.

241
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,320
Na Na, how could you lie to your best friend?

242
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,000
Li Sha, I believe that you'll forgive me.
Bye!

243
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
Thinking of running?

244
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,400
Li Sha, don't do this to me.

245
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,080
Gosh! How to finish
memorising such a thick book?

246
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,050
Read the points.

247
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,250
These are all points!

248
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,120
What are these?

249
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,200
Look, this is simple.

250
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,280
[Theories on Kinesiology.]

251
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,840
[What is this?]

252
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,840
[Is this science or medicine?]

253
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
[There're biology,]

254
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,160
[advanced mathematics, anatomy,
psychology and nutrition somewhere here.]

255
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,330
[Gosh! I'd rather play baseball and
sell bubble milk tea forever...]

256
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,470
[than to memorise all these in my head.]

257
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,960
Monitor! Why isn't Wen Bing back yet?

258
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,280
Did he run away?

259
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,230
I hope not.

260
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,750
Wen Bing must've gone on a date with
Meng Na with an excuse to take the book.

261
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
Am I right?

262
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,320
Why did he do that
under these circumstances?

263
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,200
Does he know what are priorities?

264
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,680
Please talk to him, Monitor.

265
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,440
Rush him, Monitor!

266
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,160
Listen, Monitor.

267
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,800
Wei Lian is right,
we have only one day left.

268
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,360
It's dire if we lose one minute to study!

269
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,080
Please, Monitor!

270
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,440
We'll be expelled!

271
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,920
Talk to him!

272
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,580
Please! Go!

273
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,080
Please rush him!

274
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
No. But...

275
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,200
No buts.

276
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,920
Go, Monitor!

277
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,400
I'll go then.

278
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,760
Go quickly, Monitor!

279
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,920
Go, Monitor! Go!

280
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,320
-Go, go, go!
-Good luck!

281
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,400
Hurry!

282
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,080
Stop!

283
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,750
Why did you keep staring at me?

284
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,600
Sorry, I merely passed by.

285
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,360
I stared longer because you're good at it.

286
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,040
You're practising the Quadruple Toeloop?

287
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,480
You know figure skating?

288
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,320
A little.

289
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,800
What did you want to say?

290
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,120
There were some skaters
who learnt the move.

291
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,720
But if you're merely
targeting at technical points,

292
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,000
you'll make more mistakes,
which is bad for your total score.

293
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,520
Why do you think I can't do it?

294
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,270
Because it doesn't relate to
power and technique.

295
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,640
What does it relate to then?

296
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,760
Posture.

297
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,840
The Quadruple Toeloop is a difficult
technique that was cracked recently.

298
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,560
A lot of people missed
the best time to practise it.

299
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,400
You have to get used to the posture
since young to perform it well.

300
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,640
Are you saying that I'm old?

301
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,680
No! I've observed you.

302
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,800
Your hand movements and postures
were extremely elegant and stretched.

303
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,280
You're better than me.

304
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,880
If there's an individual prize
for artistic points,

305
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,320
you'll be the absolute champion.

306
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,160
You're hinting that I'm bad at it.

307
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
I didn't mean it.

308
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,070
I meant to not force yourself.

309
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,120
What's your name?

310
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Hello, Senior Miao Miao.

311
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm Sang Tian, a freshman
from Ice Hockey Department.

312
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,960
You know me?

313
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Of course. You're the most
beautiful girl on campus...

314
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,120
as well as the goddess of
Senior Meng Qi too.

315
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
Nonsense! Who wants to be his goddess?

316
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,130
This is for you.

317
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,320
I heard the Ice Hockey Department
was looking for it.

318
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,120
I printed an extra for the freshmen.

319
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,120
See this as a first meeting gift.

320
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,320
Thank you, Senior Miao Miao!

321
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,040
By the way, Senior Miao Miao.
What if...

322
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,760
What if I share this to the others,

323
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,560
will you get angry?

324
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,840
Since I've given you the book,

325

Guys, why are you so sad?

330
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,320
Are you waiting for this?

331
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
-Sang Tian!
-Sang Tian!

332
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,600
You brought it back!

333
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,760
-Give it to me!
-Let's share it!

334
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,970
You'll all get your share!

335
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,090
-Give me a copy!
-Give me one! Give me one!

336

Go, go, go!

Goodness! What a complete conclusion!

338

Why didn't he be with you?

346
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,600
I don't know. I didn't see him.

347

The book is here.

348
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,240
He still goes on a date?

349
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,440
-He's so steady.
-What a difficult question!

350
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,290
Why isn't he anxious for tomorrow's test?

351
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,360
Goodness me.

if you have a girlfriend to revise
your studies with you every day,

354
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,720
you won't be anxious too.

355
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,790
I can help you one-by-one, Wei Lian.

356
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,000
I can revise myself.

357

Stop bickering!
Are you guys studying or not?

358
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,600
-Okay, classrooms are closing.
-Revision time!

359
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,560
Let's study at Sang Tian's room.

-Nice!

-Let's go!
-I'll grab my things.

Why my room?

364

That's not right.
You have great memorizing skills.

365
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,520
You can get top scores in exams.

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
Why do you need this?

367
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,760
Because I'm helpful.

368
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,480
Helpful?

369
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,440
Do you think I don't know
you're helping someone?

370
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,790

just because of her.

-I'm talkative?

372
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,640
If I'm not talkative,
how can you get this?

373
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,520
I'm telling you. I've lost my face
for the sake of you and someone.

Great artist, you're almost late
for your micro-economics class.

378

if you miss the attendance taking session.

379
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280

00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,400
My food allowance of this month
was being swindled.

488
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,400
So you were cheated by the agent.

489
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,440
No wonder you came back with your luggage.

490
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,440
I thought you said
you can't bear to leave me.

491
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,800
This is not the point.

492
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,400
Anyway, I can buy you a meal
but not an expensive one.

493
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,160
I'll eat what you like then.

494
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
Okay, that's a plenty.

495
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Hotpot, barbecue,
grilled fish, one pot rice,

496
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,680
Oden, fried chicken...

497
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,560
All right. I'll go with Oden.

498
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,600
Why?

499
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,440
Then, I want abalones and lobsters.

500
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,480
Deal with Oden!

501
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,840
Let's clean the ice rink first.

502
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,480
You'll forgive me if you eat?

503
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,990
Wait for me.

504
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,000
I heard that someone from the
Ice Hockey Department cheated in the exam.

505
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,440
Seems like the Figure Skating Department
will top the scores again!

506
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,020
We don't even know the average points yet.

507
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Why are you so anxious?

508
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,880
The result is quite obvious now,

509
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,880
since that two of your students
flunked the exam.

510

We didn't teach him well.

522
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,400
I'll give him a lesson when I go back.

523
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,360
It won't happen again.

It's normal for kids to be conceited
and has his own personality.

We can't put the blame all on the parents.

As teachers, we spend
more time with the children.

We should bear heavier
responsibilities instead.

Mr. Cheng, don't worry.
