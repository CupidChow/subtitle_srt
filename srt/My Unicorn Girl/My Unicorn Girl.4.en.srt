00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,080
It's done.

338
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,720
[Sang Tian, Sang Tian.]

339
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,080
[This is your once in a
lifetime opportunity.]

340
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,960
[Once you kiss him,]

341
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
[it will change your fate.]

342
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,080
Why did you move so close to me?

343
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,080
Are you still hitting on me?

344
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm not.

345
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,000
You dropped the bedsheet on the floor.

346
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,440
Wash it again.

347
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,550
Hey!

348
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,780
You rascal...

349
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,840
Why are you following me?

350
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
I'm going to eat too.
It's in the same direction.

351
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,850
Wen Bing!

352
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,620
Brother Wen Bing.

353
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,300
Bye-bye.

354
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,150
Don't think that I'll forgive
you just because of this.

355
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,640
Why are you eating like a hungry wolf?

356
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,910
I was trying to outwit
that pretentious faker.

357
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,310
My brainpower and stamina are drained.

358
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,960
Outwit him?

359
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,130
Just admit that you were knocked down...

360
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,960
and squashed on the floor by him.

361
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,480
It's all because of your little red book.

362
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,760
What a coincidence.

363
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,360
Hi, I'm Sang Tian's roommate.

364
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,600
Wen Bing.

365
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,790
Hi.

366
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm Sang Tian's best friend.

367
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,160
Now that you've greeted...

368
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
greeted each other.

369
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,280
Just eat your food.

370
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,680
I just happened to be starving.

371
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Sang Tian, eat some potato.

372
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,720
He doesn't eat potatoes.

373
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,260
Eat some carrot slices then.

374
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
He doesn't eat carrot slices.

375
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,720
Eat some dried bean curd then.

376
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,240
He doesn't know what a dried bean curd is.

377
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,440
-Lettuce.
-He doesn't eat this.

378
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,320
Stop.

379
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,050
I'll eat shrimps.

380
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,320
I can do it myself.

381
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,440
Enjoy your food.

382
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,360
I want to eat shrimp too.

383
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,310
Peel it for me.

384
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,280
What are you trying to do?

385
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,760
Do it.

386
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm not eating my food...

387
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,310
if you don't peel it for me.

388
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,370
Feed me.

389
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,750
Shrimp peeled by Sang Tian...

390
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,840
tastes so good.

391
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,270
I'm full.

392
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,910
Enjoy your shrimps.

393
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,240
Sang Zhan.

394
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,390
Who gave you the right
to call my name like that?

395
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,510
What was that about?

396
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,150
I was just testing him for you.

397
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,550
What are you testing him for?

398
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,270
He likes you.

399
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,760
Does he like me?

400
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,270
Yes.

401
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,600
How's that possible?

402
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,320
He bullied me for one whole day today.

403
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,600
He yelled at me in the dorm.

404
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,030
There's no way he likes me.

405
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,540
Looks like Xiao Rou forgot to tell you.

406
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,040
Rule number four of Rules of Love.

407
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,520
He bullies you because he likes you.

408
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,450
He bullies you because he likes you?

409
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,660
Is he a six years old boy?

410
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,540
That's right.

411
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,160
Men who are in love...

412
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,560
always behave like a child.

413
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,720
This can't be.

414
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,280
I must put a stop to this...

415
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,680
before it escalates.

416
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,030
Otherwise, imagine how awkward it would
be for us to live under the same roof.

417
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,510
You must be careful then.

418
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,680
Once a man's self-esteem is hurt,

419
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,430
he could become even frightening
than the eruption of the volcano.

420
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,310
Do you smell something nice?

421
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,430
Stop watching the game.

422
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,750
I bought you...

423
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,670
river shrimps,

424
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,150
white shrimps,

425
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,760
jinga shrimps,

426
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,960
mantis shrimps.

427
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,480
You didn't eat much just now.

428
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,910
Let me open it for you.

429
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,630
Okay, you can enjoy it now.

430
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,810
I don't want to eat.

431
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,440
Is it because peeling shrimp
is a hassle for you?

432
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,080
It's okay, I can peel it for you.

433
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,120
Let me tell you.

434
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,280
I'm the best when it
comes to shrimp peeling.

435
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,600
When I was in primary school, I
was the champion of shrimp peeling.

436
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,080
Which one would you like to eat?

437
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,000
Why don't we start with white shrimp?

438
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,560
I told you I don't want to eat.

439
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,840
You don't like this flavour?

440
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,840
How about we try another one?

441
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,840
Try this jinga shrimp.

442
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,630
Jinga shrimp is my
favourite of all time.

443
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,870
Its flesh is savory and fresh.

444
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,080
You'll crave more once you taste it.

445
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,870
Are you done?

446
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,150
Stop beating around the bush.

447
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,800
I just want to clear things up with you.

448
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,550
-My feelings for you...
-In your dreams.

449
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
I'm not interested in you.

450
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,390
You can't have me.

451
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,150
Psycho, idiot.

452
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,430
Pretentious faker, hypocrite.

453
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,720
Alien.

454
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,880
Idiot?

455
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,670
Jerk?

456
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,840
Moron?

457
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,160
[Wen Bing.]

458
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,120
Wen Bing?

459
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,230
Tian Tian.

460
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,960
Did Wen Bing piss you off again?

461
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,880
It was him who...

462
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,240
Yet he turned the table
around on me, he's a pig.

463
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,920
What exactly did he do?

464
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,760
I just don't want to see him anymore.

465
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,030
Is there any problem?

466
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,480
There is a big problem.

467
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,800
[If you keep talking to
a girl in this manner,]

468
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,480
[you're destined to be alone
for the rest of your life.]

469
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,560
I'm just worried about you.

470
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,560
[I'm worried that your relationship with
your roommate might break.]

471
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
[You just hurt her self-esteem...]

472
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,150
[for no reason.]

473
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,670
I'm afraid she won't talk to you anymore.

474
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,000
That's impossible.

475
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,910
Which classroom will...

476
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,270
theory class be held tomorrow?

477
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,920
[She's a girl.]

478
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,480
[It's normal for her to
have temper tantrums.]

479
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,680
[Just be the bigger person here.]

480
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,920
[Just soothe her feeling.]

481
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,510
[Don't bother with her.]

482
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,440
Here's your food.

483
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,480
Thank you.

484
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,030
[See this?]

485
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,120
[This is how a man with
bigger heart behaves.]

486
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,740
I didn't order this
especially for you,

487
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,710
I just wanted to make up the delivery fee.

488
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,480
[Why is she still upset?]

489
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,630
[Could it be...]

490
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,510
[because of the little red book?]

491
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,720
[Does she really need to give
me a silent treatment...]

492
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,880
[because of such a small matter?]

493
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,070
Here's your book.

494
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,390
It's no use to me anyway.

495
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,390
[What is she thinking?]

496
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,960
[Still not talking to me
after taking it back?]

497
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,910
[Girls are hard to read.]

498
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,920
Bastard.

499
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,510
One moment he's ordering me to do things,

500
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,990
the next he acts like nothing
happened and treats me well.

501
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,440
He's just unfathomable.

502
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,800
And he even said I want to have him.

503
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,720
Yuck!

504
