not realise next time.

Can these grapes be made into wine?

11
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,990
I'm not going to answer
such a stupid question.

12

You don't want to answer

but you still finished the game.

86
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,630
It's all because of me.

87
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,290
It's not because of you.

88
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,830
I'm doing it because of ice hockey.

89
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,630
Because of the competition.

90
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,230
Why do you want to win so much?

91
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,670
When I was younger and
learning ice hockey...

92
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,990
my mother promised me that...

93
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,390
if I get number one in the exam, she
would present me a new ice hockey stick.

94
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,070
Thus, I studied very hard.

95
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,030
At last, I received my first and
most valuable ice hockey stick.

96
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,390
Back then, I cleaned it every day...

97
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,470
and couldn't bear to use it.

98
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,150
But, after that...

99
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,660
something happened to my family.

100
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,510
I didn't play ice hockey
for a long period.

101
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,710
The ice hockey stick has been
laying in my house's cabinets.

102
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,630
But I told myself...

103
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,950
one day, I'll definitely bring
it back to the ice hockey rink.

104
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,070
A few years later, when I wanted
to start playing hockey again...

105
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,030
I found that the ice hockey
stick couldn't be used anymore.

106
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,910
What happened after that?

107
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,150
After that...

108
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,750
I understood a theory.

109
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,190
Whenever I encounter something
that I like to do,

110
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,030
I'll try my best to do it.

111
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,190
Because if I missed it...

112
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,590
I might not be able to do it again.

113
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,030
That's why, I do my best
in every competition...

114
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,670
until the very last second.

115
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,670
Actually, I'm envious of you.

116
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,270
I think I've never liked something
so much in my life before.

117
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,030
Then, why do you play ice hockey?

118
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,430
If I tell you, in the past,
I played it for money.

119
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,510
Will you believe me?

120
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,630
What about now?

121
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,390
I play it now because of my mum.

122
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,110
Liuye is my mum's alma mater.

123
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,110
That's why I want to stay in Liuye.

So, you don't really like ice hockey?

125
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,910
You could say so.

169
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,990
Don't make me pay later.

170
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,710
Yes, that's the deal.

171
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,780
That's for sure. Deal!

172
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,900
Excuse me.

173
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,990
Let's cook.

174
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,190
-Have a seat.
-We're back.

175
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,550
Why did you steal my drink?

176
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,510
So many grapes!

177
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,430
Give it to me.

178
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,390
Put it here.
Can I wear like this?

179
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,350
Want some?

180
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,310
Did both of you see Wei Lian
and Huang Hao Ran?

181
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,830
No. They're not back?

182
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,990
Enough. Too much.

183
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,150
We're back.

184
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,190
What happened?

185
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,510
What's wrong?

186
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,900
Wei Lian, what's wrong with you?

187
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,460
I accidentally poisoned him with a banana.

188
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,760
-Is he okay?
-It's my fault.

189
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,870
I didn't tell you guys Wei Lian
is allergic to banana and peanut.

190
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,910
[He really is my best partner.]

191
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,470
[He remembers my allergies.]

192
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,310
How do you feel now? Okay?

193
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,110
I'm okay.

194
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,500
Just a little hungry.

195
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,420
Hungry?

196
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
There's a lunchbox here.

197
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,950
He can't eat this.

198
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,590
This is the breakfast that
Sang Tian made for Wen Bing.

199
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,610
Breakfast that Sang Tian made
for Wen Bing?

200
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,580
I have something to do. I'll leave first.

201
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,540
Sandwich, sticky note, stupid.

202
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,670
[Wet garbage]

203
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,510
A message of love.

204
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,830
Are you two...

205
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,750
No. It's not like what you think.

206
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,350
Are you planning to hide
our secret forever?

207
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,700
What secret?

208
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,270
Don't talk nonsense.

209
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,830
Can you be a bit braver?

210
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,950
This isn't something to be ashamed about.

211
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,950
If you dare not tell it,
I'll tell it on your behalf.

212
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,390
Sang Tian is in a relationship!

213
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,390
Sang Tian has a girlfriend,

214
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,510
that's why he started
making homemade meals.

215
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,870
He made me his lab rat.

216
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,150
He is a shy person.

217
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,190
He is too shy to admit it that
he is no longer single.

218
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,350
It's such a happy thing.

219
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,750
You can't tell me alone.

220
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,470
You have to share it with everyone.

221
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,790
Yes.

222
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,670
Sang Tian, you really have
a girlfriend now?

223
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,000
Sang Tian, you're not a good friend.

224
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,950
You shouldn't learn from Huang Hao Ran.

225
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,550
Who is the girl? Do we know her?

226
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,590
Where did you meet her?

227
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,030
Right, Sang Tian. Who are you dating?

228
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,110
Tell us, please.

229
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,350
You've all met her.

230
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,910
She is...

231
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,580
Xiao Rou from Kiss Me Cafe.

232
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,070
You're really fast.

233
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,990
It's only a few days and you've
made her your girlfriend.

234
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,710
They are childhood friends.

235
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,510
They've been together for a few years.

236
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,710
Right, Sang Tian?

237
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,870
The meat skewers are done.

238
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,310
You talk too much.

239
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,870
The meat skewers are done!

240
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,710
What relationship? Who has a girlfriend?

241
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,590
Let's start the BBQ.
I'm going to cut vegetables.

242
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,270
Continue.

243
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,630
Let's eat meat.

244
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,670
-I have to make more. Everyone likes it.
-Okay.

245
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,350
Okay, we're at the school.

246
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,710
I need to go back first.

247
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,900
Keep it on.

248
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,750
You know people in the school.

249
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,030
Aren't you embarrassed
showing off your long johns?

250
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,780
I don't need it. I'm not cold.

251
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,190
I don't want it.

252
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,630
-Just wear it.
-Men and women shouldn't get too close.

253
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,630
Let's fix a time. We'll meet at
the school entrance tomorrow at 3pm.

254
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,140
I'll return the jacket to you.

255
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,869
This mad woman...

256
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,700
looks pretty cute when she's not mad.

257
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,190
I'm coming to help.

258
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,830
[This bunch of guys definitely
don't know anything.]

259
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,870
[As the only girl in our team,]

260
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,630
[it's time for me to show my real power.]

261
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,910
I'm done.

262
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,270
Your cutting skill is so good.

263
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,030
I even did a few mistakes.

264
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,830
I'll bring this out first.

265
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,830
What are you doing?

266
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,150
Peeling onions.

267
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,670
Do you know how to?

268
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,390
So stupid.
Do you want me to teach you?

269
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,350
No.

270
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,950
I'm experienced in peeling onions.

271
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,830
It's your loss that you
don't want me to teach.

272
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,910
You were still a baby when
I started peeling onions.

273
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,750
Watch carefully.
First, you have to peel the onion...

274
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,860
layer by layer.

275
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,950
You're too slow.

276
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,470
Peel like me. It's faster.

277
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,630
When I was in standard one...

278
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,910
I participated in onion peeling
competition and won it.

279
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,150
I almost had the chance to study overseas.

280
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,980
What are you guys doing?

281
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,140
-Peeling onions.
-Peeling onions.

282
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,700
What are these?

283
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,020
-The skin.
-The skin.

284
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,820
Get out.

285
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,860
Wei Lian, where are the rest?

286
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,750
They went home.

287
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,470
Let me help you.

288
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,540
Okay.

289
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,750
Be careful!

290
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,980
I'm fine.

291
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,100
Sang Tian, let me do it.

292
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,620
Wait for me in the room.

293
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,660
[In the room?]

294
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,420
[Go back to the room.]

295
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,110
[Oh dear. We're staying
in the same room.]

296
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,830
[What's more, on connecting beds.]

297
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,390
[It's worse than a twin room.]

298
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,580
We're here.

299
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,630
I'm going to open it.

300
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,470
Go in.

301
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,950
How come you're here?

302
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,620
Wen Bing.

303
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,310
We're all classmates.

304
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,190
The single room is full.
We'll have to squeeze.

305
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,910
[Sure, let's squeeze.]

306
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,220
[Three people are safer than two.]

307
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,640
Why? You don't want to?

308
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,870
It's not that.

309
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,190
Your hand is injured, right?

310
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,350
Staying alone is better.

311
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,150
I'll go and ask if there is
anything else available, like ours.

312
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,310
Wei Lian, it's okay.

313
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,430
This is supposed to be a triple room.

314
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,710
We can stay together.

315
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,880
Moreover, we can save more like this.

316
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,980
-Right?
-Okay, let's do this then.

317
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,700
I'll sleep in the middle
and you sleep here.

318
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,000
Why?

319
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,550
My right hand is injured.
You have to take care of me.

320
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,780
I'm here for a holiday.

321
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,670
I'm not here to be a nanny.

322
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,340
You're not here for a holiday.

323
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,230
You're here for training.

324
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,430
Why are you standing there?

325
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,470
Shower and sleep.

326
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,750
What are you looking at?
Turn off the lights.

327
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,710
I'll turn it off in a while.

328
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,170
[Why did he turn?]

329
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,700
[I hope he's not trying to get near me.]

330
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,710
It is a 20-minute walk.

331
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,230
Might as well play as I walk.

332
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,870
Saves me the taxi fee.

333
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,030
And, it's exercise.

334
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,270
Miss, do you need help?

335
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,780
You!

336
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,300
You seem fine. I'll leave first.

337
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,430
What's wrong?

338
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,710
A flat tire?

339
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,990
You already know and still ask.

340
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,030
Do you need help?

341
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,340
I don't need your help.

342
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,980
Okay, please wait a while.

343
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,750
Come.

344
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,070
I'll help you. Hold this.

345
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,140
It's okay.

346
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,660
Just hold it.

347
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,270
You can reject my present.

348
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,350
But, I'm still going to offer help.

349
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,310
Why don't you...

350
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,150
go rest at the side?

351
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,550
It's too dirty here.

352
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,430
If your clothes get dirty,

353
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,660
it'd be hard to wash.

354
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,540
It's okay. I'll just stand here.

355
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,260
-Be careful.
-I'm done.

356
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,020
I'll put these things away.

357
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,070
It's done. It's fixed.

358
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,750
Thank you.

359
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,910
-Over here.
-Is there more?

360
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,560
How about I add you on WeChat?

361
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,220
You can look for me
if something like this happens again.

362
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,320
[New notification. Your friend request

363
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,990
Your profile picture is quite hot.

364
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,170
Nothing

365
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,910
Thank you.

366
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm leaving.

367
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,740
Okay, sure.

368
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,240
Drive carefully.

369
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,270
Go slow. Your double signal is still on.
Off it.

370
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,910
Seat belt.

371
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,690
I know.

372
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,270
This is a spare tire.

373
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,070
You should drive slowly on the road.

374
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,340
Go slow!

375
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,940
What are you guys doing?

376
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,580
I didn't see anything.

377
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,850
[Wait a minute.]

378
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,850
[Why am I in this spot?]

379
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,050
[If he is on my right side...]

380
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,050
[Then the left side is...]

381
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,640
[It's great that everyone could
take part in this training.]

382
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,890
How nice would it be if I could play
ice hockey with best buddies forever.]

383
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,360
You didn't sleep well last night?

384
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,700
Did you dream the whole night?

385
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,700
I experienced sleep paralysis.

386
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,820
How could I sleep well?

387
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,820
My face hurts.

388
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,990
I'll have a look.

389
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,980
-Where are my slippers?
-What's up with you?

390
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,700
Who knows what you did last night?

391
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,220
You were probably sleepwalking.

392
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,140
He was sleepwalking? I had no idea.

393
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Did you see him?

394
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,740
You slept like a pig.

395
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,500
Of course you didn't see anything.

396
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,230
You are more like a pig!

397
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,140
No.

398
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,380
You are a rooster! Rooster head!

399
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,340
I get woken up by
my handsomeness every day.

400
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,740
What a bother.

401
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,390
[You talk like you know how you look.]

402
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,830
It's Coach Ma.

403
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,580
Hello, Coach Ma.

404
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,380
[I want all of you back
at school immediately!]

405
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,700
Oh dear.

406
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,660
I've emphasised many times...

407
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,140
not to bring Wen Bing out.

408
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,780
Who will be responsible if
anything happened to him?

409
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,180
You guys are not taking my
words seriously, are you?

410
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,540
Coach, it's all my fault.

411
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,060
I'm the organiser of this trip.

412
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,140
Coach Ma, it was my decision.

413
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,420
It wasn't Wei Lian.

414
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,030
Why won't you guys just tell the truth?

415
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,110
Shut up.

416
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,470
Coach Ma, they did remember your words.

417
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,710
They didn't bring me along.

418
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,590
They said nothing about it to me.

419
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,710
I found out myself and tagged along.

420
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,400
You three are quite united.

421
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,940
Still laughing?

422
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,740
If it's really habitual dislocation,

423
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,210
that would be the end
of your sporting career.

424
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,830
Coach Ma, I was wrong.

425
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,140
I'll be careful in the future.

426
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,030
Alright then.

427
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,950
Rest well these few days.

428
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,260
You will not take part in the competition
with Qianbei University.

429
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,950
Qianbei University?

430
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,420
Why? Feeling scared?

431
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
Why should we be scared?

432
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,460
Even if Qianbei was the champion
of the high school league last year,

433
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,990
our school team is not bad too.

434
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,940
The year before last
and three years before that,

435
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,340
we were the champions.

436
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,510
When did I say our school team
will compete with them?

437
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,390
If it's not the school team, who then?

438
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,550
Coach Ma.

439
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,430
You can't be thinking...

440
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,590
Yes, you guys, the freshmen team,
will compete with them.

441
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,220
Us?

442
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,150
I think the disparity of
strength is too great.

443
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,710
How are we supposed to compete?

444
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,110
You guys have to work hard.

445
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,350
Don't let me down.

446
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,350
This...

447
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,030
What is this?

448
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,330
Although the competition with Qianbei
is a rare opportunity,

449
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,380
but our disparity of
strength is too great.

450
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,560
Asking us to fight against the
champion of high school league...

451
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,510
Isn't that a bit impossible?

452
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,620
It's just Qianbei.

453
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,220
Do you have to be so scared?

454
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,310
The most important thing in a
competition is the spirit.

455
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,260
Everyone is already scared
before the match.

456
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,190
You don't have to be there of
course you can talk easily.

457
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,890
Vice monitor.

458
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,889
What?

459
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,100
You're wasting time.

460
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,420
Gather everyone for practice.

461
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,739
Nobody asked for your comment!

462
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,630
Let's go.

463
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,620
-Hi, coach.
-Hi, coach.

464
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,840
Coach!

465
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,659
Coach, why are you only letting
the freshmen?

466
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,710
We have been preparing for this
competition for very long.

467
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,230
You've seen it.

468
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,900
I believe we can win this time.

469
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,260
You want your revenge?

470
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,060
If that's what you think,

471
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,670
that's more reason
not to let you guys play.

472
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,020
I don't mean that.

473
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,659
But you know Shen Qiao Di from
Qianbei is very strong, right?

474
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,219
The freshmen can't handle him.

475
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,350
Only Wen Bing can.

476
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,949
But, Wen Bing is currently injured.

477
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,350
It's impossible for us to win
if you send these freshmen.

478
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,870
Not that it's impossible to win.

479
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,020
We're just bound to lose.

480
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,040
The freshmen of Liuye
are like wild horses.

481
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,190
They have huge egos too.

482
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,020
Better to throw them in the deep end
so they realise their shortcomings.

483
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,220
Is that a bad thing?

484
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,580
But, this concerns the reputations
of both...

485
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,750
I've already decided.

486
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,180
No room for discussion.

487
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
Coach Ma!

488
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,630
Give me another 7-up.

489
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,310
OK, please wait.

490
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,410
Brother

491
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,700
I got you your favourite
black pepper steak.

492
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,550
You still remember that
you have a brother?

493
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,740
Since school started,
you've never once looked for me.

494
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
I'm here with you for a meal now, right?

495
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,400
Come, let's eat the steak.

496
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,520
Don't eat that.

497
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,380
Why? You're not angry anymore?

498
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,070
Didn't you say that...

499
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,430
you were very disappointed with me?

500
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,270
Don't be so petty.

501
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,510
I said it out of anger.

502
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,020
I got the facts straight.

503
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,820
It was all Yan Wu Xu's doing.

504
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,990
You've been a scapegoat for him.

505
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,190
Where can I find such a kind-hearted
brother like you?

506
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,070
Right?

507
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,990
Cheers!

508
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,620
Are you planning to ask a favour from me?

509
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,790
Nothing can hide from my
brother's sharp eyes.

510
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,700
Okay, tell me.

511
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,440
I heard that you guys are going to
have a match with Qianbei.

512
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,120
You're starting, aren't you?

513
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,820
I'll not participate in this game.

514
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,700
Why not?

515
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,500
You're the ace.
How can they win without you?

516
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,590
Your coach can't be asking
the freshmen to play, right?

517
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,260
How could that happen?

518
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,830
Go and beg your coach.

519
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,340
This is an important competition.
It's about the reputation of Liuye.

520
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,250
How can she ask the freshmen to play?

521
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,370
She should ask the seniors to play.

522
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,290
I did ask her. It's useless.

523
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,680
The freshmen will be playing this time.

524
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,440
No, I don't care.

525
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,940
Wen Bing is injured.

526
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,060
You should play the game.
He can't play it.

527
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,130
Na Na...

528
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,300
I thought you came to see me
because you care about me.

529
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,180
Turns out you're here because of Wen Bing.

530
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,380
It's your people who hurt Wen Bing.

531
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,620
So you guys should play. Is that so hard?

532
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,940
Okay, sure. Don't worry.

533
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,900
He doesn't have to play this time.

534
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,700
He is still injured.

535
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,060
Coach forbids him to take part.

536
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,990
Really?

537
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,630
That's good.

538
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,590
Meng Qi, next time you wish to have steak,
tell me.

539
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,670
I'll buy for you.

540
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,060
Drink more yoghurt.

541
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm off. See you.

542
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,980
How's Wen Bing now?

543
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,260
Should I go visit him?

544
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,150
No.

545
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,820
Kidney Hurt said that...

546
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,490
I shouldn't be clingy
to avoid any trouble.

547
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,940
Besides, he can't play in the match.

548
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,780
He must be feeling down.

549
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,660
I have to be a lovable cutie.

550
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,630
Right?

551
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,100
I can't disturb him all the time.

552
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,780
[Let's play.]

553
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,940
[No, I need to go out later.
I have an appointment at 3pm.]

554
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,070
[Is it your dream guy?]

555
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,740
[No. It's someone I hated in the past.]

556
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,270
[What about now?]

557
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,220
[Now... I guess I don't hate him anymore.]

558
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,820
[Sometimes, he's like a maniac.]

559
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,460
[But other times, he's a gentleman.]

560
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,910
[I don't know how to describe it.]

561
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,950
[He's just a weird guy.]

562
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,790
[A gentle maniac?]

563
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,990
[That is quite weird.]

564
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,510
[Yes, he is usually rude.]

565
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,750
[But yesterday,]

566
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,870
[I was on the way to meet my dream guy
when I accidentally tore my dress.]

567
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
[He actually lent me his own jacket.]

568
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,400
[I hope he didn't fall ill.]

569
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,300
She's...

570
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,760
She is the mad woman.

571
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,710
[So her dream guy is...]

572
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,660
She...

573
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,310
She really is the mad woman!

574
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,230
Oh my goodness.

575
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,630
Am I helping others to seduce
my sister's boyfriend?

576
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,500
[Okay, I need to go now.]

577
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,460
[I need to return the jacket to him
at 3pm.]

578
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,840
[I'm leaving. Bye.]

579
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,580
Xiao Rou.

580
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,020
I picked these myself.
They're organic.

581
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,470
Thanks, Tian Tian.

582
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,790
Thank you is not enough.

583
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,350
What else do you want me to do?

584
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,700
Be your girlfriend?

585
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,860
You guessed it.

586
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,020
Seriously?

587
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,210
Now everyone thinks you're my girlfriend.

588
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,990
Why?

589
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,230
It's all because of him.

590
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,340
Wen Bing?

591
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,550
If not, who else?

592
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,630
Xiao Rou, you have to help me.

593
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,510
You must always remember your role now.

594
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,270
You are my girlfriend.

595
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,970
Is it so serious, Tian Tian?

596
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,260
Of course.

597
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,700
Your milk tea shop is located at a place
where people from Liuye always go.

598
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,420
The secret would be easily exposed.

599
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,170
That makes sense.

600
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,730
I guess I'm now Sang Tian's girlfriend.

601
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,150
My baby...

602
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,710
What do you want to eat tonight?

603
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,670
Stop.

604
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,360
Remember your role.

605
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,280
-Girlfriend.
-Girlfriend.
