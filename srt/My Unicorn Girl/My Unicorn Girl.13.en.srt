Hi, are you here to
return the down jacket?

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
How do you know?

6
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,320
The person you're waiting for has left.

7
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,240
He asked me to inform
you to wait here for a while.

8
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,920
He will be back once he is free.

She didn't lose anything, right?

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,920
Why is he not here yet?

18
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,840
Didn't he confirm to be here at 3 p.m.?

19

Being kind to your enemy...

27
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,760
means being heartless to your sister.

Tomorrow is the friendly
match, yet you went out...

strategy at the dorm?

But my girlfriend...

32
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,110
is too clingy, she insisted on
having a candle light dinner with me.

33
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,640
Then why did you come back?

34
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm done eating, shouldn't I be back?

35

together for so long,

is not going forward.

You're not good at ice
hockey and learning.

Shen Qiao Di,
a defender as well as the captain.

88
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,040
His strength is, he has no weakness.

89
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,520
He's good on both defense and offense,

90
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
and he was awarded as the MVP in the High
School League for three consecutive years.

91
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,600
He's known as Qiao Di, the Copper Wall.

92
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,320

I wonder what Coach Ma is thinking.

96
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,640
Isn't she sending us
out there to be defeated?

97
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,520
I also heard that in last year's league,

98

Senior Meng Qi formed a
team to defeat Shen Qiao Di,

99

Don't you know that walls have ears?

101

You're talking nonsense again.

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,640
What's wrong with scoring two goals?

107
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
Can you rookies even score?

-What if you didn't score a goal?

110

What of it?

117
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,040
My name sounds the same
when read backwards anyway.

Alright. We will lose anyhow.

119

Alright. Although our
squad leader can't play,

128
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,920
we can't lose our morale.

129
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,320
Why don't we set a small goal?

130

Earning 100 million?

131
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,280
Can you think rationally?

132
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,520
Let's target to score a goal.

133
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,520
Score a goal?

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,040
Wei Lian, what are you
thinking about? Come.

135
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,600
Score a goal.

136
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,080
Good luck.

137
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,440
Alright, let's go for training.

-Let's go.
-Let's go.

139
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,240
How was the training today?

140
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,240
Nothing special.

141
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,520
Anyhow, we're not expecting to win.

142
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,680
But Wei Lian seems weird to me lately.

143
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,480
In the past, when there
was a gathering or a match,

144
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,060
he would be the most energetic one.

145
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,450
But today, he didn't talk much.

146
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,600
So, you'll be training for
the whole day tomorrow.

147
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,760
You won't be in the dorm, right?

148
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,920
Could it be that he broke up with someone?

149
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,880
Why do you keep
mentioning Wei Lian to me?

150
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,520
Can't you be more concerned about me?

151
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,400
Squad leader, how was your
day in the dorm today?

152
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,360
-Forget it.
-Alright.

153
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,680
Why are you angry with me?

154
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,240
I'm officially inviting you
to our match tomorrow.

155
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,480
-I'm going to sleep.
-After all, you'll be bored at dorm.

156
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm serious.

157
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
You see,
it's true that you hurt your hand,

158
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,970
but, you're the squad leader.

159
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,560
You can come and give us some guidance,

160
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,350
providing us support on technique matter.

161
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,600
It shouldn't be a problem, right?

162
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
Take it away and go to bed.

163
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
Squad leader.

164
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,680
Take it away and go to bed.

165
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,360
You...

166
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,400
Fine, don't guide us.

167
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
We'll train ourselves.

168
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
How did you move it here?

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,480
What's wrong with Wei Lian today?
Why is he so early?

170
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,240
I think he broke up with his girlfriend.

171
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,800
Broke up with whom?

172
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
With you.

173
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,560
Deputy monitor, what's
wrong with Wei Lian today?

174
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,360
I don't know.

175
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,320
[Qianbei Ice Hockey
Team Tactical Skills Manual]

176
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,080
Xiao Xiao,

177
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,520
where did you get this information from?

178
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,760
There's even the position map of Qianbei?

179
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,520
I was looking through Wen Bing's
Baidu Tieba for two days...

180
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,640
and found out a few fans
from Qianbei Primary School.

181
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,440
One of them even specially requested to be
our spy and prepared this manual for us.

182
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,680
Really?

183
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,880
Yes.

184
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,320
I have an idea.

185
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,440
Shen Qiao Di has a
nickname of Copper Wall right?

186
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,240
Why don't we build a "demolition team"?

187
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,680
What do you mean?

188
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,640
What does demolition need?

189
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,880
Excavators.

190
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,600
Think about it.

191
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,480
Who looks the most like
an excavator among us?

192
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
Having long arms, heavy,

193
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,200
with explosive power, tough.

194
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,240
Why are you all looking at me?

195
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,550
Don't be shy.

196
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,400
You are our secret weapon.

197
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,400
But...

198
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,280
we cannot underestimate Shen Qiao Di.

199
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,120
One excavator is not enough,
we need at least two.

200
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,920
Wei Lian.

201
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
Shen Wei Lian, what are you doing?

202
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
Don't tell me you're afraid.

203
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,120
Who says I'm scared of him?

204
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,360
I will say it clearly today,

205
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,360
I will slam Shen Qiao Di
until he surrenders.

206
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
Alright, let's call it a deal.

207
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,630
Li He, Wei Lian, both of you...

208
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
are in charge of keeping an eye on
Shen Qiao Di and defeat him.

209
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,840
Li He, do you have any problem?

210
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,160
-No problem.
-Wei Lian, how about you?

211
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,680
I...

212
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,430
I have no problem either.

213
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,360
I have something to do, I'll get going.

214
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,160
Sang Tian, what happened
to Wei Lian recently?

215
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,080
Why does he look absent-minded?

216
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,080
He's right.

217
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,560
What's wrong with him these two days?

218
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,200
He's acting weird during training.

219
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,320
-What's wrong with him?
-Yes.

220
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,760
He comes earlier for morning training
and leaves later for night training.

221
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,400
Why is he training so hard?

222
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,040
He's indeed not like himself.

223
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,600
[Aren't you Shen Qiao Di's
little brother?]

224
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,400
[You're tired already after a few rounds?]

225
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,600
[You're a freshman too.]

226
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,520
[Why are you so useless
while you brother is great?]

227
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,520
[Why are you so useless?]

228
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,680
[You don't deserve to
be called my brother.]

229
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,720
When we were little kids,

230
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,480
we usually played in the field.

231
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,240
You were younger than us,

232
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,680
so, when you chased us,
you were always left behind.

233
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,080
And you would cry.

234
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Really? Why don't I remember?

235
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,680
That's great, I was worried
that you'd never forget about it.

236
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,440
-No.
-No?

237
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,000
Why are you so nervous then? Are
you worried that you will lose tomorrow?

238
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,520
Even you think that I will lose?

239
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,600
You have been losing for over ten years.

240
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,120
Why are you scared?

241
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
You should've gotten used to it.

242
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,720
I have training in the evening.
I'm leaving.

243
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,040
Wei Lian, it doesn't matter
if you lost to your brother,

244
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,670
but if you lost to yourself,
people will look down on you.

245
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,840
[You don't deserve to
be called my brother.]

246
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,840
[it doesn't matter
if you lost to your brother,]

247
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,600
[but if you lose to yourself,
people will look down on you.]

248
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,960
[She's right, even if I lose,]

249
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,360
[I have to show the courage to lose.]

250
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,600
[If I don't even dare to play,]

251
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,040
[then I'll have to
admit that I'm useless.]

252
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,240
Why is Wei Lian not here yet?

253
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,080
That's right, it's almost time, why
is he not here yet?

254
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,400
He is here.

255
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,400
Wei Lian, come here quickly.

256
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm here.

257
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,160
Don't forget about our goal.

258
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,840
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

[But of course,]

268
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,000
[the freshmen are facing a strong opponent
like Shen Qiao Di as the game begins.]

269

[Who wouldn't be nervous?]

270
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
[Moreover, Captain Wen Bing
won't be playing today.]

[How would Liuye Team play the game?]

272

You're Wen Bing, right?

You know me?

275

Sang Tian and Wei Lian
mentioned about you before.

276

Do you think they can win?

277
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,840
I'm not there. It's unlikely.

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,990
[He raises his stick.
Is he going to shoot?]

323
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,800
[What happened?]

324
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,000
[He stops unexpectedly.]

325
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,360
[Shen Wei Lian missed the last chance
and got hit by Shen Qiao Di again.]

326
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,960
[Looks like the great disparity in
strength has been exposed in the game.]

327
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,880
[Shen Wei Lian is not decisive
and less spirited.]

328
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,560
Wei Lian is frightened. Looks like he's
stressed out because of his brother.

329
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,840
How do you know they are brothers?

330
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,080
[Time is counting down for the match.]

331
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,800
[Shen Qiao Di got hold of the puck again.]

332
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
-[He shoots decisively. Goal again.]
-Nice.

333
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,760
[Qianbei scored one point again.]

334
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,280
Wei Lian is an athlete with good
qualities. However,

335
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,840
his brother is a genius.

336
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,960
The brother is like a
shadow shrouded over him.

337
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,720
He's always smiling,
but when it comes to his brother,

338
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,760
he will change into another person.
I wonder...

339
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,800
when will he open up his heart.

340
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,040
Besides himself, no one
can help him in this.

341
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,240
[This is really a clear victory.]

342
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
[Liuye has no way to fight back.]

343
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,920
[Today's match is also
considered a lesson for Liuye.]

344
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,800
[Looking forward for a more surprising
performances from the freshmen.]

345
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
[The match ends here.]

346
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,920
Nice.

347
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,360
Shen Wei Lian,
why didn't you shoot the puck?

348
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,120
It was a good chance.
Why were you stunned?

349
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,280
Alright.

350
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
Why? We're not allowed
to talk about why we lost?

351
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,280
I'm just summarizing. Our team member
shouldn't be the cause to lose.

352
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,920
You could've scored.

353
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,840
Xiao Xiao, stop talking.

354
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,960
Let it go.
Wei Lian didn't do it on purpose.

355
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,320
Fine.

356
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,960
Every one of you is nice,

357
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
and I'm the harsh one.

358
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,280
Why are you all sitting here?
Let's go home.

359
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,160
Are you waiting for Yan Wu Xu to
come and laugh at us?

360
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,920
Wha... What are you doing?

361
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,440
Shen Qiao Di is my brother.

362
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
In my whole life,

363
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,160
I have never defeated him.

364
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,880
Shen Qiao Di is his brother?

365
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,800
-Wen Bing.
-Here.

366
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,200
-Sang Tian.
-Here.

367
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,840
-Xiao Xiao.
-Here.

368
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,120
-Huang Hao Ran.
-Here.

369
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,120
-Li He.
-Here.

370
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,240
Shen Wei Lian.

371
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,120
-He is not here?
-I didn't see him.

372
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,480
Where is he?

373
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,360
Wei Lian is on sick leave.

374
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
-Sang Tian.
-Sang Tian.

375
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,560
Wei Lian.

376
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,640
Wei Lian, are you in the room?

377
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,600
Why didn't Shen Wei Lian
come for training?

378
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,240
My words that day were a bit harsh,
but he doesn't need to be so dispirited.

379
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,080
Who would've known that
Shen Qiao Di is his brother?

380
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,950
Apologize.

381
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,680
What? You want me to apologize?

382
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,000
No way.

383
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,960
Fine. I will go.

384
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,360
It's useless.

385
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,800
I already went to the dorm and
looked for him a few times.

386
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,800
He is shutting himself away.

387
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,070
What should we do? If he
keeps skipping classes and training,

388
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
Coach Ma...

389
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,440
-Hi, coach.
-Hi, coach.

390
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,960
-Coach Ma.
-Where is Shen Wei Lian?

391
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,960
He is on sick leave.

392
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,760
Again?

393
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,200
What's wrong with Shen Wei Lian?

394
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,720
This is not the first or second time.

395
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,720
Even the subject teachers are complaining.

396
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,000
You inform him that...

397
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,040
if he's still absent in the next lesson,
ask him to get lost immediately.

398
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,080
Liuye doesn't welcome
undisciplined and disorganized students.

399
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,060
Inform the others to
gather in the field at 1 p.m..

400
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,040
Do you think Coach Ma will expell him?

401
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,080
Deputy monitor,
why don't you try and talk to him.

402
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,320
Talk to him.

403
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,200
Yes, please talk to him.

404
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,400
Me?

405
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,080
Wei Lian, what are you doing?

406
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,960
Spying on Miao Miao?

407
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,280
What's this?

408
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,840
Let me tell you a story.

409
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,280
Look, this is a chopstick.

410
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,520
A chopstick can break easily.

411
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,080
Look carefully.

412
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
[No, this can't fail.]

413
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,280
Easy, isn't it?

414
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,600
But it'll be different if
there's a bunch of chopstick.

415
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,720
Look.

416
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,200
They're unbreakable.

417
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,480
What does this mean?

418
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,080
This means the power
of one person is limited.

419
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,680
But if it's a team, the
power is unlimited.

420
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,840
As the saying goes,

421
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,320
"two heads are better than one."

422
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,520
In our class, there are 12 hea...

423
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,590
Hea...

424
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,880
Twelve thinking heads.
What are you afraid of?

425
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,520
You still don't believe me?

426
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,880
Then, try it yourself.

427
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,360
Try it. Come on.

428
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,960
Let me tell you.

429
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
With more people, we will...

430
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,200
The quality of the chopsticks is bad.

431
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,680
Do you have anything else?

432
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,600
Coach Ma asked me to inform you,

433
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,840
if you skip classes again...

434
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,800
She will expell me????

435
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,880
Let her expell me then.

436
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,000
Wei Lian.

437
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,040
I wanted to use the story,

438
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,520
so, I took out a bunch of chopstick.

439
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,960
Then I bent them.

440
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,640
Actually, I just wanted to
demonstrate it to him,

441
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,560
but when the chopsticks were bent,
they broke.

442
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,520
And I couldn't talk Wei Lian out of it.

443
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,200
Then, he walked away.

444
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,160
What should we do now?

445
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,680
Were you there to make fun?

446
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,440
Wei Lian is already like this,
how could you still laugh?

447
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,990
He doesn't even bother.

448
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,520
Why are you being such a busybody?

449
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,280
How can you say that?

450
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,000
Maybe Wei Lian was talking out of pique.

451
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,120
If we don't care about him,

452
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,000
and he got expelled,

453
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,960
he'll definitely feel regret in future.

454
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,400
He hasn't lost his senses.

455
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,280
He is frustrated with himself.

456
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,680
Moreover,
it's pointless presuring him everyday.

457
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,580
Because you can't wake a person
who is pretending to sleep.

458
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,960
You only know how to
say discouraging words.

459
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,360
Did you show him your concern?

460
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,200
Did you ever care about this match?

461
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,910
I invited you to guide everyone,
but you didn't even show up.

462
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,240
You think you're so superior?

463
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,920
-What do you mean?
-What is the purpose of guiding?

464
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,360
We will lose, anyway.

465
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,640
I'm sleepy, goodbye.

466
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,840
You...

467
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,719
I finally know his true colors.

468
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,969
He is nothing but a hypocrite.

469
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,760
He is always smiling, but in
actual, he's just a selfish guy.

470
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,400
You...

471
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,960
Are you listening to me?

472
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,120
Tian Tian, I actually feel that it's
not as serious as what you said.

473
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,159
Both of you now are like
Shen Wei Lian's parents.

474
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,760
One of you wants to
let him do things freely,

475
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,480
while another wants to
watch him all the time.

476
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,880
Actually when I think of it,

477
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,080
both of you are not wrong.

478
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,600
You don't have to take it so seriously.

479
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,520
Fang Xiao Rou, what happened to you?

480
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,120
Why are you siding him but not me?

481
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,159
Tian Tian,

482
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,880
I didn't mean that.

483
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,080
You think about it.

484
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,060
Shen Wei Lian has always
been afraid of his brother.

485
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,360
This has to be settled slowly.

486
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,800
Be patient.

487
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,880
This way, please.

488
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,560
How can I be patient?

489
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,920
If he keeps this up,

490
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,040
he will be expelled from Liuye.

491
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,360
How can I not be worried?

492
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,120
But it's useless even if you're worried.

493
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,920
Think about it, if you rush him...

494
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,560
you'll not be able to help him.

495
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,080
Right?

496
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,560
You're right.

497
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,260
How many years was it since
you invited me for a meal?

498
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,720
What is it about?

499
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,040
I want to talk about Wei Lian with you.

500
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,640
Let's not have this meal then.

501
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,200
You're his brother.

502
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,880
Why can't you give him some encouragement?

503
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,680
Didn't you notice his progress
and hard work after all these years?

504
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,240
Brother?
He doesn't deserve to be called that.

505
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,240
The Shen family doesn't need him too.

506
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,240
Bye.

507
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,400
-Tian Tian.
-How can you say that about Wei Lian?

508
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,240
Sang Tian.

509
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,080
Winning or losing aren't the
most important thing.

510
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,720
If a winner like you don't even
know how to respect people,

511
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
so what if you have won?

512
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,320
Do you dare to bet?

513
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,680
If I win in a one on one match with you,

514
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,900
you have to apologize to Wei Lian.

515
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,120
One on one? Are you sure?

516
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,560
No one ever defeats me one on one.

517
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,840
That may not last forever.

518
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,280
Tomorrow at 3 p.m., I will wait
for you at the ice rink.

519
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,720
-I'm taking my leave, Miao Miao.
-I'm leaving too.

520
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Tian Tian, that's cool.

521
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,680
You told me that Shen Qiao Di...

522
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,400
is the MVP for Collegiate League
for three consecutive years, right?

523
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,480
Tian Tian, you were really cool just now.

524
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,880
What happened, Tian Tian?

525
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,640
-What did I say just now?
-You were so cool.

526
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,880
You said you want a one on
one match with Shen Qiao Di.

527
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,480
Why didn't you stop me?

528
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,720
I'm done.

529
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,320
What should I do tomorrow?

530
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Tian Tian, you were the one
who challenged Shen Qiao Di.

531
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,920
It's okay, we can just not show up.

532
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,280
-Right?
-No.

533
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,120
I can't break my promise when I
was the one who challenged him.

534
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,720
Bring it on.

535
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,080
Tian Tian!

536
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,920
Have you eaten?

537
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,040
There are a lot of snacks here.

538
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,160
Do you want some?

539
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,080
You look hungry.

540
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,160
I'm not hungry.

541
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,400
You didn't apply medicine to your hand.

542
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,510
Let me help you.

543
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,400
No need.

544
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,720
You are on the bed all day long,

545
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,350
surely your hair makes you uncomfortable.

546
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,400
Do you want me to help you to wash it?

547
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,040
What do you want from me?

548
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,320
Just tell me.

549
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,080
Nothing.

550
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,870
Didn't you say that...

551
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,880
I didn't care enough for you?

552
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
If there's nothing,

553
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm going to sleep.

554
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
Wait.

555
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,560
Actually, I need to ask you something.

556
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,480
A domineering player like Shen Qiao Di...

557
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,600
Does he have any weakness?

558
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Don't tell me you challenged him.

559
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,360
That's impossible.

560
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,760
I wouldn't overestimate myself.

561
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,480
We're having a competition soon.

562
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,640
I, as the deputy monitor,

563
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,560
need to make a summary.

564
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,200
Maybe we can discuss it?

565
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,880
Instead of wasting time thinking
about other's weaknesses...

566
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,400
you should think about your own strength.

567
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,320
Forget it.
You don't seem to have any strength.

568
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,360
You...

569
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,600
Wasted my time asking.

570
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,600
Take it away.

571
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,360
[Don't tell me he isn't coming.]

572
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,960
You are here.

573
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,560
You alone?

574
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,590
Of course, we're having
a one on one match.

575
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,920
You're afraid that others
would see you lose badly?

576
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,840
Cut it out. Are we going to play or not?

577
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,840
How should we go about?

578
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,760
I challenged you. You'll set the rules.

579
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,560
Okay, how about this?

580
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,660
You play offense and I, defense.

581
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,020
Twenty minutes per round.

582
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
If you score a goal,

583
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,520
that means I lose.

584
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,040
Okay.
