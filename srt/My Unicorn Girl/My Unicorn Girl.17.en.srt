00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,180
This is our new jersey.

6

-Put it on.
-This looks awesome!

to say to everyone?

Gather around.
The class monitor has something to say.

It's really not easy.

25
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,250
However, I would like to say...

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,660
whether it is a open tournament or not,

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,380
whether your friends and family
come to support you or not,

The most important thing is...

everyone is passionate about ice hockey.

31
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,260
Even if no one can come and support us,

32
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,300
even if there is no audience,

33
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,860
we will have to do our best.

tell them apart?

We won't make it if we tell everyone
to change their jerseys.

Why don't we stick numbers of
different colours at their back?

One black, one red.

79

from usual.

It's time.

167
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,100
All the best.

168
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,180
[The second period of the match
has begun.]

169
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,900
[The face off is once again between
the captains, Meng Qi and Wen Bing.]

170
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,500
[Wen Bing again has the first possession.]

171
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,600
[The players skate across
the midway in sync.]

172
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,400
[Wen Bing has control of the puck.]

173
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,560
Hurry, go, go!

174
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
[He moves forward!]

175
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,260
[Zhang Kai Wen knocked Wen Bing off to the
side of the rink. He lost the puck.]

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,440
[Meng Qi and the gang passed the puck
to the attacking zone.]

177
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,360
[They have initiated
the defensive counterattack.]

178
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,980
It's okay.

179
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
Look at the referee.

180
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
Is he blind? Look at him.

181
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
He didn't stop them despite the foul.

182
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,120
-Is he a mascot?
-You are so noisy.

183
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
Will you keep quiet?

184
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,040
[The puck is in Meng Qi's possession.]

185
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,400
[He breaks through the heavy siege...]

186
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,760
[and is skating towards
the junior goalie, Xiao Xiao.]

187
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,500
[He shoots!]

188
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,800
[Well done! Another goal!]

189
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,480
[The senior team scores another point.]

190
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,540
[The performance of the freshmen team
is awful,]

191
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,080
[especially their captain, Wen Bing.]

192
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,280
[He can definitely play better.]

193
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,060
[He is not in his best form.]

194
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,060
Wen Bing, don't give up.

195
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,120
We still have time.

196
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
Wen Bing.

197
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,800
I suggest that you consider
changing members.

198
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,000
Coach Ma.

199
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,360
I still can play.

200
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,240
You are not in your best form today.

201
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,120
If you continue playing,
the team will lose even harder.

202
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,240
Coach Ma.

203
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,840
As the vice monitor, I plead to you
not to change out Wen Bing.

204
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,990
This is the debut match
for the freshmen team.

205
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,860
Everyone including the teachers, students
and parents are watching.

206
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,060
Think carefully.

207
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,860
Don't be blinded by emotions.

208
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
I have made up my mind.

209
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,880
We're not switching players.

210
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,560
Whatever happens,

211
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,280
I shall be held solely responsible.

212
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,880
You said we should do our best...

213
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,480
and enjoy the match, right?

214
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,840
So why are you leaving?

215
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,200
I have tried my best.

216
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,220
I leave the rest to you guys.

217
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,780
You are the captain.

218
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,620
You must not leave the rink.

219
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,880
Coach Ma is right.

220
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,520
I am not in my best form to keep playing.

221
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,400
Plus, my mum is in the audience.

222
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,500
I don't want her to see me fail.

223
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
That would confirm everything
she said before.

224
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,640
I bet now...

225
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
she is even more certain that
ice hockey is not for me.

226
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,420
You are meant to play ice hockey.

227
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,180
Trust me.

228
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,670
You are the most talented
ice hockey player that I have ever seen.

229
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,110
I'm asking you as the vice monitor...

230
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,070
to play your best
in the last two periods of the match.

231
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,510
You can do it.

232
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,830
Do your best!

233
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,230
Don't disappoint your mum.

234
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,100
All the best.

[The current score is zero to two.]

239

[Things are not looking good
for the freshmen.]

240
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,430
[It seems that experience
cannot be ignored.]

241

[Sang Tian received the puck
from Shen Wei Lian.]

242

at a very challenging angle.]

to try stop him.]

245

[Nice! Wen Bing received the puck!]

246
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,590
[His performance is different
from before.]

247
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,190
[He makes a rapid breakthrough.]

248

[Shen Wei Lian swings the stick,
preparing to shoot.]

was so smooth!]

is slowly finding their form.

00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,310
[Wow! It's too exciting!
What thrilling strike back.]

327
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,670
[That's an amazing goal!]

328
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,500
All the best!

329
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,510
All the best!

330
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,750
Amazing!

331
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,110
That was awesome!

332
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,220
What are you doing?

333
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,990
That was great!

334
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,260
Come.

335
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,580
Come.

336
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,820
Come.

337
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,230
Good job, son!

338
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,830
That was awesome!

339
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,900
-All the best!
-You are so cool, son!

340
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,860
[Dressing room]

341
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,860
[How do I explain the kiss?]

342
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Just now...

343
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,770
Your performance was not bad.

344
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,430
You are indeed the pride
of the freshmen team.

345
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,390
I meant what happened at the hallway.

346
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,310
It was just a revenge.

347
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,750
Don't get me wrong.

348
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,270
It's just a misunderstanding?

349
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,630
You sprang on me just now.

350
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,270
Watch your word.

351
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,790
That was because...

352
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,990
I worried that if you lose the match,

353
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,430
your mum would take you back to Singapore
and I will never see you again.

354
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,500
-So?
-So...

355
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,100
So I have to seek revenge.

356
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,990
You kissed me so many times before.

357
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,340
Three times.

358
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,500
Adding this one,

359
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,100
it's four times in total.

360
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,270
Why do you keep counting?

361
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,830
Thing is, I have to kiss you back...

362
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,150
while you're still here.

363
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,470
This is me.

364
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,110
I repay kindness and seek revenge
accordingly.

365
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,790
I don't like to owe people.

366
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,230
How about this?

367
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,230
Let's just say we're now even.

368
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,030
Even?

369
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,030
I kissed you three times.

370
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,350
You only kissed me once.

371
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,750
How is that even?

372
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,710
Did you learn your math from Coach Ma?

373
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,510
I am just being generous.
It's not worth niggling over.

374
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,670
That's for the best.

375
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,390
It's better than having you
accidentally...

376
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,790
fall in love with me.

377
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,100
Don't flatter yourself.

378
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,780
I would rather fall in love with Xiao Xiao
than you.

379
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,180
Xiao Xiao?

380
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,660
What has she done?

381
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,860
Look out! I might tell her.

382
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,870
It just struck me.
During the match just now,

383
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,630
Xiao Xiao seemed unhappy.

384
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,710
I wonder if he got upset because
he didn't perform well.

385
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,990
As the class monitor,
you should talk to him.

386
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,350
You're just using that title
as an excuse, huh?

387
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,190
You are in power while I am
just a dispatch to you.

388
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,550
We are best buddies. We are one.

389
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,430
-Who is your buddy?
-Who else?

390
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,710
Auntie, you came.

391
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,550
Wen Bing won the match because
you were there to support him.

392
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,790
You are my...

393
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,320
No, I mean you are Wen Bing's Lucky Fairy.

394
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,910
-Superman!
-Yeah!

395
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,550
Madam.

396
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,510
Does that mean
in every future competition,

397
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,950
I will have to be there so that
you can win the match.

398
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,950
See?

399
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,310
The coach of the Ice Hockey Department...

400
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,830
is so not professional.

401
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,710
Sister.

402
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,030
Actually, Coach Ma is quite good.

403
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,350
Not only she is beautiful,
she is also kind.

404
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,590
But she needs to be skillful in the game.

405
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,310
Based on your current standards,

406
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,820
I've hired a National
Hockey League player,

407
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,820
last year's recipient
of the Hart Memorial Award,

408
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,700
to be the visiting coach.

409
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,350
Mom. Do you mean...

410
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,590
Your mom is saying that...

411
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,590
she agrees to let you play ice hockey.

412
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,510
I didn't say that I would support him.

413
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,980
If you are serious about playing,

414
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,630
make sure you do your best.

415
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,220
Play at your best level in every game.

416
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,590
Four years from now,

417
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,770
you will have to take over my company
without fail.

418
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,600
I bet you would...

419
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,710
forget about ice hockey by then.

420
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,550
You left something behind at the dorm.

421
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,950
I brought it for you.

422
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,860
Auntie, I suddenly remembered
that I have something to do.

423
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,100
I have to go.

424
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,470
Uncle, you have something
to do too, right?

425
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,350
Sis, I have to make a call.

426
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,070
You two continue chatting.

427
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,730
Bye, auntie.

428
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,710
Xiao Xiao.

429
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,510
Is someone missing you?

430
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,910
Did someone scold you?

431
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,790
What's wrong?

432
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,470
I was just kidding.

433
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,350
We won today's match.

434
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,300
You should feel happy.

435
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,910
I performed poorly.

436
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,510
Coach Ma is right.

437
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,430
I am not even close to being
a qualified goalie.

438
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,410
Why do you think so?

439
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,710
Look.

440
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,470
The six of us each have
our own weaknesses.

441
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,950
Even Wen Bing is no exception.

442
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,870
The most important thing is,

443
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,630
we can become better...

444
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,910
if we work hard.

445
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,150
Same goes to you.

446
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,420
Compared to the previous match,
I think...

447
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,980
you performed well today.

448
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,910
You did good.

449
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,910
What is so good?

450
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,190
I am not stupid.

451
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,030
Whenever I couldn't guard the goal,

452
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,630
both of you would help me out.

453
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,340
If it weren’t for me, we wouldn't have
fallen behind in the beginning.

454
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,750
On the rink, there is no you and I.

455
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,030
There is only us.

456
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,550
Li He is right.

457
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,310
There is no you and I on the rink.

458
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,390
There is only us.

459
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,860
There is only us.

460
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,990
The rest area is too shabby.

461
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,820
I shall tell the school to renovate it.

462
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,950
Mom

463
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,170
I didn't perform well in the first half
of the match.

464
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,440
I have let you down.

465
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,340
But you still have faith in me.

466
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,290
I will train harder.

467
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,100
Tell me.

468
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,140
Why do you love ice hockey so much?

469
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,150
I don't know.

470
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,520
I just feel that...

471
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,140
when I am holding the stick,

472
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,590
when I put on the skates,

473
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,850
when I fight along my team members...

474
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,030
I am full of energy.

475
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,910
I am so happy.

476
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,670
I feel as if nothing can stop me.

477
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,030
I feel as if I have the courage
to solve every problem.

478
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,420
I hope you remember what you said.

479
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,150
No matter what happens in the future,

480
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,350
even if it is...

481
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,710
a few thousand times harder than this,

482
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,070
you must face it bravely.

483
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,910
Actually, I...

484
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,070
always knew that...

485
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,340
things haven't been easy for you.

486
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,990
However, I also know that...

487
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,110
you have been working hard to overcome it.

488
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,470
You are my best son.

489
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,980
Mom.

490
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,370
That's why you...

491
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,060
wear a red scarf everyday.

492
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,270
It's because of me.

493
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,710
You are my son.

494
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,790
No matter when and where,

495
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,910
I always hope that...

496
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,450
you can recognise me at first glance.

497
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,110
Mum.

498
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,170
I am sorry.

499
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,510
Why are you apologizing?

500
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,820
A man shouldn't cry so easily.

501
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,429
The only exception is when
you are in front...

502
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,750
of your mum.

503
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,590
I am not crying.

504
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,270
Happy birthday!

505
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
[Happy birthday, Mum]

506
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,710
It's because of you...

507
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,310
that the red scarf
has become a part of me.

508
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,190
Come, put it on for me.

509
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Looks lovely.

510
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,500
Thank you.

511
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,020
Happy birthday.

512
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,140
Mum.

513
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,840
I hope that you will always wear it.

514
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,110
That's for sure.

515
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,900
I almost forgot.

516
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,070
I have arranged a feast...

517
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,470
for you to celebrate the victory
with your coach and team members.

518
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,310
How did you know that we would win?

519
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,910
What if we had lost?

520
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,730
Why can't we celebrate if you lose?

521
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,830
Always remember.

522
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,870
In a match,

523
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,390
the most important thing
is not about winning.

524
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,940
It's about enjoying the process.

525
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,190
You performed well today, didn't you?

526
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,590
Thank you, Mum.

527
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,420
But...

528
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,390
I have a date with someone tonight.

529
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,940
Another day maybe?

530
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,550
Alright.

531
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,580
You guys can celebrate it another day.

532
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,910
Take care of yourself.

533
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,940
Don't worry, Mum.

534
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,270
Now,

535
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,830
knowing that Sang Tian will
take good care of you,

536
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,270
I feel relieved.

537
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,530
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

538
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,910
Sure.

539
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,350
I will take care of him.

540
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,110
Chairman.

541
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,590
Your mum finally left.

542
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,140
Let's go for dinner.

543
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,300
Uncle.

544
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,750
Something happened during the match.

545
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,320
You mean the jersey? Don't worry about it.

546
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,940
It's about Sang Tian.

547
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,910
Are you saying...

548
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,610
you managed to win the match today...

549
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,950
because of the kiss?

550
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,220
You son of a gun!

551
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,270
You promised not to bully her...

552
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,870
but you kissed her.

553
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,190
I didn't kiss her.

554
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,270
You mean she kissed you?

555
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,310
Are you serious?

556
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,220
You are doomed.

557
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,270
Listen.

558
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,670
I think she has fallen in love with you.

559
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,700
You really think that she likes me?

560
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,230
Of course.

561
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,590
Listen.

562
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,270
Between a man and a woman...

563
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,350
Between a man and a woman...

564
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,040
It's complicated.

565
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,660
I'm sure she likes you.

566
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,190
I have to go.

567
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,230
I have something to do.

568
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,430
I'll talk to you later.

569
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,710
I am leaving.

570
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,180
She likes me? Really?

571
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,970
Coach Ma.

572
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,050
Let's go for a meal.

573
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,020
My sister told me to thank you
for looking after Bing Bing.

574
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,770
It's not a big deal. I am not free.

575
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,430
It's okay. Can I add you on WeChat?

576
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,950
I have stopped using Wechat.

577
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,850
And...

578
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,190
if you won't stop following me,
I will report to the police.

579
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,280
Ma...

580
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,860
Don't give up.

581
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,780
She has always been like this.

582
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,630
Offending her...

583
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,070
is equal to a death sentence.

584
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,300
So I'm dead?

585
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,720
If you wish to live,

586
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,400
you have to be determined and patient...

587
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,740
in making her happy.

588
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,680
No way you can please her
in one or two attempts.

589
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,530
How many times then?

590
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,830
I don't know.

591
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,150
All I know is, to date,

592
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,350
no one has been able to stay alive.

593

They're all dead?

594
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,390
All the best.

You have my mental support.
You can do it!

597
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,230
Hold on.

598
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,790
Didn't you break up with
the personal trainer?

-We got back together.
-What?

Unlike Senior Ma. it's easy
to make me happy.

601

He thinks that you are too old
for him, right?

602
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,270
I misunderstood him.

603
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:20,430
He was not angry about my age.
It was because I lied to him.

604
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,910
What did you lie to him about?

605
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,550
I told him I just turned 20.

606
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,060
That's too much!

[Liuye Sports University]

608
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,660
Why was I so impulsive?

609
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,470
But under that circumstance, I couldn't
get away without kissing him.

610
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,350
No doubt we won the match.

611
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,910
But if he asks me...

612
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
How should I explain it?

613
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,950
I can't tell him...

614
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,440
that I know he has face blindness, right?

615
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,260
What happened to your hand?

616
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,430
You went to send off your mum, right?

617
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,540
Before my mum left, she told me
to get my hands checked.

618
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,550
According to the doctor,
this might be a relapse.

619
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,950
He told me to put in on for two days.

620

Really?

What do you think?

622
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,380
Who on earth would put it on for nothing?

Okay.

I think I better get you a babysitter.

Can you afford it?

Fine, I'll do it.
