00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,200
Hello.

7
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,680
I want an original milk tea.
Normal sugar, add ice.

8
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120

Please come next time.

12
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,280
Sang Tian and I are best friends.

13
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Can you sell me one cup for him?

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
Alright.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,880
Only this time, no next time.

16
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Can I ask you a question?

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Go ahead.

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,000
How long have you
and Sang Tian been together?

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
Quite long, why?

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,680
Did he ever do anything romantic for you?

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,920
Why do you ask about this?

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Nothing.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,360
I fell in love with someone recently.

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,240
But I have less experience in love.

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
So I want to ask how did he pursue you?
I want to learn from him.

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,400
He bought fruits for me before.

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,400
Did he pick it during the outing?

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,560
What did you guys do
when go shopping?

29
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,079
Shopping.

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,600
Buy clothes, do manicure and eat.

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,880
Manicure?

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,440
Of course is he accompany me to do it.
He accompanies me to do it.

33
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,120
I’m the one who did manicure.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
[Why is he so quiet?]

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,440
[Has he noticed something?]

36
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,200
We're closed.
Quickly pay me and leave.

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
This is just right, take it.

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,280
Why are you still here?
Leave now.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thanks for your milk tea.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,800
[Oh no.]

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,200
Did I slip my tongue?

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
-Let's go to play this weekend.
-All right.

43
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Beautiful.

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,440
-Quick, come over here.
-Quickly come over here.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
Anyone?

46
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,240
-Here.
-Wait for me.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,880
-Cannot.
-Here.

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,360
Let's go.
It's starting soon.

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,800
[She's a girl...]

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,360
[but she stayed in
such a foul environment.]

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,079
[It's too dangerous.]

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,240
Wei Lian, what's up?

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,920
Nothing.

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Are you hungry?
Do you want to have breakfast together?

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
No thanks. I just ate.

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,760
That's great.
I'll leave now.

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,640
What's going on?

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,640
Why did both Wen Bing and Wei Lian
act strangely recently?

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,240
Miao Miao.

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Miao Miao.

61
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,440
Something bothering you?

62
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,890
Wait, don't speak first.

63
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,000
Let me guess.

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,360
It should be related to the person
who made your heart beat faster, right?

65
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
You're right.

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,920
I knew about her secret.
A huge secret.

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,480
Help me to think.

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,040
As her friend,

69
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,000
should I tell her...

70
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,320
I already knew about it
or pretend to not know about it?

71
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,640
If I were you,

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,640
I'll not tell her.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,680
Why are you so sure?

74
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,280
You're best friends, right?

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
Yeah, that's why I feel that friends
should be honest with each other.

76
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,720
No, strangers should be honest
to each other.

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,400
The real best friends
should pretend not to know.

78
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,000
Pretend not to know?

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,160
Understand?

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
It's simple.

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,000
Since it's a secret,

82
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,600
it means that she doesn't want
anyone to know about it.

83
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,760
She tried so hard to keep the secret,
she must have a reason.

84
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,920
So, the real best friends
should be understanding and trust her.

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,600
You mean you want me to
help her keep her secret?

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,120
To protect her secret?

87
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,720
-This is like...
-This is like the guardian knight.

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,640
Guardian knight?

89
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,760
I want to be her guardian knight.

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
To protect her.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
-Sang Tian, careful.
-Careful!

92
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,240
[His reaction is quick today.]

93
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
[He wanted to fight with me.]

94
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,520
[Two knights?]

95
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,159
[Did he also realise that
Sang Tian is a girl?]

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,640
-Sang Tian, are you all right?
-Sang Tian, are you all right?

97
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,560
Yeah.

98
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,840
That's great.

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Huang Hao Ran is absent again today?

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,920
He's late for more than two hours.
He's late every day.

101
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,080
Sang Tian, call him.

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
You're the class monitor,
you should call him.

103
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm the class monitor,
so you should listen to me.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Call him now.

105
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,200
Fine.

106
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm late again.

108
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,680
Huang Hao Ran.

109
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,440
Did something happen recently?

110
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,000
Nothing?
Why are you always late then?

111
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Tell me truthfully,
did you go dating?

112
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,440
No.

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,880
Do you still want to deny it?
Huang Hao Ran, I'm warning you.

114
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,640
Next week is our first open match.

115
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,680
Can you pay more attention
at this crucial moment?

116
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,920
Can you deal with your girlfriend
after the match?

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,080
The match is so important.
Why are you dating?

118
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,200
That's right.
You're always like that.

119
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,240
-Do you still want to fight?
-Enough!

120
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,520
Huang Hao Ran.

121
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,040
As the class monitor,
I need to remind you.

122
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,920
Being part of the school team
doesn't mean that you can relax.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,280
You still need to practice.

124
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,640
Yeah, if your performance
is not good or fail,

125
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
Coach Ma will still kick you out.

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,400
Not serious in training.
What do you want to do?

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Do you still want to practise?

128
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,640
Do you want to practise or not?
If not, leave now.

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,880
Enough...

130
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,320
Fine.

131
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
I'll leave.

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,000
I wanted to leave a long time ago.

133
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Does Huang Hao Ran
also have a brother like Wei Lian?

134
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,400
What are you saying?

135
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,440
What's wrong with Huang Hao Ran today?

136
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,760
He's normally Mr. Nice with no temper.

137
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Why is he so mad today?
He even broke the equipment.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,240
Am I too over?
It's not that serious, right?

139
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,880
To be honest, comparing to how you
normally mock me,

140
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
that's really nothing.

141
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,120
Zi Yi, I'm not in the mood
to fight with you.

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,480
Can you stop giving me pressure?
Stop bothering me!

143
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Do you not understand me
or is it that I don't understand you?

144
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,960
If you continue to be so unreasonable,
there's nothing I can do.

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,480
All right, let's break up then!

146
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,520
What are you doing?

147
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,280
He's so fierce.

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,760
Normally, he's not like that.
Why is he so different than before?

149
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
Huang Hao Ran just broke up.

150
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,400
Why don't we go comfort him?

151
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,160
You go first.

152
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,680
I don't want to.
You go yourself if you want.

153
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,520
Why don't you have any sympathy?

154
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,240
He's an adult.
Let him handle love issues himself.

155
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,320
Are you sure...

156
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,400
he won't do stupid things?

157
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,000
If he can't even control his emotions,
he's not fit to stay in our team.

158
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,750
You're so inhuman.

159
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,640
Indeed a hypocrite.
Not humane at all.

160
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,040
Yes, I'm a hypocrite.

161
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,360
If you broke up with that milk tea girl,
don't think that I'll comfort you.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Don't worry,
I won't have any problem with Xiao Rou.

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
I won't ever trouble you.

164
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,040
However,

165
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,840
my principle is different than yours.

166

if you break up one day,

we're friends, you can come to me
for me to comfort you.

169

Of course.

174
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,880
Myself.

175
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,720
So I won't break up
in my whole life.

That is also RMB2,900.

179
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,400
So expensive for such a small bottle?

180
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,160
That is our latest product too.

181

when he's a child.

329
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,040
This is the history
of Huang Hao Ran's ice hockey journey.

330
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Look.
This is a picture of him in a game.

331
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,640
This one too.

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
Sang Tian, Wen Bing,
come and eat fruits.

333
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,440
Come, sit down.

334
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,320
Be careful.

335
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
Thank you.

336
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,400
Come.

337
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,720
Hao Ran always mention about you all.

338
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,040
I can remember all your names.

339
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,920
There's Li He and Xiao Xiao, right?

340
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Aunty, you're amazing.
You can remember all our names?

341
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,280
-Drink some water.
-Mother, your leg has not recovered.

342
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,120
Let me do it.
Sit down and rest.

343
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
All right.

344
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,560
Aunty, your leg...

345
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,280
It's nothing serious.

346
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,520
I accidentally fell
when I was fixing a car two days ago.

347
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,800
No one can take care of the shop.

348
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,880
Hao Ran insisted to help.

349
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,440
I've told him many times,

350
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,680
his hands are to hold the hockey stick,
he shouldn't be repairing cars.

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
But he won't listen to me.

352
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,360
It's great that you're here.

353
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
-Help me to persuade him.
-No need for that.

354
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,680
Mother, I will not go back
until your leg recovers.

355
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Hao Ran, what are you saying?

356
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
You don't want to continue your studies?

357
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
My hard work all these years
will go to waste.

358
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,440
I don't want you to
work so hard again.

359
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,600
In order to let me learn ice hockey,

360
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,000
you get up early daily
to repair and wash cars. I...

361
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,040
Hao Ran.

362
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
As long as you're doing what you like,

363
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
I'll be very happy.

364
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,160
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,880
I didn't tell you
when I didn't go to practice.

366
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,000
With my mother's current condition,
I'm worried about her.

367
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,160
-So, I...
-Huang Hao Ran.

368
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,680
Dr. Zheng is a famous orthopedist.

369
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,000
I've contacted him.

370
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,520
From tomorrow onwards,

371
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,680
he'll come to check on aunty
and help her do rehabilitation...

372
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,040
until she recovers.

373
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,840
Thank you, Wen Bing.

374
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,080
Thank you so much.

375
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,240
I'll not send you off.

376
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
I need to wash another two cars.

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,960
This one?

378
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,320
Or this one?

379
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,280
Or these two?

380
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,730
Why are you guys here?

381
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,320
Sang Tian asked us to come.

382
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Liuye Car Wash is officially opened.

383
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,360
[Mary Car Repair]

384
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,680
Xiao Xiao!

385
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,800
Are you all right?

386
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,360
Yes.

387
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,440
Xiao Xiao, you're dead.

388
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Help me get revenge.

389
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,520
Xiao Xiao!

390
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,960
Hello.

391
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,720
All right, I got it.

392
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,240
What's wrong?
What happened?

393
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,600
My mother is back

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
All right, my mission has been completed.

395
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
I leave the rest to you.
Keep it up.

396
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,640
Hello, Chairman.

397
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,560
Those two ladies
are so pretty and elegant.

398
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,960
Mother.

399
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,560
What are you doing?

400
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,240
This is...

401
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,160
This is my best buddy, Sang Tian.

402
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
Hello, aunty.

403
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,160
Since you're here,
why not join us for lunch?

404
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,440
Over here, please.

405
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,200
Why didn't you tell me
your mother is so pretty?

406
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,880
Thank you.

407
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,350
Sang Tian.

408
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,760
Don't need to be nervous
when eat with me.

409
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,480
Just relax.

410
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,320
Mother.

411
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,080
He won't be nervous
when he starts to eat later.

412
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,040
All right.

413
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,760
Oh, right.

414
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,680
What's the surname of the professor
who taught...

415
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
the Principles of Economics at Shuren?

416
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,680
Professor...

417
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,120
Professor Liu.

418
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
Is he still teaching?

419
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,560
I think he's retired.

420
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Retired?

421
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,480
Mother, you're wasting time to ask him.

422
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
He skipped classes every day.

423
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,960
He doesn't even remember
his homeroom teacher's name.

424
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,960
Right?

425
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,320
Yes.

426
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,880
Yes, aunty.

427
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,520
Are you hungry?
Let's eat.

428
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,960
Bing Bing, which one do you like?

429
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
Oh, right.

430
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,800
Is Bing Bing popular with girls
at school?

431
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,680
Our class doesn't have girls.

432
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,840
Figure skating.

433
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,080
The girls from Figure Skating Department
quite like him.

434
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,640
Sang Tian, didn't you say you want to
send visa application materials...

435
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,520
to your brother at noon?

436
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
It is too late now?

437
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,480
No.

438
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,870
You are full now.

439
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,200
I...

440
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,080
Secretary Jin.

441
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,280
Please send him back.

442
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,600
All right.

443
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,800
Hurry up and leave.

444
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,960
Aunty, I'll leave now.

445
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,680
All right.

446
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,040
Over here, please.

447
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,320
Goodbye, aunty.

448
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,760
-Waiter, please go out.
-All right.

449
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,350
Sang Tian...

450
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
is not your classmate in Shuren, right?

451
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,360
Yeah.

452
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,480
Then he's...

453
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,280
He's my classmate in Liuye's
Ice Hockey Department.

454
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,320
Very good.

455
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,320
I'm happy that you are truthful to me.

456
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,000
However, ice hockey is more suitable
to be a hobby for you.

457
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,760
If you want it to become
your long-life career,

458
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,160
I think...

459
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,120
you should reconsider it.

460
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,120
Economic Management
in Shuren School of Business...

461
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
is one of the best in this country.

462
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,800
It's not easy to get admitted.

463
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,360
The same goes for
Liuye's Ice Hockey Department.

464
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,680
Mother, I've grown up.

465
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,400
I know what I'm doing
and what I want to do in the future.

466
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,800
I hope that you won't oppose me.

467
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,520
I've never opposed you
to play ice hockey.

468
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,640
I just think that this path
is too hard for you.

469
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,960
There's a lot of uncertainty
in the future.

470
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,880
So, in order for you
to face fewer hardships,

471
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,800
I suggest you choose Shuren.

472
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Yes.

473
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,960
Help you in Wen Group
after graduating from Shuren...

474
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,520
is indeed a shortcut.

475
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,080
But that's the best choice for you,
not for me.

476
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,320
I don't need many possibilities
in my future.

477
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,320
I just want to do one thing right.

478
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,600
That is to play ice hockey.

479
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,600
You just returned home today.

480
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,760
Rest well after eating.

481
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Don't work too hard.

482
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,040
Kill!

483
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
Go!

484
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,960
Quick!

485
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,000
Quick!

486
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Good.

487
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
[Sad, let's play another match.]

488
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,960
[Sad, let's play another match.]

489
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,840
[No, I have a cold.]
[I want to sleep soon.]

490
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,680
[Why? Something's wrong?]

491
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,440
[Nothing.]
[It's all because of that pervert.]

492
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,040
[I went to return the down jacket
but he didn't appear.]

493
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,680

and understanding.

She's not like what you told me.

You don't even know their names, right?

Is this important?

628
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,720
It's indeed unimportant for you.

629
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
Because they're just a passerby
in your eyes.

630

But for me,
they're my friends, my teammates.

631
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,160
Because they're your friends,
so I treated them.

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,320
Don't make it sound so good.

633
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,720
You just want to bribe them
and affect our training.

634
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,920
If they're really your friends,

635
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,040
yet so easily bribed,

636
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,560
you should really consider
if they're suitable to be your teammates.

637
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,560
You're wrong.

They would eat this meal...

639
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,040
because they thought I have a good mother
who supports me to play ice hockey.

640
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,960
Have I ever oppose you?

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes.

642
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,200
You've never opposed me directly.

643
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,760
But in your heart,
you've never supported me as well.

644
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,640
You're the one who told me...

no matter what obstacles I encounter,

I should insist on my dreams.

You're still young back then.

648

You're a grown-up now.

650
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,800
You should understand this.

651
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,880
Dreams are achievable.

652
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,920
If it can't be achieved,
it can only be called a delusion.

653
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,040
If you can't overcome all the obstacles,

654
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,040
then you should learn
to stop the loss in time.

655
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,600
Do you know
what's my biggest obstacle now?

656
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,680
It's you.

657
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,920
Sang Tian, what's wrong today?

658
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,840
His mother only treated us to a meal
and gave us gifts.

659
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Why is he so mad?

660
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,880
Wen Bing's mad at his mother
just because of these?

661
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,040
Yeah.

662
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,200
Wei Lian, I'll go look for Wen Bing.
You guys practise first.

663
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,400
Practice well.

664
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,360
All right.

665
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,800
[If I encounter such thing,]

666
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,720
[will she care about me that much too?]

667
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,240
[Shen Wei Lian.]

668
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,840
[How can you think so?]

669
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,040
[You're too narrow-minded and selfish.]

670
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,680
[During this time,
you should care about Wen Bing...]

671
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,680
[just like her.]

672
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,200
Wen Bing and Sang Tian have left.
Why are we still here?

673
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,120
Why not go back and rest?
Dismissed.

674
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,000
Xiao Xiao.

675
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,560
You're wrong.

676
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,120
We should be energetic.

677
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,520
We must not let Sang Tian down.

678
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,640
-Come, let's continue to practise.
-Let's go.

679
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,040
Practice.
