Little bunny, you have to be good.

So beautiful.

When you wear this, it looks
as if it is specially made for you.

130
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,330
Isn't this skirt too short?

131
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,130
No.

132
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,770
Look, this dress shows
your body shape very well.

133

No.

138
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,530
I think let's forget it.

139
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,770
I have said it, right?
It's not what you think.

140
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,890
Just listen to me.

141
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,010
I'll pay the bills.

144
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,450
Give me your cell phone!

145
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,370
Cellphone?

146
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,810
Why do I need to give it to you?

147
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,930
Because I heard you calling
another girl bunny at the entrance.

148
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,970
You...

149
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,170
That's my sister.

150
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,890
Because her zodiac is the rabbit,
that's why we call her bunny.

151
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,930
I'm used to it. Do you have a problem?

152
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,290
Really?

153
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,050
Then, show your handphone to
Chen Chen to see whether it's true.

154
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,890
Show it.

155
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,930
Okay, I'll show.

156
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,690
Chen Chen...

157
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,970
Is it true?

158
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,050
Who knows how many
little sisters you have?

159
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,810
What little? What did you say?

160
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,970
I realised that you're always around
when Chen Chen and I go somewhere.

161
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,970
I knew it! Chen Chen, he is following us.

162
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,450
He is a maniac and disgusting.

163
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,970
No, it's not.

164
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,970
-Chen Chen, this is a misunderstanding.
-Ignore him. Let's go.

165
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,330
Chen Chen...

166
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,610
-You didn't take your clothes.
-Chen Chen, listen to me.

167
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,810
-Your legs are short but you ran so fast.
-Shut up! You're a bad guy.

168
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,450
Chen Chen, I really heard it just now.
You have to trust me.

169
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,970
-If he's bad, what are you?
-Yes.

170
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,250
Single and never dated before.

171
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,610
You're so old,
yet still never dated before?

172
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,530
Chen Chen, I was single before I met you.

173
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,490
You...

174
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,330
Chen Chen, I'm not like him.
He has a lot of good sisters.

175
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,570
I only have you.

176
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,770
Please respect us.

177
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,530
Don't disturb my date with my girlfriend.

178
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,890
-You...
-What? Let go!

179
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,610
When did I say I'm your girlfriend?

180
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,210
-No, we are...
-True.

181
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,370
I...

182
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,690
Chen Chen!

183
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,930
What's wrong with you?

184
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,890
It's always you.

185
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,250
Just a bit more.

186
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,850
You...

187
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,090
Bad guy!

188
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,930
-I'll pick a call, you can go in first.
-OK.

189
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,850
-Hello.
-Hello, Fei Fei.

190
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,330
Do me a favour.

191
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,610
I'm busy dating.

192
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,330
[What?]

193
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,970
Did you get back together with him again?

194
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,450
Quickly tell me what it is.

195
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,250
Help me to investigate someone.

196
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,370
Qin Lang, right?

197
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,210
Yes, that bad guy.

198
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,650
[Tell me, are you going to help me?]

199
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,570
-Treat me to a meal.
-[No problem.]

200
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,330
You can choose the food and place.

201
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,170
You won't get me to pay
this time again, right?

202
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,330
I'll bring cash this time.

203
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,970
You can eat as much as you want.

204
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,690
Okay, no problem.

205
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,090
Looking at your sincerity...

206
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,130
I'll help you this time.

207
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,290
-I'll get some useful information.
-Deal.

208
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,730
Quick, he's in front.

209
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,130
Very handsome.

210
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,530
Where are the girls going?

211
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,730
Don't know.

212
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,850
-Let's go to have a look too.
-OK.

213
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,650
Don't push.
Don't push everyone.

214
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,650
Take a step back.

215
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,770
Don't push. Take a step back.

216
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,130
Look at each other affectionately.

217
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,570
Correct.

218
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,570
That's Wen Bing, right?

219
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,290
Handsome...

He's so handsome.

223
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,330
Handsome, look at my camera.

224
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,810
Correct.

225
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:44,970
Stay there.

We'll shoot a set of
prince and princess photos now.

230

Boy, kneel on one knee.

231
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,090

Boy, kneel on one knee.

233
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,570
Okay, please cooperate.

234
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,890
Both of you, do this.

235

So handsome.

236
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,050
[He will confess here?]

237
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,530
[Prince and princess.]

238
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,810
[Such a good match.]

239
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,650
You're only a cat.

240
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,770
Sang Tian...

241
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,890
Okay, get up.

242
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,849
We'll change the next set of action now.

243
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,450
Okay.

244

Tall and handsome.

246
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,450
Sang Tian...

247
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,290
Why did you run so fast?

248
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,930
Why didn't you say hi to Wen Bing?

249
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,290
It's too hot in there.

250
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,410
I'm here to take a breath.

251
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,450
But you're still wearing this.

252
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,890
I really feel too hot.

253
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,850
I sweated a lot too.

254
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,650
Wait a minute.

255
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,410
Hi, can you give me a tissue?

256
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,450
Let me wipe for you.

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,370
Let me do it.

258
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,370
Sang Tian...

259
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,370
I have something to tell you.

260
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,010
[I don't want to see him
confess to other people.]

261
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,290
Because inside my heart...

262
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,970
I already have a person that I like.

263
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,010
And that person is...

264
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,170
Sang Tian.

265
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,090
Sang Tian.

266
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,210
Sang Tian.

267
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,570
I was stunned for a while.

268
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,210
Wei Lian, what did you say just now?

269
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,650
Nothing.

270
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,330
Looks like something is
bothering you today.

271
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,970
Is there anything?

272
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,930
No, nothing.

273
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,770
We're good brothers.

274
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,810
You can tell me anything.

275

I know a good way to
make you feel better.

Isn't this for me?

279

Sang Tian asked me to buy for him.

280
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,450
He wants to give it to his girlfriend.

281
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,810
So romantic.

282
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,450
I still have something to do.
I'll go first.

283
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,890

after eating this.

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,850
It's so good.

289

Why did you eat my ice cream?

290
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,330
Your ice cream is melting.

I'm just helping.

292

know she's a girl...]

[What if she misunderstands?]

299
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,450
Let's go to the Ferris wheel.

300
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,250
It's better that you go
with someone you like.

301
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,770
Wei Lian, let's go.

302
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,570
Okay.

303
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,850
True.

304
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,930
I should ride the Ferris wheel
with someone I like.

305
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,210
Then...

306
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,250
see you later.

307
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,290
I'm just a little late.

308
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,050
How come everything became a mess?

309
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,010
My perfect plan should be...

310
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,010
my sister and brother-in-law...

311
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,650
enjoy their love on the Ferris wheel.

312
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,210
Looks like I have to make things happen
at such a crucial time.

Maybe let's not go anymore?

You like Wen Bing.

506
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,410
How come you can tell this person
irresponsible things like this?

507
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,370
And you changed your
profile picture for him.

508
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,850
No way.

509
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,410
Delete.

510
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,410
How come she's offline?

511
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,810
Sad.

512
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,730
[Sad! Hello! Sad!! Sent]

513
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,610
Sad.

514
00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:00,090
[Injured Kidney: Sad! Hello! Sad!!
User is offline]

515
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,730
It's all your fault.

516
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,730
How come you’ve confessed to me?

517
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,210
I feel so awkward to
go back to the hostel now.

518
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,770
makes me feel awkward.

519
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,290
If you're not comfortable,
I can sleep at home tonight.

520
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,010
I don't mean that.

521
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:42,970
You want me to stay?

522
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,250
No.

523
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,410
I'm just feeling...

524
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,410
It's a little late tonight.

525
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,850
Listen carefully.

526
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,370
No matter what reply you give to me...

527
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,850
I'll not blame you.

528
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,650
We'll still be like before.

529
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,130
Therefore, you don't have to
feel pressured.

530
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,130
Let's go. It's cold outside.

531
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,890
[How can I not feel pressured?]

532
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,810
[I'm still a male in his eyes.]

533
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,210
[At least, before I answer him...]

534
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,890
[I should let him know I'm a girl.]

535
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,810
[But how do I say something like this?]

536
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,050
Am I beautiful?

537
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,650
Don't you think that sometimes...

538
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,170
I am a bit...

539
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,850
sissy?

540
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,170
Actually, I have a few days in a
month that I'm not feeling well.

541
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,210
I mean...

542
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,290
He definitely cannot understand.

543
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,610
Looks like I can only...

544
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,210
use my secret weapon.

545
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,490
Heartbeat.

546
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,210
You're not cold?

547
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,290
My eyes are swollen.

548
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,410
I need to relieve the
swelling in the fridge.

549
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,090
Can you take the eye drops for me?

550
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:21,930
It's inside that...

551
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,810
metal box.

552
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,930
How come not painful anymore?

553
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,890
She's so pretty.

554
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,690
Who is this?

555
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:58,890
My sister.

556
00:42:59,050 --> 00:42:59,850
Your sister?

557
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,850
How come I haven't heard about her?

558
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,890
She went overseas at a very young age.

559
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,610
You're Sang Tian.

560
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,810
Your brother is Sang Zhan.

561
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,130
What's her name?

562
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,170
Sang Ye.

563
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,250
How is it?

564
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:22,290
She looks exactly the same as me, right?

565
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,370
Previously, you said that...

566
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,650
you like me very much.

567
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,850
How about I introduce her to you?

568
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,810
How does that sound like?

569
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,050
What do you mean?

570
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,090
You should tell me if you agree.

571
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,090
Do you think she's not pretty?

572
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,610
-Very pretty.
-Everything is good then.

573
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,370
You like me.

574
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,810
She looks exactly the same
like me and she's very pretty.

575
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,170
Why don't you agree?
