[Episode 8]

4
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,289
[So, you're his "guide dog"!]

5
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,190
Anyway, I won't bother you anymore.
I'll move out tomorrow.

6
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,870
Also, you and Wei Lian
can find another teammate.

7
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,310
Just find whoever, I'm not going.

8
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,550
Why didn't it go as planned?

9
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,110
What a fool.

10
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,390
You said you wanted to say goodbye nicely.

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,960
But what did you just tell him?

12
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,870
What's wrong?

13
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,810
Nothing.

14
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,040
Did you quarrel with someone?

15
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,550
I guess so.

16
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,150
But you're feeling regret now?

17
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,750
Actually,

18
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,590
I wanted to say goodbye to him nicely.

19
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,390
But who knows once I opened my mouth,

20
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,670
we ended up fighting.

21
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,870
Maybe you did it purposely.

22
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,870
You intentionally ruined
his impression on you...

23
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,950
so that when you leave,
he can forget about you.

24
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,030
No!

25
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,550
I don't want him to forget
about me so quickly.

26
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,870
It seems like he's very important to you.

27
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,950
Right?

28
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,470
In that case, I'll give you an idea.

29
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,910
If speech can't convey the meaning,
try to write a letter.

30
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,230
Thoughtful writing
is more real and precise.

31
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,270
So, if you can't say goodbye
to him nicely in person,

32
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,190
you can try writing a letter.

33
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,230
Seriously?

34
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,670
A carrot and stick approach?

35
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,310
Is she having schizophrenia?

36
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,550
[Cheng Min Jun: Wen Bing, I've received
the report from Dr. Smith.]

[Wen Bing. I've received
the report from Dr. Smith.]

38
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,310
-How many dishes have we ordered?
-Seven.

39
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,510
Seven?

40
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,350
Then, add fried rice for two.

41
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,230
Alright.

42
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,150
No need, I'm on a diet.
One portion will do.

43
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,230
For one person then.

44
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,430
And two abalones.

45
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,790
No need, I'm allergic to seafood.

46
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,030
One portion will do.

47
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,150
I want to eat two portions.

48
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,990
Alright, two portions.

49
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,150
Alright.

50
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,590
And borscht for two.

51
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,190
No need, I'll just drink water.

52
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,990
For one then.

53
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,430
-Alright.
-A big portion.

54
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,990
And then...

55
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,030
I think these will do.

56
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,870
It'll be wasted if we order too much.

57
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,070
Alright, that's all for now.

58
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,350
Sure.

59
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,990
Alright, we need to accept payment
before serving the dishes.

60
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,830
The total is RMB1,888.

61
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,630
-What's wrong?
-Who'll pay?

62
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,030
Nothing, I drank too fast.

63
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,070
-How much was it?
-RMB1,888.

64
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,590
What an auspicious number. Let me pay.

65
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,030
Swipe my card.

66
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,030
Alright.

67
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,190
Mr. Cheng, you're really
environmental friendly.

68
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,510
It's nothing.

69
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,190
Oh, right, I left in a hurry that day.
I forgot to tell you that...

70
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,070
Coach Ma Chen Chen
is Wen Bing's main coach.

71
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,310
I'm in charge of
Figure Skating Department.

72
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,590
So, it's better to ask her about Wen Bing.

73
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,870
It's alright.

74
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,230
Ice hockey and figure skating
are one family, right?

75
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,590
Furthermore, you both are coach.

76
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,830
Coach Ma doesn't seem
like an easygoing person.

77
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,750
Am I really that fearful?

78
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,630
You...

79
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,750
Senior.

80
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,870
Well, I said you are...

81
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,070
No, I said you're fearful.

82
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,390
No.

83
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,110
What I meant was you're more strict.

84
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,150
Yeah? That's because you have
so many students, right?

85
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,790
You must establish prestige.

86
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,430
-Prestige.
-Yeah. Senior, what a coincidence.

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,630
-Come and join us.
-No need.

88
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,870
We can talk at school.

89
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,950
Waiter, I want to place order.

90

[Young Master Bing Bing]

91
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,870
Don't mind her.

92
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,110
Her personality is like that.

93
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,630
She didn't mean anything.

94
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,190
It's alright.

95
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,230
She's with the boys every day.
I understand.

96
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,990
-I need to answer the call.
-Alright.

97
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,230
Hello.

98
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,470
Excuse me, mister. Your card was declined.

99
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,910
Do you have another card?

100
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,350
How could that be?

101
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,950
This card was declined?

102
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,590
Is it your machine?

103
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,990
Coach Ma.

104
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,950
Can you...

105
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,430
You want to borrow money?

106
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,670
No.

107
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,870
Please wait for a moment.

108
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,230
What's wrong?

109
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,950
Nothing.

110
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,830
I told the waitress that
I want to order some drinks.

111
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,470
What should I order?

112
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,150
I'm sorry,
this mister's card was declined.

113
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,230
So...

114
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,870
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,510
I went out in a rush today,
I forgot to bring my purse.

116
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,550
It's alright.

117
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,270
We can't let a woman pay, right?

118
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,270
I might have brought the wrong card.

119
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,590
I have too many cards.
I should have another card.

-Swipe my card.

139

Wen Bing?

140
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,590
[Since you like the shirt so much,
I'll give it to you.]

[But about grouping,
you must listen to me.]

[No matter who our last teammate will be,]

It seems like Senior Miao  is right.

148
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,110
Written words are indeed different.

149

[Dear Wen Bing!]

150
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,230
What happened today?
Why can't I find anyone?

-Hello, Cheng Min Jun.
-Yes, nephew?

Alright, I'll take it to you later.

154

Where is my bag?

Hello.

Hi.

158
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,030
I was the customer who spent RMB1,888
at your restaurant just now.

159
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,670
-[Hello.]
-Well...

160
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,590
I left my briefcase there.

161
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,230
[It's taken.]

162
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,670
Taken?

163
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,670
[It's taken by the customer
who helped you to pay.]

164

Alright.

Coach Ma?

166
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,190
What should I do?

167
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,110
What should I do?

168

Oh, gosh.

171
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,830
My gosh. There must be a way.

172
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,870
There will be a way. I must calm down.

Wen Bing's uncle.

The wrong hockey stick.

181
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,030
I have a favor to ask you, it's important.

182
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,750
-What is it?
-It's quite complicated,

183
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,430
and urgent. I'll make it short.

184
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,680
I have a black bag, it's with Coach Ma.

185
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,390
I'll lead Coach Ma away later.

186
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,990
You go the office and help me get the bag.

187
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,950
You mean, steal it?

188
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,910
That's my bag, it's not stealing.

189
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,150
Then, why do you ask me to do it?

190
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,670
You can just ask Wen Bing to take it.

191
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,310
No way.

192
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,830
Listen.

193
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,070
There's a big secret about Wen Bing
in that bag.

194
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,110
If he learned that I lost the bag,
he'll kill me.

195
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,510
If your coach knew about his secret,

196
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,270
I'm afraid Wen Bing
will be kicked out from Liuye.

197
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,590
Alright, I'll help you.

198
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,350
This should be the one.

Captain.

200
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,790
Coach Ma is ridiculous.

201
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,710
She wants us to play the three on
three match with the freshmen this year.

202
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,870
What does she mean?
She's looking down on us?

203
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,430
I don't think it's a bad thing.

204
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,230
The freshmen nowadays are arrogant,

205
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,510
especially Wen Bing.

206
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,550
I think we can use this chance
to let him realize his real capability.

207
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,230
You're right.

208
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,710
Moreover, captain,

209
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,510
please talk to Meng Na about this.

210
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,950
What's wrong with her judgment?
Why did she like Wen Bing?

211

Watch your mouth!

212
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,710
What do you mean,
her judgment is wrong?

213
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,710
The problem now is Wen Bing
keeps pestering Meng Na.

214
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,470
Get the story straight!

215
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,270
Don't be mad, captain.
I don't mean it that way.

216
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,110
Don't worry.

217
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,350
I promise you,
during the three on three match,

218
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,230
every time Wen Bing scores a goal,
you can come and take it out on me.

219
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,350
-Don't forget about your promise.
-I'll keep my words.

220

I'm angry when it comes to Wen Bing.

Who's pestering your sister?

She's as clingy to Wen Bing as a plaster.

224

And you want to crush us
in the three on three match?

uniform and shoe sizes,

328
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,190
When will there be a Ice Hockey
Department for women in Liuye?

329
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,710
[We'll talk about this later.]

330
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,630
Alright, that's all then.

331
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,830
Thank you, principal.

332
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,310
Why isn't Sang Tian here yet?

333
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,590
This...

334
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,300
Coach Ma, you're looking for me?

335
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,030
Everyone is practicing here.

336
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,910
Where did you go?

337
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,640
Coach Ma, didn't you say
I don't need to practice today?

338
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,990
I asked you to rest so that Wen Bing
can practice passing.

339
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,950
Even if you're taking a rest,
you should rest at the waiting area.

340
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,830
How can you be a good class
monitor if you don't even know that?

341
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,870
Why are you standing there?
Hurry up and join the team.

342
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,550
You must all have heard that...

343
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,790
in next week's three on three match,

344
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,350
apart from you freshmen,
the seniors will be joining.

345
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,430
The seniors will join too?

346
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,070
To inspire your fighting spirit,

347
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,510
I've made a decision.

348
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,750
If any of your team can beat the seniors,

349
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,590
I give you my words that
I'll fulfill any one wish...

350
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,790
of every member of that team.

351
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,950
Is that true?

352
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,910
The three of us can do it.

353
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,470
I'll keep my promise.

354
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,670
Anything you ask for.

355
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,830
By the way,

356
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,910
I forgot to mention about your class
monitor during yesterday's review.

357
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,270
Sang Tian.

358
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,870
Yes, Ma'am.

359
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,030
You do have strength.

360
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,390
You're quite agile.

361
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,830
But your shooting technique
is your biggest weakness currently.

362
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,110
I hope that in next week's
three on three match,

363
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,070
you'll show me your improved performance.

364
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,470
I'll definitely work hard.

365
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,630
Alright, hurry up and practice.

366
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,790
Come.

367
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,110
Sang Tian, Coach Ma said,
anything we asked for, mind you.

368
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,510
Why are the two of you not excited at all?

369
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,870
When it comes to strength,

370
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,790
only the three of us are
on par with the seniors.

371
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,590
Sang Tian hasn't agreed...

372
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,630
to this grouping.

373
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,310
Sang Tian, the three
of us are best friends.

374
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,750
You two can't leave me behind.

375
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,870
I didn't say I disagree.

376
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,590
So, you agree?

377
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,150
That's great.

378
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,950
You're so bad, Wen Bing.

379
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,390
If you do that again,

380
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,870
I'll hit you.

381
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,870
Let's go practice.

382
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,270
Class monitor, let's go practice.

383
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,790
What a nice view we have today.

384
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,990
What are you hiding?

385
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,350
[He really hasn't read it.]

386
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,110
[That's great.
Otherwise, it'll be awkward.]

387
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,070
Nothing.

388
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,870
What are you hiding exactly?

389
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,590
I'm not hiding anything.

390
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,710
Look at the view.

391
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,230
It's beautiful, isn't it?

392
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,790
Tell me now...

393
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,110
-or I'll snatch it from you.
-I'll tell you.

394
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,750
I'll tell you.

395
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,150
The cabinet was open, so I closed it.

396
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,430
Is it the red notebook?

397
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,630
What? Are you still trying to court me?

398
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,310
Nope.

399
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,030
Then, why did you take it out?

400
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,510
Did you want to recall the memories
or try something new?

401
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,070
Don't make such a joke again.

402
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,510
Why not?

403
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,430
As I'm a hypocrite and an annoyance
who always act like an oppressive CEO.

404
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,990
What did you say? I didn't hear that.

406
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,230
I said I'm sorry.

407
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,230
That day, I was...

408
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,390
too impulsive.

409
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,670
Actually, you're not that bad.

410
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,070
Not that bad?

411
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,030
That means I'm a little bad?

412
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,870
That's not what I meant.

413
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,350
I meant...

414
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,230
Anyway, it was my fault.

415
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,550
My apologies.

416
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,830
The first ever Oppressive CEO,
Dao Ming Si once said that...

417
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,590
if apologizing helps,

418
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,230
what's the use of police?

419
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,270
Then, what do you want to do?

420
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,910
Buy me oden.

421
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,550
That's it?

422
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,510
Of course.

423
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,470
Alright.

424
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,590
I'll buy you oden for the whole semester.

425
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,790
This semester?

426
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,190
Who knows if you'll leave halfway again?

427
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,070
To prevent you from breaking your words,

428
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,030
let's seal our promise so we have a proof.

429
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,230
A seal?

430
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,190
Come closer.

431
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,910
Come closer.

432
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,710
[He's not going to kiss me, is he?]

433
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,950
What do you mean by this?

434
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,050
Didn't I just say it?

435
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,230
Seal the promise.

436
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,390
It's your turn now.

437
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,990
Hurry up.

438
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,190
Let's continue.

439
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,430
Why do we say Marxist Philosophy is the
world-view and methodology of science?

440
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,950
Let's start with philosophy
and its basic problems.

441
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,470
Firstly,

442
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,910
philosophy is a highly conceptual summary
of human's view of the world...

443
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,710
in the form of theory.

444
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,190
By using a series of unique concepts,
logical argument of category and system...

445
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,140
[Kiss Me Cafe]

446
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,670
Prosopagnosia?

447
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,030
And he can only see you clearly?

448
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,150
How unbelievable.

449
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,110
Tian Tian, are you sure
he didn't lie to you?

450
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,510
I have a question.

451
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,150
Can he not see his face clearly too?

452
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,310
That question hasn't crossed my mind.

453
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,390
If he can't see his face,
will he think himself ugly?

454
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,830
That's impossible, a narcissist like him
must think that he's super handsome.

455
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,590
Is this called blindly confident?

456
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,350
You're right.

457
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,070
But, Tian Tian,

458
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,430
I think you should have some
sense of crisis.

459
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,430
What has it got to do with me?

460
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,710
Think about it.

461
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,870
He's so passionate with you now
because he can see your face.

462
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,710
One day, if he can see everyone's face,
will he still be passionate with you?

463
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,870
I don't care about that.

464
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,070
Furthermore,

465
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,110
the most important thing to me right now
is winning the three on three match...

466
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,990
so Coach Ma will let me stay.

467
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,950
Tian Tian.

468
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,710
Who are you staying for?

469
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,270
You want to be someone's guide dog?

470
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,870
Who are you calling a guide dog?

471
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,270
I'm staying for myself.

472
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,030
Alright, Tian Tian. You're right.

473
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,190
But Coach Ma said that
you're poor in shooting.

474
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,590
You only have a week.
How are you going to break through?

475
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,430
The person in my dorm is the best player.

476
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,790
If I beg him, he'll surely train me.

477
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,790
Senior Wen.

478
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,110
Teacher Wen.

479
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,190
Coach Wen.

480
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,190
Please train me.

481
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,350
I'll agree to any of your conditions.

482
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,790
Any conditions? Are you sure?

483
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,750
Alright.

484
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,470
Help me with this...

485
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,190
and I'll consider about
teaching you when it's done.

486
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,190
Deal. Seal the promise first.

487
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,190
This is my uncle's precious.
You must walk it properly.

488
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,590
Take a 10-minute rest after
every 30 minutes and continue.

489
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,510
Thirty minutes?

490
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,310
It will get tired even if I don't.

491
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,790
How do you know that before trying?

492
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,390
Besides, we walked for 10 km
during our outdoor training.

493
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,230
Did William show his tiredness?

494
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,429
Knock it off.

495
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,070
Do you want to learn
shooting from me or not?

496
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,150
I do.

497
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,110
Go, bring the dog for a walk.

498
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,110
Go now.

499
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,270
Quick!

500
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,310
Hurry up!

501
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,350
Move it!

502
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,389
-The dog is dragging you.
-You...

503
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,030
I...

504
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,550
Teacher Wen.

505
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,750
My throat is on fire.

506
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,510
Can you give me some water?

507
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,830
Fortunately, I was sharp enough.

508
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,710
Why didn't you hold it well?

509
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,790
It'd be a miracle if you can
shoot well with this wrist strength.

510
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,710
I'm warning you.

511
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,350
You must train well today.

512
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,230
Don't show yourself in
front of me before dark.

513
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,070
I've completed everything.
Can you consider to teach me now?

514
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,390
My shoulders are a bit sore.

515
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,470
[I walked the dog for a whole day
but I didn't say anything.]

516
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,830
[You're tired?]

517
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,470
[Forget it.]

518
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,430
[Impatience spoils great plans.]

519
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,710
[In order to stay in Liuye,]

520
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,190
[I'll endure it.]

521
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,470
Alright.

522
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,110
Teacher Wen.

523
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,150
Where do you feel sore? Tell me.

524
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,510
I'll help you massage.

525
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,830
[Hypocrite.]

526
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,870
[Egomania.]

527
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,110
[Two-faced guy.]

528
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,510
[Pretender.]

529
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,630
Did I hurt you?

530
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,430
Come over.

531
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,230
What's the matter?

532
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,350
Did you just show your concern to me?

533
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,390
No, I didn't.

534
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,390
I'm worried that you wouldn't
want to teach me if I hurt you.

535
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,590
Since when did I agree to teach you?

536
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,830
Don't act dumb. I've walked the dog.

537
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,950
You must keep your promise.

538
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,790
Did you lose your memories?
What did I say before we leave?

539
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,790
You said when I've completed the task,
you'll consider to teach me.

540
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,830
-Right?
-Yes, I'm considering now.

541
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,710
When I have an answer, I'll let you know.

542
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,830
You jerk!

543
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,070
I'll practice myself
if you won't teach me.

544
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,350
Who cares?

545
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,030
Feel that.

546
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,750
Nice one.

547
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,870
Did his nasty face bring
out the fighting spirit in me?

548
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,070
Could it be that...

549
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,590
he asked me to walk the dog
and massaged him yesterday...

550
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,310
to strengthen my wrist?

551
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,230
So, he's started training me already,

552
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,670
but I didn't realize it.

553
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,070
Oh, no!

554
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,510
The toothpaste!

555
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,470
Sang Tian!

556
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,510
Hurry up and answer.

557
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,270
The wasabi flavored toothpaste
is really something.

558
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,750
No.

559
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,070
What are you doing here?

560
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,910
Didn't you want me to train you?

561
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,630
Happiness came too soon.
I thought you won't be coming.

562
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,430
My shoulder hurts.

563
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,510
My waist hurts too.

564
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,710
No, don't look!

565
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,110
Could you please use
a more handsome photo next time?

566
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,070
That's not the right thing to say.

567
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,470
Teacher Wen looks handsome in every photo.
I like every one of it.

568
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,390
You're simply everyone's dream man.

569
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,350
Knock it off.

570
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,870
Hurry up and practice.

571
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,990
Stop.

572
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,830
Your major problem is not your wrist,

573
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,790
but you need to continue practicing
these few days.

574
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,870
Secondly, it's your shooting position.

575
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,400
Come.

576
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,190
Shooting position.

577
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,430
Hold it well.

578
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,630
First, do that.

579
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,030
-Hold on to the hockey stick.
-[Sang Tian, why are you shy?]

580
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,350
[He's just teaching you to shoot.]

581
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,630
[You must focus.]
