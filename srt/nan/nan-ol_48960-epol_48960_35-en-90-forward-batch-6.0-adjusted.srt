[Episode 35]

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,260
I didn't expect the karmic mother bugs we've been searching

5
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,660
for such a long time are in the Royal Palace.

6
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,579
It saves me some trouble.

7
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,920
Father.

8
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,950
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

9
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,410
The pattern on the tattooed cyan human skin

10
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,500
is completely different from the map of the Royal Palace.

11
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,060
In the early stage of the Great Xi Dynasty,

12
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,180
the palace of the previous dynasty was still used.

13
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,260
So it has been expanded and renovated many times over the past century.

14
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,320
The current palace

15
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,780
is indeed very different from what it was a hundred years ago.

16
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,280
So this human skin means

17
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,540
the mother bugs are in the Royal Palace.

18
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,810
If so,

19
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:55,400
Shan Gudao's target must be the Royal Palace, too.

20
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,860
I have the royal blood

21
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,840
of Nanyin's and the present dynasty's imperial family.

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,570
What I want is

23
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,980
something that's supposed to be mine in the first place.

24
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,980
Could his searching for karmic bugs

25
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,510
be with the aim of killing His Majesty?

26
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,510
Lord Fang.

27
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,650
Could you please report to His Majesty

28
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,830
and ask Imperial City Division to make sure the palace is heavily guarded?

29
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,330
This...

30
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,880
Mr. Li.

31
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,329
Without solid evidence,

32
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,310
His Majesty won't believe it.

33
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,260
His Majesty will even be mad

34
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,230
and consider it as a rumor instead.

35
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,820
Something like this happened many years ago.

36
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,180
It caused a great fuss in the whole country.

37
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,990
But it turned out to be nothing after investigation.

38
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,190
But this is a big deal.

39
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,350
Is there no other way?

40
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,140
I know someone from the Imperial City Division.

41
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,470
I can only write a letter to the Imperial City Division in private,

42
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,730
and ask them to keep an eye on it secretly.

43
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,860
Lord Fang.

44
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,450
Is there a way you can send me into the palace?

45
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,120
I must find the karmic mother bugs

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,380
before Shan Gudao does

47
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,390
and stop him.

48
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,870
Young Master.

49
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,310
Has the spy found out

50
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,610
what I asked him to investigate the other day?

51
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,540
The spy is back.

52
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,630
The Styx Flower can indeed help people rebuild their body

53
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,560
and have all poisons detoxicated.

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,830
In that case,

55
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,940
Li Lianhua can be saved.

56
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,930
According to the spy,

57
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,380
there are two kinds of leaves on one Styx Flower, Yin and Yang.

58
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,899
The Yin leaf can repair the meridians,

59
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,380
which can fill the body with Genuine Qi instantly,

60
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,100
but the person will die due to organ explosion very soon.

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,790
Only if the person eats Yin and Yang leaves together can he be saved.

62
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,360
Eating Yin and Yang leaves together?

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,890
Besides,

64
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,730
the Jinyuan Alliance has also been looking for the whereabouts of the Styx Flower.

65
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,900
Because the Yang leaf of the Styx Flower is extremely masculine and strong,

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,580
which exactly matches

67
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,780
the Windy Poplar Di Feisheng has been practicing.

68
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,240
Di Feisheng wants to use the Yang leaf

69
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,460
to break through the highest level of Windy Poplar.

70
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,320
Di Feisheng...

71
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,310
So have you found the whereabouts of the Styx Flower?

72
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,210
Mr. Li.

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,100
Xiaobao asked us to make sure

74
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,960
you stay in Tianji Mountain Manor

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,190
and wait for him to find the medicine for you.

76
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,920
He also asked us to tell you that

77
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,020
there's nothing in this world that can't be done without you.

78
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,900
So you must keep yourself alive.

79
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,970
Do you know

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
where he went?

81
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,180
He only said

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,910
he went to find the medicine for you.

83
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,730
We don't know

84
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,370
where he went exactly.

85
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,180
Mr. Li.

86
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,900
Fang Xiaobao knows what he's doing.

87
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,930
Just stay here and wait for him to come back.

88
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,190
I appreciate your kindness.

89
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,020
But this is an emergency.

90
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,900
I need to go to the capital immediately.

91
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,820
I'm afraid

92
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,409
Fang Xiaobao will blame you.

93
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,470
I'll explain to him

94
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,980
later.

95
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,960
Mr. Li.

96
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,420
I know

97
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
people like you

98
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,580
have their own persistence and choices.

99
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,900
Even if Tianji Mountain Manor forces you

100
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,140
to stay today,

101
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,970
the matter in your heart is unsolved,

102
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,510
and the burden is still on your shoulders.

103
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,460
You will blame yourself downheartedly

104
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,690
and regret in the future.

105
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,670
I, He Xiaohui, hate to see heroes regret what they fail to achieve.

106
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,430
So, I won't stop you.

107
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,420
Thank you.

108
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,660
Lord Fang.

109
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,640
How is the thing I requested before going?

110
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,290
Alright.

111
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,620
I'll send a letter to my subordinates in the capital.

112
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,830
There will be someone making arrangements for you

113
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,260
when you arrive in the capital.

114
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,320
Thank you, My Lord.

115
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,700
I have official duties I need to fulfill.

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,780
I can't go to the capital for now

117
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,370
without the imperial order.

118
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:26,970
Mr. Li.

119
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,310
Be careful.

120
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,580
Mr. Li.

121
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,620
Don't worry.

122
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,450
Tianji Mountain Manor will never

123
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,470
reveal your identity.

124
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,620
Goodbye.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,510
Li.

126
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,190
I'll see you off.

127
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,860
No need.

128
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,610
See you.

129
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,940
Cheer up.

130
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,490
No mistake is allowed in the Sword Room.

131
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,020
Yes.

132
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,960
Stop fighting.

133
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,740
You've made it in here.

134
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,630
It means you are quite capable.

135
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,910
You are indeed my son.

136
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,980
It may be easy to get in the Wansheng Clan,

137
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,160
but it'll be extra difficult

138
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,580
if you want to get out.

139
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,560
Don't stand there.

140
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,530
Sit down and have a drink with me.

141
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,260
So you want the Styx Flower

142
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,390
to save Li Xiangyi?

143
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,730
You used to be close fellow apprentices.

144
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,740
You used to practice martial arts

145
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,580
and travel the martial world together.

146
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,980
How could you put him in the ground

147
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,460
for your own ambition?

148
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,400
Ambition?

149
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,460
Everything should be mine in the first place.

150
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,220
But you

151
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,840
called it ambition.

152
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,740
Back then,

153
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,770
Li Xiangyi always wanted to oppress me.

154
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,680
And now,

155
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,310
even my own son

156
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,300
takes his side.

157
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,860
Just for these illusory things,

158
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,750
you'd rather drive your fellows of Sigu Sect up the wall,

159
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,150
kill your own master,

160
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,280
instigate dissension and disrupt this peaceful and prosperous world?

161
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,280
What does this peaceful and prosperous world have to do with me?

162
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,520
What I want

163
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,690
is a peaceful and prosperous world that belongs to me, Shan Gudao.

164
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,170
And you. You are my own son.

165
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,840
You have my blood.

166
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,100
I hope you can join me

167
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,700
in this ambitious cause.

168
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,330
Everything that I have in the future

169
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,980
will be yours.

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,780
I don't agree with what you do.

171
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,440
And I won't stand by your side.

172
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,910
But you

173
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,970
are always my biological father.

174
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,820
I owe you my life.

175
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,490
This toast

176
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:15,980
is to you.

177
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,930
After I kowtow to you today,

178
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,560
your kindness will be repaid.

179
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,370
From now on,

180
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,270
we'll owe each other nothing.

181
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,630
Good.

182
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,500
Since you are so heartless,

183
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,520
don't blame me.

184
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,500
There won't be anything I can't bear to do.

185
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,360
Master.

186
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,590
You learned the Qianjun Guiyuan Formation

187
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,920
from Qi Mushan, and you perfected it.

188
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,180
No one has made it out alive.

189
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,520
This is his own choice.

190
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,910
He's my only family in the world.

191
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,420
I've always been thinking of this.

192
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,480
But what about him?

193
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,950
Not only does he side with outsiders,

194
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,010
but he also goes against me all along.

195
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,410
If he can't make it out of this formation,

196
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
it's fate.

197
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,970
I'm not the one to blame.

198
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,760
What is this place?

199
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,480
Since this formation has such a clever design,

200
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,800
it must be controlled by a mechanism.

201
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,660
I must find the core of the mechanism as soon as possible

202
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,390
and defeat the hallucination.

203
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,260
That's right.

204
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
It's hallucination.

205
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
Bravo!

[Nanshan Hall]

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,700
I heard that they hired

208
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,830
a famous miracle-working physician.

209
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,430
He can cure any disease.

You bet.

211
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,160
I have a distant brother

working as a cook in Tiejia Sect.

213
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Their young master died,

214
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,220
and this miracle-working physician resurrected him.

215

Yes.

Physician Li.

223

Minister Fang has ordered me to spread the word

to promote your medical skills in the capital, Physician Li.

225
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,260
You've really impressed the whole capital these days.

226

I believe there will be news from the imperial palace soon.

227

We're approaching the inner palace.

We're not far from the Noble Lady's palace.

When we arrive,

you'll join the consultation for the Noble Lady with the other doctors.

Everyone.

240

This is

241
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,710
Physician Li, who has been famous in the capital recently.

242
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,790
Nice to meet you.

243
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,420
Nice to meet you.

244
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,330
Please wait a little longer.

245
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,380
When the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei arrives,

246
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,640
you can go in together for consultation.

247
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,570
Eunuch Wang,

248
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,350
may I ask who the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei is,

249
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,240
and why we are waiting for him?

250
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,020
The Imperial Preceptor of Xibei is highly skilled in occult practices.

251
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,460
He's highly respected by the Empress Dowager.

252
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,820
He finally made a visit to Great Xi.

253
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,480
Of course, he's our guest.

254
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,580
It's our honor to have a consultation with the Imperial Preceptor

255
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
for the Noble Lady's treatment.

256
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,570

It's Demon Monk.

Shan Gudao is eager to find the karmic mother bugs.

260

It seems that the mother bugs are indeed inside the Royal Palace.

262

272
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,900
Imperial Preceptor, there may be some misunderstanding.

273
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,750
Physician Li is a famous miracle-working physician in the capital.

274
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,500
The Empress Dowager issued an order to invite him here.

275
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,850
His name is Li Lianhua.

276
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,860
He's been conning people in the name of miracle-working physician

You want me to have the consultation with him today.

279
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,230
Are you looking down on me

280
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,530
or the State of Xibei?

281
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,450
Why does the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei from so far away

282
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,880
care so much about a wandering physician?

284
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,380
Have you checked his pass?

285
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,300
Can you check it carefully?

286
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,360
Both of you

287
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,800
are distinguished guests invited by Empress Dowager.

288
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,790
If there's any grudge from the past,

289
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,220
could you please put it on hold for the moment,

290
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
for the sake of Empress Dowager?

291
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,560
Treating the Noble Lady is more important.

292
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,930
There's no way I'll have the consultation

293

If he stays,

295
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,630
I shall take my leave.

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,770
why don't we

301
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,190
make a bet to see

302
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480
who's going to be the one to stay?

303
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
What do you think?

304
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,720
What do you want to bet on?

305
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,480
Imperial Preceptor, you're also here to treat the Noble Lady.

306
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,110
Why don't we bet on

307
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,590
who can cure the Noble Lady's illness?

308
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,690
Make the bet as you wish.

309
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,790
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

310
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,930
But if you lose,

311
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,510
you'll have committed another felony,

312
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,730
which is disrespecting foreign envoys.

Please be patient, Imperial Preceptor.

320

What the Noble Lady has is a strange illness.

No, you can't do that.

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,800
Come in.

341
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,400
Li Lianhua.

342
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,610
It's really you.

343
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,690
Why are you here?

344
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,310
Your Highness, long time no see.

345
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,510
I'm here to treat you.

346
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,030
Grandmother tells everyone that a Noble Lady is sick.

347
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,290
How do you know it's me?

348
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,680
I couldn't tell and didn't know it before.

349
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,800
However,

350
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,870
I saw the character "Zhao" outside the palace,

351
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,080
so I figured it out.

352
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,060
Your Highness, why do you pretend to be sick?

353
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,260
It's all because of Fang Duobing.

354
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,920
So the reason why you pretend to be sick

355
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,750
and refuse to see the doctor

356
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,590
is to ask for Empress Dowager's permission

357
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,220
to go out and find Fang Xiaobao, right?

358
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,850
You're still so smart.

359
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,710
You got it right at first attempt.

360
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,010
Unfortunately, Grandmother wouldn't allow me.

361
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,810
Instead, she invited a lot of famous physicians here.

362
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,780
Another one came once I beat one away.

363
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm about to give up.

364
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,520
Luckily, you're here, Li Lianhua.

365
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,770
Go and tell them

366
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,620
that I need to go out of the palace for treatment.

367
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,180
Let’s go find Fang Duobing immediately.

368
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,980
Your Highness, there's no rush.

369
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,970
I came to the palace this time

370
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
for something important,

371
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,230
so I can't leave for the time being.

372
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,230
For case investigation?

373
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,840
Smart.

374
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,420
Recently,

375
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,980
some bandits have managed to sneak

376
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,600
into the palace.

377
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,880
I must catch them.

378
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,680
She's cured. Come in.

379
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,700
Your Highness.

380
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,050
Eunuch Wang.

381
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,740
Physician Li has cured my illness.

382
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,430
I have a good appetite.

383
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,590
Tell the kitchen to cook more food.

384
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,350
As long as you're healthy, Your Highness.

385
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,550
I'll go get ready.

386
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,940
And I'll report it to Her Majesty.

387
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,310
She must be happy.

388
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,490
Wait.

389
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,690
Your Highness, what else can I do for you?

390
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,830
I heard that someone bullied Physician Li.

391
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,150
I'm stupid.

392
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,620
I didn't know the one who was sick is Your Highness.

393
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,560
Sorry for my reckless behavior.

394
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,360
I didn't mean to bully Li Lianhua.

395
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,980
I just had a bet with him.

396
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,590
Please don't misunderstand, Your Highness.

397
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,530
A bet?

398
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,630
What's the bet?

399
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,200
I bet with him that

400
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,840
if one of us cured you first,

401
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,340
the other one

402
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,470
must leave the palace.

403
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,370
Then why haven't you left the palace yet, Imperial Preceptor?

404
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,830
Eunuch Wang.

405
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,190
Send the Imperial Preceptor out of the palace.

406
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,610
Who wants to drive my benefactor away?

407
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,040
-Your Majesty./N-Grandmother.

408
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,740
Grandmother.

409
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,420
Grandmother.

410
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,740
Your leg has recovered.

411
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,320
Thanks to the elixir Imperial Preceptor brought me from the Blood Realm.

412
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,460
I've been lying in bed

413
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,100
for four or five years.

414
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,100
Finally, I can come down and take a walk.

417

Are you cured?

418
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,220
Yes.

419
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,320
Physician Li cured me.

420
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,860
Then why do you have to drive Imperial Preceptor away?

421
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,100
It's not that I wanted to drive him away.

422
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,740
He lost the bet himself.

423
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,320
A bet is a bet.

424
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,530
He's not a shameless dog.

425
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,340
Of course he has to go.

426
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Your Majesty.

427
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,730
I shall take my leave.

428
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,550
Not so fast, Imperial Preceptor.

429
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,540
You must be Mr. Li.

430
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,070
Your Majesty.

431
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Rise, please.

432
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,030
Zhaoling has been ill for more than a month.

433
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,430
Thanks to Mr. Li, she's cured.

434
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,780
I thank you on behalf of His Majesty.

435
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,720
You're welcome, Your Majesty.

436
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,590
As a doctor,

437
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,610
I just tried my best and did what I should do.

438
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,230
You're kind and skillful.

439
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,770
Both of you

440
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,830
are my benefactors.

441
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,510
I haven't repaid your kindness yet.

442
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,680
How can we say goodbye in such a hurry?

443
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,060
I hope you

444
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,730
can let go of the bet

445

It was just a bet with the Imperial Preceptor.

Don't worry about it.

449

Right.

450
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,230
I would ask the Imperial Preceptor to stay too.

Mr. Li and Imperial Preceptor, you are both invited.

Please don't refuse.

It's my great honor.

Thank you, Your Majesty.

458
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,240
Your Majesty. It's just that

459
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,370
it'll take some time

460
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,570
before Her Highness can be fully recovered.

461
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,420
I need to take Her Highness

462
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,930
to a place that's airy and ventilated in the palace

463
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,210
so that her meridians can be cleared.

464
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,190
Hope I can get your permission, Your Majesty.

465

Yes, Grandmother.

I still have a bit of a headache.

467

In that case,

468
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,280
we'll do as you say.

469

473
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,590
You said the Imperial Preceptor is a bad person.

474
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,690
Then why did he cure Grandmother's leg?

475
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,270
There's something magical called Golden Shell Snow Silkworm in the State of Xibei.

476
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,600
It can fix broken limbs.

477
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,580
It is said to be a rare treasure.

478
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,680
I guess the Imperial Preceptor

479
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,050
used this Snow Silkworm

480
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,540
to cure Empress Dowager.

481
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,300
What do they want to steal exactly?

482
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,500
Even at the cost of a national treasure.

483
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,610
The Interior Treasury?

484
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,970
Grandmother always says the
expenses of the royal family

485
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,420
come from the Interior Treasury.

486
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,080

You winked at me and asked me to come out here.

490
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,810
You've figured out how to catch them, right?

492

I'll take you to look around the palace.

I didn't mistake this knife as a hallucination.

509
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,810
What a formation of fake and real.

510
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,240
Could this be

511
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,530
Dian Daoke's Demon-Spike Sword?

512
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,850
Li Lianhua.

513
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,210
Is that symbol reliable?

514
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,080
We've searched the entire palace.

515
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,480
Is there no other clue?

516
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,950
It seems that

517
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,640
there is no other clue for now.

518
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,930
But, Your Highness,

519
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,860
did you notice anyone who's been acting weird

520
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,380
in the palace?

521
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,280
That evil old man, Xuanyuan Xiao.

522
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,270
What's wrong with him?

523
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,300
He is the Commander of the Imperial City Division.

524
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,690
A few days ago, he suddenly started a thorough check in the palace.

525
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,320
Those whose background is unclear had to leave the palace.

526
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,420
Many of my handmaidens were kicked out.

527
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,820
He seems weird to me.

528
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,370
Could it be Xuanyuan Xiao?

529
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,290
He's just being a little strict.

530
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,470
It's not a problem.

531
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,870
Nothing matches.

532
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,380
The sun is setting.

533
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,630
I'm so tired.

534
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,900
Your Highness.

535
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,870
It's getting late.

536
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,420
Why don't you go back and rest?

537
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,630
OK.

538
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,060
Take this.

539
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,530
If you get in trouble,

540
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,080
take it to Yuhua Gate and find the Head Guard, Dian Qiu.

541
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,010
He's a trusted aide from my hometown. He'll help you.

542
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,980
I'm leaving then.

543
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,310
See you, Your Highness.

544
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,210
Minister Fang's reminder worked.

545
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,860
There must have been many of

546
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,940
Shan Gudao's spies in those who were kicked out of the palace.

547
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,620
That's why he could only ask Demon Monk

548
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,740
to enter the palace as Imperial Preceptor.

549
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,110
[Diecui Pavilion]

550
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,200
Mr. Li, long time no see.

551
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,850
You've only been wandering among the folks.

552
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,700
I didn't expect to see you here.

553
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,820
Lord Yang.

554
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,500
So you've heard

555
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,790
my conversation with Her Highness just now.

556
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,120
There's another reason

557
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,780
why I entered the palace this time.

558
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,370
But the Imperial City Division

559
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,030
has already known the reason.

560
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,640
So the warning we received

561
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,990
was from you, Mr. Li.

562
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,240
Shan Gudao has got his hands into the Royal Palace.

563
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,980
I have to come here and take care of it myself.

564
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,840
But, Lord Yang,

565
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,940
you work for the Supervision Bureau.

566
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,040
Why are you here?

567
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,960
My master is the Commander of the Imperial City Division.

568
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,560
He appointed me to the Imperial City Division a few days ago

569
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,960
because of your warning.

570
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,370
The suspects should have been sent out of the palace.

571
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,570
We should be safe now.

572
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,620
The Imperial City Division

573
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,080
has cleared up many spies,

574
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,610
but they let in such a big trouble.

575
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,940
The State of Xibei

576
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,270
has been coveting

577
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,740
Great Xi's territory for long.

578
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,040
So the aim of the Demon Monk entering the palace

579
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,860
is very clear.

580
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,910
What he wants must be related to our territory.

581
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,640
Please remind your master again, Lord Yang.

582
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,950
No need.

583
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,110
Master.

584
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,550
Master.

585
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,820
We are master and disciple in private.

586
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,560
[Commander of the Imperial City Division, Xuanyuan Xiao]

587
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,100
But now we're performing our duty in the palace.

588
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,440
Yes.

589
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,420
Greetings, Commander.

590
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,130
There are always dangers and threats in the palace.

591
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,890
If we suspect everything,

592
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,920
I'm afraid the Imperial City Division would have been executed for encroachment.

593
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,870
Unexpectedly,

594
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,740
the Imperial City Division

595
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,870
neglected its duty.

596
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,260
You knew the danger was near,

597
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,090
but you'd rather ignore it.

598
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,460
I spoke too much.

599
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,610
You worry too much, Mr. Li.

600
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,890
No matter what the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei's purpose is,

601
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,830
as long as he doesn't break the rules,

602
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,760
he is still the Imperial Preceptor

603
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,710
and His Majesty's guest.

604
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,770
Just like you, Mr. Li.

605
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,120
You entered the palace to treat illness.

606
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,750
Just perform your duty as a physician.

607
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,080
Mind your own business.

608
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,460
The defense in the palace is strong and solid.

609
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
Everything is under my control.

610
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,380
It's none of your business, quack.

611
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,540
Yunchun.

612
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,100
Send Mr. Li back to his room to rest.

613
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,810
My Lord.

614
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,610
Do you remember the Mid-Autumn night in the Royal Palace ten years ago?

615
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,340
It's really beautiful.

616
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,310
Who are you? How dare you break into the Royal Palace?

617
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,380
The Epiphyllum Festival really deserves its reputation.

618
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,580
I shall take my leave.

619
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,260
So you were the one who broke into the Royal Palace that night.

620
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,460
The man in control behind the Imperial Preceptor of Xibei

621
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,470
is Shan Gudao, from the Wansheng Clan.

622
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,770
He's the master of the powerful Wansheng Clan.

623
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,230
My Lord.

624
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,500
If you strike only after he has struck,

625
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,810
you'll be at a disadvantage.

626
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,100
So you are Li Xiangyi.

627
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,890
Although I haven't left the palace for decades,

628
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,280
I've heard of your name.

629
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,120
You died ten years ago.

630
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,950
After coming back to life ten years later,

631
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,750
you only knew to come in the palace and slander the Wansheng Clan and Shan Gudao.

632
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,950
What's your purpose?

633
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,060
It seems the rumors about you are true.

634
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,390
Wansheng Clan has been loyal these years,

635
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,050
working for the Imperial Court.

636
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:22,010
Shan Gudao once saved the Xuanyuan family.

637
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,280
He's a righteous man.

638
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,090
But you.

639
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,660
You tried to assassinate him and made him hide for ten years,

640
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,720
and now you're slandering him again.

641
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,440
Considering that you're the Empress Dowager's guest,

642
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,370
I won't kill you.

643
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,860
Don't let me get the goods on you.

644
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,050
Or there will be

645
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,900
a vacancy for you

646
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,320
in the prison of Imperial City Division, Sect Leader Li.

647
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,080
Even a master like Xuanyuan Xiao has been bribed.

648
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,210
Senior's game is set so deliberately.

649
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,980
Looks like there's only one way to stop him.

650
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,860
Tomorrow at the banquet,

651
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,900
I have to gain His Majesty's trust.

652
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,770
This is a family banquet to thank the Imperial Preceptor and Mr. Li.

653
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,480
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

654
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,140
Just drink as much as you want.

655
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,130
[Emperor of Great Xi]

656
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,060
Your Majesty.

657
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,409
The State of Great Xi

658
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,090
is beautiful and prosperous.

659
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,139
There are so many talented people here.

660
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,679
Not to mention how advantaged and talented you are, Your Majesty.

661
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,190
My first toast today

662
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,389
has to go to Your Majesty.

663
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,460
This is my blessing,

664
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,860
not my credit.

665
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,980
Thank you for your praise, Imperial Preceptor.

666
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,909
To Your Majesty.

667
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,940
My second toast is to the Empress Dowager.

668
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,790
Congratulations on the three blessings, Your Majesty.

669
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,940
Zhaoling and I are cured, which counts as two blessings.

670
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,590
What's the third blessing?

671
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,150
Half a month ago,

672
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,670
I discussed with Empress Dowager

673
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,270
about building an occult pagoda in the palace.

674
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,880
Everything is ready now.

675
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,980
As long as Your Majesty and Empress Dowager agree,

676
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,580
we can start the site selection and building of the pagoda today.

677
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,760
Mother, why do you suddenly want to build an occult pagoda?

678
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,610
I'm just imitating

679
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,350
the tradition of Emperor Guangqing

680
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,550
and trying to pray for more blessings to the royal family.

681
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,320
There's no record of

682
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,700
Emperor Guangqing building an occult pagoda

683
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,560
before giving birth to his child.

684
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,330
And there's no former site of an occult pagoda.

685
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,220
It's probably just a legend.

686
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,110
Mother.

687
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,800
Don't take it seriously.

688
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,150
Since it's a legend,

689
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,450
it could be true.

690
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,030
Although you're still in your prime, Your Majesty,

691
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,630
you only have a daughter, Zhaoling.

692
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,070
It's a big problem if the royal family has no male offspring.

693
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,150
How can I not be worried?

694
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,350
Fine.

695
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,690
Let's do it as you wish, Mother.

696
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,150
Order.

697
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,630
Order!

698
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,160
Occult pagoda craftsmen, come in the hall!

699
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

700
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,050
Rise.

701
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

702
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,860
Your Majesty.

703
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,860
This is the occult pagoda blueprint drawn by the craftsmen from Lanzhu.

704
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,720
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

705
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,530
It is indeed an audacious pagoda that seems appropriate and harmonious.

706
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,480
So you are the craftsmen recommended by the Imperial Preceptor?

707
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,440
Why do you

708
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,300
look a bit familiar to me?

709
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,100
Your Majesty.

710
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,490
I am Feng Pan, from Wansheng Clan.

711
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,780
I donated some money and grains during the famine in Longxi.

712
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,240
I was lucky to have been summoned and rewarded by Your Majesty.

713
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,120
Your Majesty.

714
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,220
These are the craftsmen Imperial Perceptor asked me to hire from Lanzhu

715
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,070
with big money.

716
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,900
I'm sure Your Majesty and Empress Dowager will be satisfied.

717
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,150
No wonder you look so kind.

718
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,180
You're a hero of Great Xi.

719
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,750
In that case,

720
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,530
you can select an idle spot

721
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,490
in the palace to build the pagoda.

722
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,910
So this is Shan Gudao's plan.

723
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,590
In the name of building a pagoda for a royal offspring,

724
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,250
he can take this opportunity to look for mother bugs in the palace.

725
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,740
Your Majesty.

726
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,220
I think it's a bit inappropriate.

727
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,660
What matters the most in the Royal Palace

728
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,850
is royal authority.

729
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,860
Wouldn't building the occult pagoda be turning the tables?

730
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,220
Besides, if this occult pagoda

731
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,620
is built outside the palace wall,

732
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,500
it would be more appropriate.

733
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,540
The space is vast.

734
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,290
Why does it have to be built inside the palace?

735
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,570
What Mr. Li said

736
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,180
makes sense too.

737
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,130
Your Majesty.

738
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,710
It's okay if we are building an ordinary occult pagoda.

739
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,700
But the occult pagoda we are building will have Luminous Sarira stored in it,

740
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,830
so it has to be built inside the palace.

741
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,550
Luminous Sarira?

742
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,880
The Luminous Sarira stolen during the late emperor's reign?

743
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,210
Exactly, Your Majesty.

744
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,940
We bought this treasure with a lot of money

745
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,040
from the State of Lanzhu.

746
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,720
We know how important it is,

747
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,650
so we brought it here to present to you, Your Majesty.

748
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,640
Bring it to me.

749
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,440
What is this treasure?

750
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,040
Why are you so happy, Father?

751
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,320
This is the treasure that the late emperor valued the most.

752
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
When it was placed in the palace,

753
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,490
Great Xi was prosperous and free of famine and plague for ten years.

754
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,650
This treasure is heavily blessed.

755
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,290
If it's placed in the pagoda built inside the palace,

756
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,420
it will protect the state and the people of Great Xi

757
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,150
just like it did during the late emperor's reign.

758
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,060
The late emperor was heartbroken

759
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,830
when this treasure was stolen.

760
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,940
It's a good omen

761
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,710
that it comes back to us today.

762
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,700
Fine.

763
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,960
I permit you to walk around the palace and select a site

764
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,860
to build the audacious pagoda right away.

765
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,790
Place this treasure in the pagoda.

766
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,780
We won't let Your Majesty and Empress Dowager down.

767
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,610
This is so great.

768
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,980
Your Majesty.

769
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,780
The site selection and building of the pagoda is extraordinarily mysterious.

770
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,240
If there are too many people involved,

771
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,300
it may disturb the spiritual energy.

772
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,340
Physician Li is a distinguished guest.

773
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,490
Please allow him

774
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,930
to stay in a guest room outside the palace, Your Majesty.

775
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,920
Your Majesty, I know some occult practices.

776
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,880
Isn't it perfect if I help

777
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,960
the Imperial Preceptor with site selection?

778
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,090
Maybe I don't have to

779
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,100
leave the palace.

780
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,050
Physician Li just said

781
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,180
it's inappropriate to build a pagoda inside the palace.

782
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,510
And now you say this.

783
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,260
I'm afraid you're fooling His Majesty.

784
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,180
Of course I dare not fool His Majesty.

785
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,970
But I really want to help.

786
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,090
Imperial Preceptor is a guest from another country,

787
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,550
yet he thinks for Your Majesty so sincerely.

788
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,020
As a citizen of Great Xi,

789
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,840
of course I should do my part.

790
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,670
Mr. Li.

791
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,260
Since you dared to talk so ambitiously in front of His Majesty,

792
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,750
I'm sure you have a deep understanding

793
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,830
of metaphysics.

794
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,050
How about this?

795
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,230
Use your metaphysics to divine

796
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,480
how many jade beads there are

797
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,640
in my sachet.

798
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,530
I believe this kind of trick

799
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,950
is a piece of cake to you.

800
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,010
Why does he have to listen to you?

801
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,010
Giving orders in front of my father.

802
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,110
How rude!

803
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,020
It's okay.

804
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,560
It's not a big deal, divining the number.

805
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,780
However,

806
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,770
occult practices are psychic.

807
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,440
Isn't it a blasphemy

808
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,810
if I use it to divine the number of jade beads?

809
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,530
How about

810
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,910
I use it to divine something bigger

811
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,290
to show my real ability?

812
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,710
May I

813
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,990
divine and see

814
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,350
if there's anything bothering you lately, Your Majesty?

815
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,800
OK.

816
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,770
Mr. Li, please start your divination.

817
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,620
My way of divination is different.

818
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,060
It's called Picking-flower Hexagram.

819
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,280
Please pick any flower you like, Your Majesty.

820
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,890
The flower you picked

821
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,420
is yet to bloom.

822
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,540
It shows that it needs water.

823
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,390
What's been bothering Your Majesty

824
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,760
is related to water.

825
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,870
There's a drought in Yuzhou.

826
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,170
His Majesty has been worried about it for days.

827
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,400
Everyone knows that.

828
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,280
What Physician Li said

829
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,470
is just a common hoax.

830
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,670
That's just the beginning.

831
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,540
I haven't finished yet.

832
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,660
Please take a look.

833
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
The pistil in the bud has taken form.

834
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,780
It will bloom very soon today.

835
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,490
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

836
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,750
The matter you've been worried about is about to be solved.

837
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,120
Report!

838
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,340
Your Majesty.

839
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,690
Urgent news from Yuzhou.

840
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,320
Yesterday, it finally rained.

841
