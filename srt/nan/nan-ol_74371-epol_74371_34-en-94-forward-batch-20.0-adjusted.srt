[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

4
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,150
Father, Mother.

5
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,400
Yu is back.

6
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,710
Yu. My dear Yu.

7
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,789
-Mother.
-You're finally back.

8
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,560
It was with great difficulty that
I gained the Empress Dowager's pity

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,840
and was granted the chance
to leave the palace,

10
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,759
so I cannot stay for long.

11
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,740
I have important matters
to discuss with Father.

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,830
Mother, please return to your room
and rest.

13
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,180
I want to stay with you, Yu.

14
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,020
Yan,

15
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,450
escort your mother back.

16
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,490
I'll wait for you outside.

17
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,580
Mother.

18
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,220
This is a letter from the Empress
to her brother, General Zhao.

19
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,290
Please deliver it to the Northern Army
as soon as possible, Father.

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,800
What exactly happened?

21
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,050
The Crown Prince was eager
to defend his mother

22
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,050
and ended up offending His Majesty.

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,079
Father.

24
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,380
Okay.

25
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,740
I'll send your brother
to deliver it immediately.

26
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,670
The Empress said

27
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,990
we must first ensure
the Crown Prince's safety

28
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,710
before planning our next move.

29
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,370
I understand what's at stake.

30
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,720
I'll return to the palace now.

31
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,270
Yu.

32
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,150
Must you really
accompany the Crown Prince

33
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,010
during his confinement
in the Imperial Clan Court?

34
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,870
Wherever he is,

35
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,460
that's where I'll be.

36
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:17,900
Alright.

37
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,990
You may leave.

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,280
Once everything is arranged,

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,520
I will send someone

40
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,490
to deliver the message to you.

41
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,780
I, Yu,

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,270
thank you, Father.

43
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,670
Farewell, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,670
Sui.

45
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you still afraid of your father,
His Majesty?

46
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,950
Then can you tell me

47
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,480
what you're worried about?

48
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,640
Father is very angry.

49
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,670
Will Mother and Che die?

50
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,040
Here.

51
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,990
Sui, don't worry.

52
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,110
Her Majesty and His Highness
just did something wrong,

53
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,270
and His Majesty only deposed them

54
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,870
from the position of Empress
and Crown Prince.

55
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,110
If only people didn't have to die.

56
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,990
Once they die,

57
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,890
they can't speak

58
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,620
or move anymore,

59
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,260
just like my mother.

60
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,380
Consort Jin was a fairy from heaven.

61
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,350
Now that you've grown up,

62
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,940
of course she had to return.

63
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,740
The dead cannot come back to life,

64
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,490
nor do they return to heaven.

65
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,420
Wan, you don't have to comfort me
with lies.

66
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,740
Sui...

67
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,650
Little Wan'er!

68
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,230
Why has Che been confined
in the Imperial Clan Court?

69
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,409
Such a refined person as he is,

70
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:08,610
how could he have behaved improperly
before His Majesty?

71
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,180
That's not something we should discuss.

72
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,990
Right, right.

73
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,990
It's none of our business,
so we shouldn't pry.

74
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,820
Sui.

75
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,220
Don't follow my example.

76
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,110
Have you visited the Empress Dowager?

77
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,060
Not yet.

78
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,060
Yan asked me to invite you and Chi
to his residence.

79
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,380
He said he needs your help with something.

80
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Both of us?

81
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,380
Not just me for medical treatment?

82
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,380
Yan specifically instructed

83
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,180
you to bring your coroner's kit.

84
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,170
[Prince Xin's Mansion]

85
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,530
Your Highness, they're here.

86
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,700
Esteemed couple.

87
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,990
Newly wedded as you are,

88
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,110
I apologize for the intrusion.

89
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,370
I truly have no choice.

90
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,300
Chi.

91
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,820
You won't blame me, will you?

92
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,940
You jest, Yan.

93
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,430
Has your eyesight improved, Yan?

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,960
Thanks to Wan's treatment,

95
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,870
my vision has indeed improved,

96
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,980
though

97
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,680
I can only make out shapes

98
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,790
in dim light.

99
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,380
Yan, why did you ask me
to bring my coroner's kit?

100
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
If there's any legal matter,

101
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,110
it's best to report it
to the authorities first.

102
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,260
It concerns a private matter

103
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,030
from years ago
in Prince Xin's family.

104
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,760
Before the truth is uncovered,

105
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,550
Wan and Chi, I kindly ask you both

106
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,940
to keep this matter discreet.

107
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,070
That's only proper.

108
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,700
Mother.

109
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,020
I've brought Chi and his wife, Wan,

110
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,990
to see you.

111
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,140
Are these...

112
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,409
The late Princess Xin's remains?

113
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,790
All these years,

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,060
I've done everything in my power

115
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,950
to preserve Mother's body,

116
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,770
but this is the best I could do.

117
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,909
Yan, do you want me to perform an autopsy
on the late Princess's body?

118
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:17,740
Why?

119
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,900
Because I want to know

120
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,010
what exactly caused Mother's death.

121
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,640
Please help me, Wan.

122
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,130
Yan, there's no need for this.

123
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,680
I will certainly do my best.

124
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,910
It's just

125
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,060
investigating the cause of death

126
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,030
will inevitably damage the body.

127
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,290
It would be best for you to stay away,
Yan.

128
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,500
It's okay.

129
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,800
She's already gone,

130
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,940
and her body

131
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,350
will eventually turn to dust.

132
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,030
The truth

133
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,380
is my only consolation now.

134
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,640
Mother's spirit in heaven

135
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,260
will surely understand my intentions.

136
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,430
Besides,

137
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,180
Wan, you probably don't know that

138
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,670
before my late mother was married,

139
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,060
she also studied with the Medicine King,

140
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,300
learning pharmaceutical skills for a year,

141
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,560
making her somewhat his apprentice too.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,480
She had long come to terms with

143
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,670
the cycle of life and death,

144
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,670
and surely wouldn't mind
what happens after she died.

145
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,909
So the late Princess Xin and I share
the bond of being fellow disciples.

146
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm deeply honored.

147
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,260
I'll definitely do everything in my power

148
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,670
to bring the cause of
the late Princess's death

149
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,700
to light.

150
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,820
Thank you, Wan.

151
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,080
The skull is intact,

152
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,420
muscle lines unclear,

153
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,620
small and thin.

154
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,910
The pelvis is wide and short,

155
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,350
with thin pelvic walls.

156
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
The side walls are flat and shallow.

157
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,470
The pelvic cavity is short and wide,

158
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,130
forming a cylindrical shape.

159
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,390
The corpse is well-preserved,

160
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,180
and there are obvious signs of childbirth.

161
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,100
Yan.

162
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,190
The late Princess was

163
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,140
in the prime of her youth when she died.

164
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,400
Since you suspect
the cause of her death,

165
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,990
what unusual symptoms

166
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,590
did she show before passing?

167
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,230
That day,

168
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,520
Mother went into the palace

169
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,070
to deliver medicine
she personally prepared for the Empress.

170
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,930
She only returned home
after the night watch began.

171
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,680
As soon as she got home,

172
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,700
she shut herself in her bedroom.

173
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
I was worried,

174
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,790
so I snuck in to check on her.

175
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,260
Ze.

176
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,340
Ze!

177
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,350
Ze...

178
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:26,940
At first,

179
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,470
Mother only had chest pains.

180
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,230
Ze!

181
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,870
Then she lost her sight.

182
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,310
Soon after, her hearing

183
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,190
failed as well.

184
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,620
Before dying, she lost all her senses

185
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,750
and was vomiting blood continuously.

186
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,950
In just one night,

187
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,670
she was gone.

188
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,800
The imperial physician came,

189
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,470
but claimed that Mother

190
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,320
showed no signs of poisoning.

191
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,660
But since that day,

192
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,710
my health

193
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
and my eyesight

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,990
have been deteriorating day by day.

195
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,320
Did the physician examine that cup of tea?

196
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,230
Since the physician said

197
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,910
it wasn't poisoning,

198
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,910
why would he bother with
such trivial matters?

199
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,620
May I perform an autopsy
and test for poison on the late Princess?

200
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,810
The color of these bones

201
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,420
is too dull.

202
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,470
Use mine.

203
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,590
No.

204
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,910
Mine should be used.

205
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,840
The late Princess indeed
died of poisoning.

206
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,150
The mystery that has troubled me

207
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,230
for years is finally solved.

208
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,030
Thank you, Wan.

209
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,050
The incense is cool and delicate,

210
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,930
carrying a serene grace reminiscent
of winter plum blossoms.

211
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,590
It's seemingly made from
submerged agarwood,

212
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,310
cloves,

213
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,140
and rose water.

214
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,110
Indeed.

215
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,310
This incense

216
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,500
is called Soul-Reviving Plum,

217
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
my late mother's favorite incense.

218
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,420
If you like it, Wan,

219
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,760
I'll make some more for you.

220
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,710
Yan.

221
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,250
You still need to avoid

222
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,590
straining your eyes.

223
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,910
Since childhood, my late mother

224
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,780
had taught me how to craft
and appreciate incense.

225
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,470
Now,

226
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,530
whenever I blend fragrances,

227
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,920
it feels as if Mother

228
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,660
is still right here by my side.

229
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,140
Yan, you still have your mother's memories
for comfort.

230
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,200
That's already much more than I have.

231
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,110
Chi.

232
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,390
Have you ever questioned

233
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,850
your mother's cause of death?

234
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,140
What do you mean by that, Yan?

235
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,800
Less than seven days
after my mother passed away,

236
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,830
your mother

237
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,470
died due to

238
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,230
postpartum hemorrhage.

239
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,590
In life, they were

240
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,380
close friends,

241
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,030
and they both met tragic deaths
almost simultaneously,

242
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,950
which seems too coincidental.

243
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,770
The Empress Dowager and my late father

244
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,350
never mentioned this to me.

245
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,940
Back then, your father entrusted you,

246
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,340
barely 100 days old,
to the Empress Dowager

247
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,260
and went to Shuoxi alone.

248
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,590
Rumors spread throughout the capital,

249
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,900
saying that your father believed

250
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,500
you weren't his biological son,

251
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,590
so he abandoned you

252
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,590
and returned to Shuoxi in anger.

253
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,700
If not orchestrated,

254
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,560
how could the rumors all be so consistent?

255
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,240
Yan Chi.

256
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,740
Rumors stop with the wise.

257
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,540
These petty tricks

258
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,410
are nothing compared to Father's

259
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,740
loyalty and courage.

260
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,620
Yan.

261
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,230
Are you suggesting that

262
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,710
my mother was framed?

263
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,750
I have only suspicions,

264
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,260
but no proof.

265
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,150
With all these considered,

266
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,020
Chi and Wan, please

267
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,930
help me uncover the truth.

268
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,820
Yan, since you've suspected the causes of
the Princesses' deaths for years,

269
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,410
have you discovered anything about

270
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,340
the culprit's identity or motive?

271
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,240
Since my father followed my mother
in death,

272
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,470
I, as a

273
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,260
blind and frail royal descendant,

274
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,420
despite all my suspicions and resentment,

275
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,740
am powerless.

276
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,190
Chi, if you and Wan

277
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,190
can help resolve my doubts,

278
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,600
I would be

279
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
deeply grateful.

280
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,020
Yan Chi.

281
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,350
Childbirth for a woman
is like passing through death's door.

282
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,420
Even without poison,

283
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,720
there are many ways
that can cause death.

284
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,680
Mother has been gone for years.

285
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,620
Even if I were to exhume her remains now,

286
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,470
it would still be difficult
to determine the cause of death.

287
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,800
If what Yan said is true,

288
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,380
we might as well start by investigating
the late Princess Xin,

289
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,470
so as not to disturb Mother's spirit.

290
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,230
Do you know who the late Princess Xin

291
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,310
brought medicine to in the palace?

292
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,600
It was His Majesty.

293
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,620
His Majesty returned gravely wounded
back then.

294
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,020
If the late Princess Xin
hadn't brought medicine into the palace,

295
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,660
he might not have survived.

296
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,470
So you mean

297
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,990
the person who poisoned Mother

298
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,830
might not only be the Empress,

299
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,520
but also be His Majesty?

300
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,070
I can't make sense of this, either.

301
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,540
Logically speaking,

302
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,660
the late Princess Xin

303
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,070
saved His Majesty's life,

304
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,200
so why would His Majesty and the Empress
want to kill her?

305
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,710
Perhaps it was because the late Prince Xin

306
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,380
had extensive connections at court,

307
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,500
and His Majesty was just
recovering from serious injuries,

308
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,300
so he wanted to secure his power.

309
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,470
But that doesn't make sense either.

310
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,420
Why target the late Princess Xin?

311
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,220
Forget it.

312
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,950
There are too few clues.

313
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,610
I'm at a loss at how to proceed.

314
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,870
Too many things

315
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,020
are connected to the palace.

316
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,770
Let's investigate Prince Jin's case first.

317
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,190
Today,

318
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,310
Sui brought up Consort Jin's death
to me unprompted.

319
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,910
I noticed his expression was
very different from usual,

320
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,500
as if he remembered something

321
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,070
but was afraid to speak of it.

322
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,310
In the next few days,
I want to enter the palace more often

323
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,740
to keep the Empress Dowager
and Sui company.

324
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,990
With everything that's happened,

325
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,790
they must be suffering the most.

326
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,230
There's one more thing.

327
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,790
Jiang Heying,
the one who assassinated Father,

328
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,270
indeed works for Yan Qi.

329
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,980
Yan Qi has been sending him money
frequently these years

330
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,380
to train assassins.

331
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,720
When His Majesty

332
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,619
allowed him to return to his hometown
in Qianzhou as a chief general,

333
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,660
it was likely arranged
by Yan Qi behind the scenes as well.

334
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,990
How heartless.

335
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,270
Even if he disregards
the brotherhood between you two,

336
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,930
Prince Rui is still his uncle.

337
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,790
In the royal family,
there are no true father-son bonds,

338
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,190
let alone uncle and nephew relationships.

339
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,140
However,

340
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,620
whether Prince Cheng acted on his own

341
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,830
or under His Majesty's orders,

342
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,900
we may never know.

343
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,310
If it truly was on His Majesty's order,

344
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,640
we won't be able to touch him
anytime soon.

345
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,510
We need to find a way

346
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,380
to make Yan Qi
fall out of royal favor first.

347
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,750
Don't worry about that.

348
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,180
I already have a plan.

349
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,220
Now that he has hopes of becoming heir,

350
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,930
his ambition is at its peak.

351
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,900
He will certainly use Wang Han's testimony

352
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,980
to try to depose the Empress

353
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,700
and root out the Crown Prince completely.

354
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,160
As soon as he takes action,

355
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,020
that's when I'll spring my trap.

356
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,650
Your Highness.

357
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,510
This is freshly stewed
angelica mutton soup.

358
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,220
Have some while it's warm.

359
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,280
I have no appetite.

360
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,160
Just leave it there.

361
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,640
Then perhaps later.

362
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,110
All right.

363
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,410
Mother also specifically instructed me

364
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,020
to prepare medicinal food
for Your Highness as prescribed.

365
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,110
You've gone to visit Mother?

366
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,750
Has Mother suffered any more torture?

367
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,550
Mother is a woman of strong will.

368
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,310
Now that the Empress Dowager
has regained control of palace affairs,

369
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,910
no one dares
to withhold Mother's allowances.

370
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,480
Mother

371
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,160
hopes Your Highness will remain calm.

372
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,290
In time,

373
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,790
someone will help us

374
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,650
resolve this crisis completely.

375
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,160
I've asked my father

376
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,900
to deliver Mother's letter
to your uncle's army.

377
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,230
Please don't give up hope, Your Highness.

378
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,030
Thank you for your efforts, Zhaoyu.

379
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,620
As long as Your Highness is well,

380
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,620
no matter how difficult it is for me,

381
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,920
I'm happy to endure it.

382
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,950
This sweet soup I prepared for
Your Majesty

383
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,110
simmered for a full four hours.

384
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,350
I've been waiting for
Your Majesty to come tonight.

385
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,110
You finally came.

386
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,660
My beloved, as for this sweet soup,

387
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,220
why is it always

388
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,590
so mild in flavor?

389
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,070
Wouldn't it be better

390
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,420
if it were a bit sweeter?

391
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,260
I'm worried that too much sweetness

392
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,720
might be bad for my complexion.

393
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,900
My beloved, you've always been

394
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
the most beautiful woman in the palace.

395
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,400
With Your Majesty's praise,

396
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,410
even if I were to die right now,

397
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,750
my heart would still be filled with joy.

398
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,940
I'm quite tired today.

399
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,230
Let's

400
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,320
retire early.

401
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,920
Your Highness. Your Highness.

402
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,590
It's time to get up, Your Highness.

403
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,520
The contact is waiting at the door.

404
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,440
Uncle has come for us?

405
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,620
Hurry up and get changed.

406
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,590
It's time to go.

407
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,270
All right.

408
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,350
Zhaoyu,

409
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,700
why haven't you changed yet?

410
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,500
Your Highness, I'm not leaving.

411
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,380
I've never practiced martial arts.

412
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,110
I'm not good at riding horse,
nor can I run fast.

413
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,830
I would only be a burden to Your Highness.

414
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,960
If I stay behind,
I can stall them a bit.

415
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,600
Any delay will be helpful.

416
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,270
No,

417
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,870
staying here is too dangerous.

418
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,600
Come with me.

419
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,660
Your Highness.

420
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,900
After all, I'm the eldest
legitimate daughter of the Qin family.

421
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,500
They wouldn't dare harm me.

422
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,200
Please hurry up and leave, Your Highness.

423
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,900
Please go.

424
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,420
If I can escape safely,

425
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,650
I promise I'll come back for you.

426
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,510
Go.

427
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,270
Greetings, Your Highness.

428
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,180
The situation is critical.

429
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,510
I'm afraid you'll have to
put up with this.

430
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,620
How did it go?

431
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,550
His Highness has met with the contact

432
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,090
and safely left the detention area.

433
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,790
The Crown Princess took the initiative
to stay and cover for His Highness.

434
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,660
Great.

435
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,300
The Qin family deserves
great credit for this.

436
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,870
Now that His Highness has escaped,

437
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,120
you should find a way to seek shelter too,
Your Majesty.

438
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,030
If the attendants notice this
when bringing breakfast,

439
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,560
His Majesty will surely
come to question you.

440
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,110
I'd like to see

441
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,220
in what manner he dares face me.

442
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,870
[Qionghua Palace]

443
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,750
Fire! Fire!

444
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,590
Help! Someone help!

445
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,900
Help! Fire!

446
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,110
There's a fire!

447
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,510
Someone come quickly!

448
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,310
Yuan Qing!

449
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,420
Where's the fire?

450
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,420
Your Majesty,

451
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,660
judging by the flames,

452
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,790
it seems to be the Imperial Clan Court.

453
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,980
Your Majesty,

454
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,350
please put on more clothes.

455
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,220
Your Majesty!

456
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,660
Father,

457
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,420
the fire at the Imperial Clan Court
has been put out.

458
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,460
Only the detain area of Prince Che
suffered severe damage;

459
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,070
the fire didn't spread elsewhere.

460
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,420
How are Prince Che and his wife?

461
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,970
Princess Zhaoyu is unharmed,

462
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,420
but Prince Che...

463
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,730
His whereabouts are unknown.

464
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,750
I searched the fire scene

465
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,730
and found no corpse or remains.

466
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,220
How absurd!

467
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,270
The heavily guarded restricted area

468
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,800
mysteriously caught fire,

469
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,380
and somehow the confined Prince Che

470
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,310
just vanished without a trace?

471
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,380
Father, please don't worry.

472
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,500
I've investigated and found out that

473
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,150
the fire

474
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,230
started in Prince Che's bedchamber.

475
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,550
But with Prince Che missing,

476
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,900
it's inappropriate for me to question

477
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,750
Princess Zhaoyu about matters
in their private chambers.

478
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,040
However, I believe

479
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,940
Prince Che's disappearance
and the fire

480
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,830
must be connected.

481
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,620
I've ordered a review of the Imperial Clan
Court's personnel records

482
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,180
to identify any suspicious individuals.

483
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,790
Would an arsonist bold enough
to set fire to the Imperial Clan Court

484
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,900
be so obedient

485
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,760
as to register

486
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,510
their name in the records?

487
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,910
I was foolish.

488
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,550
Chi.

489
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

490
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,880
Do you also believe

491
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,480
Prince Che's mysterious disappearance

492
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,160
and the fire at

493
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,900
the Imperial Clan Court

494
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,300
are somewhat connected?

495
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,510
I haven't examined the fire scene,

496
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,840
so I dare not speculate.

497
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,280
However, I believe

498
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,310
Prince Che's disappearance
should not be made public.

499
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,460
I'm willing to depart immediately

500
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,860
to search for Prince Che.

501
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,660
Anyone capable of

502
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,460
sneaking in the Imperial Clan Court
at night

503
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,030
is no ordinary person.

504
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,310
Take Wan

505
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,640
to the Imperial Clan Court
for investigation immediately—

506
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,620
be sure

507
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,950
to find the mastermind behind this arson.

508
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
As for

509
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,030
the search for Che,

510
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,920
leave that to Prince Cheng.

511
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,300
As

512
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,430
you command, Your Majesty.

513
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,310
You may leave as well.

514
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,940
Come on.

515
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,700
Rise.

516
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,930
Thank you, Father.

517
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,030
I have received

518
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,030
a report that

519
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,340
Lord Zhao has secretly brought a troop

520
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,820
and is staking out outside the capital.

521
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,180
I'm worried that

522
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,390
your brother Che
has been bewitched by Zhao

523
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,520
and may commit treason.

524
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,550
I specially order you
to go and stop him immediately.

525
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,010
If he truly harbors rebellious intentions,

526
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,220
then don't blame me

527
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,070
for setting aside our father-son bond.

528
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,940
I am

529
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,930
willing to ease your burden, Father.

530
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,590
You are good.

531
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,360
Now,

532
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,350
you are the only grown son I have

533
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,510
fit to serve as heir.

534
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
If

535
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,360
anything goes wrong,

536
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,830
you must

537
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,460
prioritize your own safety above all.

538
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,170
Father, you've shown me so much care.

539
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,310
I'll definitely

540
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,440
not fail your expectations, Father.

541
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,180
Go now.

542
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,950
I take my leave, Father.

543
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,620
Prince Che
hasn't been sleeping well lately,

544
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,080
[Imperial Clan Court]

545
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,510
so Princess Zhaoyu doesn't allow us

546
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,030
to attend to him before bed at night.

547
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,660
Right.

548
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,120
That's why we slept quite deeply
last night,

549
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,940
with no one keeping watch in the yard.

550
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,310
By the time we smelled the smoke

551
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,830
and rushed here to put out the fire,

552
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,870
Prince Che was already gone.

553
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,810
Where were the Imperial Guards
on duty last night?

554
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,890
Your Highness.

555
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,750
Only we servants were stationed here.

556
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,210
No Imperial Guards
have ever been assigned.

557
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,100
Understood.

558
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,030
You may leave.

559
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,200
Yes.

560
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,740
Is there anything wrong?

561
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,530
According to the rule,

562
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,620
the restricted quarters
where a prince is confined

563
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,940
should have at least three shifts
of Imperial Guards on duty in rotation.

564
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,470
But there isn't even
one Imperial Guard here,

565
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,990
which is truly abnormal.

566
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,550
The Imperial Guards
answer directly to His Majesty.

567
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,350
Perhaps

568
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,750
His Majesty intentionally left
Prince Che a way out?

569
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,750
If His Majesty truly had such intentions,

570
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,620
he could have simply

571
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,550
demoted Yan Che to a commoner

572
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,790
and sentenced him to exile.

573
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,450
Why would he confine him here,

574
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,110
neither releasing him

575
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,420
nor guarding him strictly?

576
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,680
His Majesty's actions

577
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,070
seem more like setting a trap.

578
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,790
This must be where the fire started.

579
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,900
There are no tables or desks around here,

580
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,270
which suggests this candlestick
wasn't originally placed here,

581
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,310
but was used by someone
to set the curtains on fire

582
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,980
and then carelessly discarded.

583
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,700
The duty room is right
in the outer quarters.

584
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,940
It would only take the attendants
a few seconds to get here.

585
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,590
Prince Che must have left
before the fire started.

586
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,270
What if the arsonist

587
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,510
was Princess Zhaoyu?

588
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,620
Ms. Qin, come out and respond immediately,

589
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,620
or you'll be charged with treason.

590
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,350
What is he doing here instead of

591
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,880
searching for Prince Che?

592
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,200
Because when villains gain power,

593
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,590
they first become wildly arrogant.

594
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,110
It took you so long to come out here.

595
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,700
What,

596
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,590
feeling too ashamed

597
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,620
to show your face?

598
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,600
Prince Cheng, mind your words.

599
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,940
Even though Prince Che
has been deposed and confined,

600
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,670
I'm still your sister-in-law,

601
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,110
and you should show me some respect.

602
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,420
Sister-in-law?

603
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,870
Are you worthy of that title?

604
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,940
You committed arson

605
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
and helped
the deposed Crown Prince escape.

606
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,380
You only deserve to call yourself
Sinner Qin.

607
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,640
You accuse me of arson,

608
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,180
but do you have any evidence,
Prince Cheng?

609
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,870
My word is the evidence.

610
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,910
Let me ask you,

611
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,180
where has the deposed Crown Prince
fled to?

612
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,550
I was in shock,

613
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,490
so I don't remember anything.

614
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,140
Then I'll have to let the matrons
from the Imperial Punishment Department

615
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,540
help you jog your memory.

616
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,070
Someone,

617
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,670
tie her up!

618
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,830
Yes.

619
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,550
You even put on the hood.

620
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,380
You're shameless!

621
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,700
Prince Cheng, are you trying to openly
assault a member of the imperial family?

622
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,750
Yan Chi.

623
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,380
What are you doing?

624
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,110
I want to kill you.

625
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,790
Are you sure?

626
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,180
If you kill me with your own hands,

627
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,970
Father will never let you off.

628
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,550
Your entire family

629
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,380
and your Princess Wan

630
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,660
will all be buried with me.

631
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,070
Buried with me!

632
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,350
I'll spare Qin

633
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,220
if you spare me,

634
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,320
what do you say?

635
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,230
Yan Chi.

636
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,170
His Majesty is still waiting for
the investigation results.

637
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,420
His Majesty personally ordered
me and Princess Wan

638
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,880
to investigate the scene.

639
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,560
Princess Zhaoyu is an eyewitness,

640
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,420
and should rightfully be in my custody.

641
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,220
Prince Cheng,
I hope you'll carefully remember

642
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,280
the task His Majesty assigned to you.

643
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,240
If you overstep your bounds again,

644
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,620
I wouldn't mind

645
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,780
disciplining you on His Majesty's behalf.

646
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,470
I've taken note of it.

647
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,900
It won't happen again.

648
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,920
I've already examined the fire scene.

649
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,380
You deliberately set the fire

650
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,900
during breakfast to give

651
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,510
Prince Che time to escape, didn't you?

652
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,700
This matter cannot be concealed.

653
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,900
Even if it weren't me,

654
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,830
someone else would investigate

655
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,140
and easily conclude it was arson.

656
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,660
Did you consider

657
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,970
the consequences before acting?

658
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,550
I did.

659
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,590
But what other option did I have?

660
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,230
If Prince Rui were in danger,

661
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,270
what would you do?

662
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,150
If you could risk your life

663
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,929
to give him a chance of survival,

664
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,710
would you do it?

665
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,940
I would.

666
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,870
Therefore,

667
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,040
I will never reveal his whereabouts.

668
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,830
I never intended to survive.

669
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,020
Imprisonment or beheading,

670
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,540
I accept whatever His Majesty decides.

671
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,000
If we wanted to charge you,

672
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
we wouldn't have saved you
from Prince Cheng just now.

673
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,980
But do you know that

674
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,710
you won't be the only one
held accountable?

675
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,790
If His Majesty pursues this matter,

676
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,409
the entire Qin family's lives
will be at risk.

677
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,190
I know.

678
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,580
But I couldn't bear

679
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,870
to watch him

680
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,330
trapped to death here.

681
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,610
Even if we were willing

682
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,480
to stay here for the rest of our lives,

683
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,460
Prince Cheng would never spare us.

684
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,230
I had no choice.

685
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,190
It was my fault for lacking resolve.

686
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,720
If I had taken my own life
during the fire,

687
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,800
I wouldn't have implicated
my parents and siblings.

688
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,460
Wan,

689
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,750
I beg you.

690
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,270
If you would help me,

691
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,930
the Qin family could be saved.

692
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,060
I only ask you

693
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,090
to wait another two hours.

694
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,030
Once Prince Che
safely leaves the capital,

695
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,310
you can tell His Majesty the truth.

696
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,060
I beg you.

697
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,870
Please get up.

698
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,060
Zhaoyu, you don't need to beg me.

699
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,400
Even if just for my father's sake,

700
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,480
I won't stand by and do nothing.

701
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,520
Besides,

702
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,880
in my heart,

703
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,580
you're also a victim.

704
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,160
I'll do my best
to protect you and your mother.

705
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,670
But since your father and brother

706
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,330
are too deeply entangled
with the Crown Prince,

707
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm afraid I can't save them.

708
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,750
Gamblers must accept defeat.

709
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,830
Since Father chose
to assist the Crown Prince,

710
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,350
he should bear the consequences.

711
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,830
All right.

712
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,630
Previously,

713
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,630
out of jealousy,

714
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,270
I grew suspicious of you,

715
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,430
and that was wrong of me.

716
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,570
I apologize

717
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,100
to you here.

718
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,930
Please get up, Zhaoyu.

719
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,580
Let bygones be bygones.

720
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,780
As long as

721
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,550
there're no more misunderstanding
between us in the future.

722
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,980
Yan Li.

723
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,750
Chi.

724
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,540
What's up?

725
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,980
Did His Majesty mention anything
about Prince Che's escape?

726
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,630
No.

727
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,960
His Majesty has been handling
state affairs all morning

728
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,710
and hasn't said a word
about Prince Che.

729
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,530
Perhaps

730
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,930
he wants to conceal the news

731
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,260
to prevent unrest among court officials.

732
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,750
Everyone knows about
the fire at the Imperial Clan Court.

733
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,830
If it's not clarified,

734
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,630
that's what would cause unrest.

735
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,420
His Majesty must be aware of this.

736
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,270
Perhaps

737
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,470
His Majesty is demonstrating
his unpredictable imperial authority,

738
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,050
deliberately keeping us in the dark
about his intentions.

739
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,980
Prince Che's fate is still unknown.

740
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,020
No matter how much he wants
to demonstrate his authority,

741
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,670
he wouldn't use this situation
for posturing.

742
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,710
Not necessarily.

743
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,480
Yan's eyes haven't recovered,

744
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,830
yet he still runs around happily all day,

745
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,870
delaying my marriage with Ning.

746
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,830
Isn't that just to show that

747
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,060
he can remain calm

748
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,260
even if Mount Tai collapses before him?

749
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,540
Perhaps

750
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,100
it's precisely because I cannot see

751
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,670
that I have no fear.

752
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,270
And without fear, there is no worry.

753
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,660
Yan, you're really as light as a swallow.

754
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
I didn't even hear your footsteps.

755
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,760
Why have you come here, Yan?

756
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,460
I originally wanted to ask about the fire,

757
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,830
but hearing what you've said,

758
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,870
I'd better not

759
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,400
bring trouble upon myself.

760
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,480
Let's pretend I was never here.

761
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,350
Then

762
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,620
we never saw you, Yan.

763
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,670
Chi.

764
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,870
Considering how often you took the blame
for me when we were little,

765
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll definitely keep it a secret, Yan.

766
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,600
If it weren't for my eye condition,

767
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,400
whenever you got into trouble,

768
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,310
I would have outrun you.

769
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,030
Do you really mean it?

770
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,230
Without a doubt.

771
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,020
Chi.

772
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,650
Look.

773
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,100
This is me.

774
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,020
Then this is me.

775
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,510
Holding hands.

776
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,980
Why did you draw yourself as tall as me?

777
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,040
I want to draw it even taller than you.

778
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,310
Taking off!

779
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,310
Taking off!

780
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,290
Yan,

781
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,500
come with me.

782
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,880
It's right here.

783
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,610
Feel it.

784
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,270
His Majesty has arrived.

785
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,400
Sinner Zhao, kneel immediately
to welcome His Majesty.

786
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,470
In the first year of Zhaohui,

787
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,040
His Majesty personally bestowed upon me
the title of Empress.

788
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,310
Unless there is an imperial edict

789
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,240
announcing to the world
that my position is revoked,

790
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,500
I remain

791
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,520
the most noble woman under heaven.

792
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
The Empress Dowager is still alive.

793
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,930
The most noble woman under heaven

794
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,890
is not yet you.

795
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,310
Now,

796
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,310
your brother has dared to

797
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,230
lead the Northern Army into the capital
without imperial permission,

798
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,020
conspiring with you

799
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,130
to help Prince Che escape.

800
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,190
How dare you still shamelessly

801
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,870
claim yourself Empress?

802
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,510
My elder brother

803
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,830
has commanded the Northern Army
by imperial order for years,

804
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,870
serving Your Majesty loyally
and protecting the nation without fail.

805
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,150
Everything I've done

806
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,450
is also for keeping
the legitimate bloodline

807
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,430
of the Yan family unstained.

808
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,770
Why am I not worthy of being the Empress?

809
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,150
A weak and incompetent

810
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,850
Crown Prince,

811
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,230
unfit to be a ruler—

812
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,940
what does it matter even if he's of
the legitimate bloodline?

813
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,150
If you

814
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,950
have any self-awareness,

815
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,380
relinquish the position of Empress
as soon as possible.

816
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:05,970
I

817
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,940
will ensure the safety of
you and your son

818
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,630
for the rest of your lives.

819
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,070
Otherwise,

820
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,350
don't blame me

821
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,670
for disregarding our marital bond.

822
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,980
Marital bond?

823
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,230
What marital bond ever existed between us?

824
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,710
If it weren't for
Che's claim to the throne,

825
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,270
how could I have borne with you
all these years?

826
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,510
Do you think

827
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,670
just by securing your position as Empress,

828
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,830
and with the Northern Army

829
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,710
backing that worthless son of yours,

830
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,140
you can seize my empire?

831
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,520
You're truly outsmarted
by your own cleverness.

832
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,150
Zhao Shuhua.

833
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,290
Haven't you ever wondered

834
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,060
why the security
at the Imperial Clan Court was so lax,

835
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,100
allowing that worthless son of yours

836
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,830
to escape so easily?

837
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,690
What have you done?

838
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,870
I had promised the Empress Dowager

839
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,710
to spare Yan Che's life.

840
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,350
If he hadn't escaped,

841
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,150
as long as the Empress Dowager is alive,

842
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,790
I

843
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,890
would never cause her grief.

844
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,970
But alas,

845
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,900
he ran away.

846
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,440
Since he doesn't want my protection,

847
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,710
I have no choice but to let him

848
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,870
resign himself to fate.

849
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,830
I'll kill you!

850
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,100
You demon!

851
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,080
Give me back my Che!

852
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,670
Let him go!

853
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,190
Spare him!

854
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,790
The Empress dislikes light.

855
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,310
Remove all candles and lamps.

856
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,100
From now on, Fengyi Palace
shall not see even

857
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,920
a glimmer of light.

858
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,940
Don't go! Come back!

859
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:36,560
♪ Endless wind and rain ♪

860
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,700
Come back!

861
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,620
Che...

862
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,930
♪ What a pity ♪

863
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,580
My Che...

864
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:51,240
♪ Endless wind and rain ♪

865
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,450
♪ What a pity ♪
