00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,340
[FEUD]

2
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,030
[Episode 3]

3
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,580
[Cang Tu]

4
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,280
I am Cang Tu, the steward
of Canglei Palace.

5
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,410
Greetings, My Lady.

6
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,190
So this is the Canglei Palace where
the Heavenly Lord lives?

7
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,470
It's completely different from
what I imagined.

8
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,070
It's actually quite modest.

9
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,220
This is the courtyard for you
to live in, My Lady.

10
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,780
Won't I be living with the Heavenly Lord?

11
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,770
His Lordship is tied up with affairs.
He will come when he's finished.

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
But isn't today the day

13
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,030
the Heavenly Lord and I
are getting married?

14
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,630
Don't you divine beings need to
bow at the hall

15
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,490
and enter the bridal chamber
when getting married?

16
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,910
His Lordship really can't get away.
Please understand, My Lady.

17
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,840
This is Ning Yan.

18
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,340
[Ning Yan]

19
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,590
She will be your maid and at your service
from now on, My Lady.

20
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,720
Greetings, My Lady.

21
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,400
Please make sure to tell
the Heavenly Lord that

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll be waiting for him here.

23
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,340
Yes, I will.

24
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,410
My Lord.

25
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,370
That one from the Jingyun Sect
has been settled.

26
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,210
Are you sure you don't want to go
and check on her, My Lord?

27
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,450
There's no rush.

28
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
Hua Ruyue!

29
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,960
You plundered celestial artifacts
and seized blessed lands.

30
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,090
Do you plead guilty?

31
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,400
Bai Jiusi.

32
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,720
You're the guilty one!

33
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,280
[Divine Lord Siling: Hua Ruyue]

34
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,710
Ruyue!

35
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,840
Stop it!

36
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,400
Do you think

37
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,930
they look similar?

38
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
My eyes are not keen enough.

39
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,250
Apart from the appearance,

40
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,230
I haven't noticed any similarities
between them.

41
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
He's really not coming, huh?

42
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,620
My Lady.

43
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,870
His Lordship might just be...

44
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,670
Hasn't dinner been brought yet?

45
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,640
I've been waiting all day. I'm hungry.

46
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,100
I apologize for letting you
go hungry, My Lady.

47
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,590
Here in the Nine Heavens,

48
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,830
there are either enlightened immortals,
who have ascended,

49
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,160
or divine beings born here.

50
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Over time,

51
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,570
we've forgotten that mortals need to eat.

52
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,750
Don't you immortals eat at all?

53
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,830
It's not that we don't eat at all.

54
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,800
We can eat a little when
we crave something.

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,730
But we won't starve if we don't eat.

56
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,330
In that case,

57
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,430
being an immortal does
have its advantages.

58
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,360
At least you don't have to worry about
food and drink.

59
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,670
This fruit of yours is amazing.

60
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,890
I was starving earlier,

61
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,390
but after just a few bites,
I feel somewhat full.

62
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,440
Of course.

63
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm the spirit of the Jianmu Tree,
and these are my fruits.

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Of course they're incomparable to those
mundane fruits of the mortal world.

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,760
Jianmu?

66
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,850
Is that the legendary divine tree?

67
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,880
Years ago, I cultivated on Mount Wuji.

68
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,000
I gained enlightenment, absorbed
the essence of frost and dew,

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,510
inhaled and exhaled primordial energy,
and practiced day and night.

70
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,600
It took countless years,

71
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,070
but I established my foundation, condensed
my meridians, and became an immortal.

72
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,600
The Nine Heavens are truly
full of talented beings.

73
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,210
Of course. This is the Nine Heavens
after all.

74
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,530
My Lady, I'll take care of you
from now on.

75
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,220
Please feel free to ask me for
anything you need.

76
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,730
Actually, there is one thing.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,720
What is it?

78
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,690
Where does the Heavenly Lord live?

79
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,659
In the Canglei Palace, of course.

80
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,120
I'll go find him then.

81
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,000
My Lady.

82
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,800
Lord Cang Tu said you should wait here.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,430
Please don't wander off.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,950
You don't understand.

85
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,230
I must see the Heavenly Lord tonight.

86
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,270
Why is that?

87
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,870
Novels say

88
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,370
if a bride spends her wedding night alone,

89
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,360
the couple's married life will
be very rocky.

90
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,770
It's not that I won't let you go.

91
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,470
Please, come with me and see.

92
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,860
The Tianmu Peak is enormous!

93
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,159
This is the passage between the divine
and demonic realms.

94
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,500
Naturally, it took some effort to build.

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,310
Which direction is the quickest way
down the mountain?

96
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,040
There's no path down from here.

97
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,390
You can't fly, and you're not prepared.

98
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,520
Going down recklessly would be fatal.

99
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,140
Who says I'm not prepared?

100
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,560
You're all the preparation I need.

101
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,870
Slowly.

102
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,860
Be careful.

103
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,990
My Lady, I can only send you this far.

104
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,830
I'm bound by the Binding Spell

105
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,409
which prevents me from
leaving Tianmu Peak.

106
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,870
Tianmu Peak, where we are now,
is in the far north,

107
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,000
while the Canglei Palace is
in the far south.

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
If you want to go to the Canglei Palace,

109
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,900
just keep heading south.

110
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,950
It's a long journey.

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
It will take at least 10 days.

112
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,570
10 days it is, then.

113
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,030
As long as I don't sleep along the way,

114
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,690
I won't be considered spending
the night alone.

115
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,280
Please be careful, My Lady.

116
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,630
If you're unlucky and encounter danger,

117
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,720
you can also mention that you're

118
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,580
Heavenly Lord Dacheng's wife
to protect yourself.

119
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Who? Who hit me?

120
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,900
There are enemies!

121
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,900
Where are they? Where?

122
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,080
Where? Where?

123
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,050
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

124
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,160
A woman?

125
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,910
A woman, where? Where?

126
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,840
Third Brother, open your eyes and look.

127
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,100
Don't try to trick me into opening my
eyes. If you want to look, do it yourself.

128
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,600
So you guys can't see?

129
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,720
You're the one who can't see.
We're having a bet here.

130
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,200
A bet?

131
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,750
Yes, a bet.

132
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,550
Many years ago, there was a woman.

133
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,610
She made a bet with us three brothers.

134
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,760
Whoever opens their eyes first loses.

135
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,880
So what about that woman?

136
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,040
That woman went home to close her eyes.

137
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
If she opens her eyes,

138
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,470
she'll come back and tell us.

139
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,630
How do you know she wasn't tricking you?

140
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,790
She wouldn't.

141
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,330
We made a deal.

142
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,900
There's a saying in the mortal realm,

143
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
which goes...

144
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,630
Second Brother, how does it go again?

145
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,890
"Once a word is spoken,

146
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,040
even four..."

147
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,080
Right, four...

148
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,670
Even four Qilin beasts can't recall it.

149
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,480
Brother, it's "four horses."

150
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,960
Right, right.

151
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,630
Brother, it should be "four horses."

152
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,550
W-Whether it's Qilin beasts or horses
doesn't matter.

153
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,750
I-It doesn't matter.

154
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,720
The most important thing...

155
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,120
Is...

156
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,750
You.

157
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,530
We brothers hate women the most.

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,910
And we specifically target women
who can't fly.

159
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,390
Why specifically target those
who can't fly?

160
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,790
Because we can't beat the ones
who can fly, of course.

161
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,390
Why do you have so many questions?

162
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,120
Just tell us, can you fly or not?

163
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,690
I can't.

164
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,440
That makes it easy then.

165
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,050
Brothers, let's get her.

166
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,610
Hold on!

167
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm Heavenly Lord Dacheng's wife.

168
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,330
Then we have even more
reason to resent you!

169
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,540
You shouldn't have let her talk so much.

170
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,240
Is that woman dead?

171
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,120
Sounds like she's still breathing.

172
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,420
Let's see if she dares to come to
the Stone Forest again.

173
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,270
Before we acted,

174
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,870
I felt like I could

175
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,390
Bai Jiusi's stench.

176
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,290
It's late at night. Why say
such unlucky things?

177
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,720
Retreat!

178
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,790
Is anyone there?

179
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,790
[Puyuan]

180
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,300
Master, I have a secret matter to report.

181
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,410
I wonder if you remember
Xiao Jingshan, Master?

182
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,750
He was originally the most skilled

183
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,030
artifact-forging human cultivator
in the Ninth Heavens.

184
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,720
But since he tried to destroy
the Infinite Stele,

185
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,270
he was captured by you, Master,
and then imprisoned

186
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,750
in the Heavenly Punishment Platform
by the Heavenly Emissary.

187
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,880
Until three days ago, he was released.

188
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,790
I'm worried that this person still
harbors evil intentions,

189
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,720
and he might try to destroy
the Infinite Stele again.

190
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,480
Senior Puyuan, I think you're
overthinking this.

191
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,380
[Yongshou]

192
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,870
Master has already set up a barrier
on the Infinite Stele.

193
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,580
Even if there's the slightest disturbance,

194
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,000
Master would be able to sense it.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Of course I trust Master.

196
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,000
It's just I think sending more people
to guard it

197
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,530
would be more appropriate.

198
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,790
Someone has already been sent
to Tianmu Peak.

199
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,250
Which immortal lord is it?

200
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,480
Ning Yan and...

201
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,040
Li Qingyue.

202
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
Who is Ning Yan? And who is Li Qingyue?

203
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,030
Ning Yan seems to be a celestial attendant
taken in by Master.

204
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,390
As for this Li Qingyue,

205
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,470
I've never heard of her before, either.

206
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, um...

207
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,740
I heard a sound here,

208
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,940
so I came to check it out.

209
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,720
Who is this?

210
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,680
She is...

211
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,680
Heavenly Lord!

212
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,410
How dare you!

213
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,200
Who are you to intrude on
our morning meeting?

214
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,660
What are your intentions?

215
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,230
I have no intentions.

216
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,880
I just wanted to see the Heavenly Lord.

217
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,510
You think you can see His Lordship
whenever you want?

218
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,710
Get out now and accept your punishment!

219
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,050
I forgot to introduce.

220
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,290
This is my wife,

221
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,220
Li Qingyue.

222
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,420
So this is where you live, Heavenly Lord.

223
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,030
If I had known, I wouldn't have
wandered around.

224
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,630
I would have just waited here
for you to return.

225
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,270
You came all the way to Chongwu Hall.

226
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,000
It's because you want to show your face
in front of everyone

227
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,350
and make everyone aware
of your existence, isn't it?

228
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,400
That's not true.

229
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,170
I woke up and didn't know where I was.

230
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,510
So I wanted to find someone to ask,

231
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,310
but there wasn't a soul in sight.

232
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,410
That's how I accidentally ended up
at Chongwu Hall.

233
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,240
Yesterday, I was knocked out by
three stone men.

234
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,370
Was it you who saved me, Heavenly Lord?

235
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,610
Your injuries seem to have
healed quite quickly.

236
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,270
Thanks to the miraculous medicine
Master Dan Yang gave me earlier.

237
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,330
Otherwise, I definitely wouldn't
be able to get up now.

238
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,170
The Stone Forest isn't on the way
to Canglei Palace.

239
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,920
Why did you end up there?

240
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,070
I just followed Ning Yan's instructions

241
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,270
and kept going south.

242
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,940
Could it be I went in the wrong direction?

243
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,830
Those three stone men were
particularly unreasonable.

244
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,960
They attacked me as soon as they saw me.

245
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,160
Heavenly Lord, you didn't encounter
them, did you?

246
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,400
You're not hurt, are you?

247
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,960
No.

248
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,320
That's good.

249
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,200
Why did you come to Canglei Palace?

250
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,750
Heavenly Lord, you said before that
you don't wear clothes others have worn.

251
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,750
I specially bought a new set for you.

252
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,750
Unfortunately, I got locked up by
the Sect Leader before coming back.

253
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,590
So I never had the chance to
give them to you.

254
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,120
I don't wear clothes made
in the mortal world.

255
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,710
Then you'll definitely like this.

256
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,270
You said earlier that you wanted to eat
Xiaoqiu Berries.

257
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,730
So before I came this time,

258
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,110
I specially went to Xiaoqiu Mountain

259
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,170
and picked some fruits to bring over.

260
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,830
These are my favorite fruits.

261
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,790
Try some too.

262
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,810
Xiaoqiu Berries...

263
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,330
Using these old stories to provoke me,

264
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
is it fun?

265
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,560
What old stories?

266
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,840
Didn't you say you wanted to
eat Xiaoqiu Berries?

267
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,480
Heavenly Lord, what's wrong?

268
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,070
You came to find me

269
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,590
just to bring me some clothes
and Xiaoqiu Berries?

270
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,310
Of course not.

271
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,680
Heavenly Lord, don't you know

272
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,310
sleeping alone on the wedding night

273
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,640
can lead to marital discord in the future?

274
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,590
Oh no.

275
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,590
What now?

276
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,960
I passed out last night.

277
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,510
That already counts as sleeping alone.

278
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
I don't care, being unconscious
doesn't count as sleeping.

279
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Can we consider tonight as
the wedding night instead?

280
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,190
Sure.

281
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
That's about enough!

282
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,280
When we spar again next time,

283
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,280
if you still hold back like this,

284
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,660
there's no point in us sparring anymore.

285
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,510
Zhang Suan, you're being a bit too hasty.

286
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,720
The miraculous medicine given to you by
Heavenly Lady

287
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,350
could only strengthen your body,

288
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,350
but it failed to restore your qihai.

289
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,880
You should take it slow.

290
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,460
Master Dan Yang, your advice is correct.

291
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:27,960
Qingyue.

292
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,110
How are you doing on your own now?

293
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,800
Didn't you say you want to
consummate our marriage?

294
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,600
Wait a moment.

295
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,130
Are you scared?

296
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,080
Why don't you have any wine in your room?

297
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,640
What do we need wine for?

298
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,010
Isn't it customary to drink wedding wine
on the wedding night?

299
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,470
Why bother with all those formalities?

300
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,030
Isn't it better to just get started?

301

Is that important?

I just really want to know.

320
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,150
We're married now, so I don't need to
hide anything from you anymore.

321
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,730
When I was little, my family died
in a disaster.

322
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,200
To survive, I joined the Jingyun Sect.

323
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,880
Since my aptitude was so poor,

324
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,640
I was just idling away
in the Jingyun Sect.

325
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,330
All my life, I've always relied on myself.

326
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,210
No one has ever cared about me.

327
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,640
So when I got hurt,

328
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,880
I could only find medicine for myself.

329
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,560
There was no one to share my joy,
and no one to confide my sorrows.

330
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,310
I thought this was it for me
in this life.

331
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,550
But then, I met you, Heavenly Lord.

332
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,440
And now, when I fall off a cliff,
someone would come to save me.

333
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,500
When I'm wronged, someone would
stand up to protect me.

334
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,470
Even when I'm beaten unconscious,

335
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,080
someone would take me home.

336
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,110
For the first time in my life, I feel

337
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,680
I'm no longer alone.

338
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,750
I admit, Heavenly Lord, that

339
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,910
at first, I was only attracted
to your appearance.

340
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,080
But you kept protecting me
time and time again,

341
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,340
which made me see myself clearly.

342
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,920
Heavenly Lord, I really, really like you.

343
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,960
Alright, I'm thick-skinned.

344
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,620
I've said everything I wanted to say.

345
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,590
I know you're not good with words,
Heavenly Lord,

346
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,390
so I won't insist on getting
any response from you.

347
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,970
Let's get started then.

348
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,000
What?

349
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,700
Consummate our marriage, of course.

350
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,480
Are you scared, Heavenly Lord?

351
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,340
Where is he?

352
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,680
Why did I suddenly fall asleep last night?

353
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,040
Steward Cang.

354
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,440
Greetings, My Lady.

355
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,520
Why are you here?

356
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,830
His Lordship asked me to bring
you some food, My Lady.

357
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,540
This is too much. How can I eat it all?

358
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,140
This is for you to eat on the road,
My Lady.

359
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,100
On the road?

360
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,070
His Lordship said you've fulfilled
your wish, My Lady,

361
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,530
so it's time for you to
return to Tianmu Peak.

362
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,310
I have to go back there?

363
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,880
Of course. That is your
residence, My Lady.

364
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,540
It wasn't easy for me to come here.

365
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,520
Can't I stay for a few more days?

366
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,330
This is the rule of the divine race.

367
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,880
I hope you won't make it difficult
for His Lordship, My Lady.

368
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,270
What kind of rule separates newlyweds?

369
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,240
His Lordship asked me to tell you

370
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,790
not to wander around after getting back,
My Lady.

371
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,960
He will come to find you himself, My Lady.

372
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,550
What if he never comes to see me?

373
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,000
I can only wait and do nothing?

374
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,750
That's just how the rules are.

375
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,160
Being an immortal is truly difficult.

376
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,270
Once you've packed your things, My Lady,

377
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,400
I'll escort you out.

378
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,880
My Lord.

379
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,920
This is an invitation letter
sent by Fan Jiaojiao.

380
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,980
He's getting married again tonight.

381
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,840
He takes a new bride every year.
No need to pay attention to it.

382
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,620
Lady Qingyue has left.

383
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,040
The bait.

384
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,430
If you suspect Lady Qingyue, My Lord,

385
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,620
isn't it more reason for you
to keep her close by?

386
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,960
Or, is it because you've realized
you mistook her identity, My Lord?

387
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,560
There are countless fish
swimming in the pond.

388
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,790
Why did I catch this particular one?

389
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,210
This...

390
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,110
The karma of three lifetimes,
an unbroken cycle.

391
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,850
If it's meant to be her,

392
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,450
then so be it.

393
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,230
The fish will eventually
return to my pond.

394
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,290
Did I take a wrong turn?

395
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,600
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

396
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,240
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

397
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,360
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

398
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,730
[Map of Danxia Land]

399
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,970
Who's there?

400
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,550
Who are you?

401
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
Are you from around here?

402
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,110
I think I'm lost. Do you know the way?

403
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,600
Don't run away!

404
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,010
Hey, why did you run?

405
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,280
They... They're coming!

406
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,550
Who?

407
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,520
Who's coming?

408
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,389
Demons!

409
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,840
Demons? What demons?

410
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,670
Man-eating demons, lots and lots of them!

411
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Run! We must run!

412
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,010
Run! Run!

413
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,230
Don't...

414
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,150
Stop there.

415
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,510
You're here looking for someone, right?

416
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,360
She ran away in that direction.

417
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,870
By the way, could I ask you
for directions?

418
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,030
Is it her?

419
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,060
-Yes, it's her.
-No, it's not!

420
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,070
You've got the wrong person. It's not me.

421
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,140
It is her.

422
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,110
No, I'm...

423
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,190
Let's go.

424
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,280
Got it.

425
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,920
Play the music.

426
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,190
Lift the sedan chair!

427
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,230
Red attire tied with a knot of unity.

428
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,840
Green trees bloom with a thousand
layers of brocade.

429
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,670
Red thread embroiders the
shadows of two wild geese.

430
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,600
Colorful satin stitches the love
of mandarin ducks.

431
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Jade-like feet step out into
the scenery of Penglai.

432
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,160
Purple flute falls into the
Phoenix Tower.

433
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,530
Put on new makeup to welcome new joy.

434
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,470
Hairpins shake, black jade
shines doubly bright.

435
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,590
Bride.

436
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,280
Are you satisfied with your makeup?

437
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,400
Once the auspicious time arrives,
the wedding will begin.

438
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,030
No matter how scared you are, you can't
cry during the wedding.

439
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,960
If you cry, it will bring bad luck.

440
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,250
Do you understand?

441
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,700
Is everything ready?

442
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,600
Not bad.

443
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,730
Take good care of her.

444
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,720
I'll go ask the kitchen to hurry up.

445
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,950
Your family has been paid.

446
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,870
Besides, I've already told you,

447
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,110
I won't let anything happen to you.

448
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,390
What's not good about being my wife?

449
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,480
What else is there to think about?

450
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,700
My Lord, it's time.

451
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,150
Shall we get going?

452
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,720
Let's go.

453
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,440
Let's go.

454
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,000
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

455
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,960
The auspicious time has arrived!

456
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,000
The newlyweds have arrived.
Let the feast begin!

457
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,270
First bow to the heavens.

458
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,150
On this auspicious day and hour,
heaven and earth are in harmony.

459
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,630
Second bow to the earth.

460
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,580
Yin and yang unite, bringing good fortune
in all four seasons.

461
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,170
Third bow to each other.

462
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,860
Great wealth, great nobility, great
fortune, and great prosperity.

463
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,410
Great wealth, great nobility, great
fortune, and great prosperity.

464
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,300
Heavenly Lord...

465
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,110
Heavenly Lord!
