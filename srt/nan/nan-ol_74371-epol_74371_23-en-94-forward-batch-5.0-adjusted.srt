00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,900
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,039
Your Majesty,

4
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,920
if I win, I'll ask for nothing

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,080
but

6
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,720
a marriage to Young Marshal Yan.

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,070
Princess Yuanwu, watch your words.

8
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,840
We've never met before.

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,039
How can I marry you?

10
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,710
Yan Chi,

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,600
do you really not remember me?

12
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,210
When you patrolled the borders in Shuoxi,

13
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,210
did you save

14
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,200
a Beidai soldier
captured by the nomadic enemy?

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,890
I've saved countless lives.

16
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,200
I can't remember them all.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,320
You led a troop in person

18
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,070
to escort me back
to the borders of Beidai.

19
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,600
How could you not remember me?

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,759
Take a good look at me.

21
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,600
I was patrolling the borders
with a troop at that time.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
I thought you were a young soldier,

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,350
so I escorted you back on my way.

24
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,050
Had I known you were a princess,

25
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,310
I wouldn't have made that rash decision.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,740
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,829
whether Young Marshal Yan agrees or not,

28
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,579
today,

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,230
I must get engaged to him.

30
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,810
No way.

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,960
Why?

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,440
Am I not good enough for you?

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,150
First,

34
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,950
I will only take

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,060
the woman I love as my wife,

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,200
but you are not her.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,720
Second,

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,390
with me here,

39
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,390
you won't win the archery contest.

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,000
I love you with all my heart.

41
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,440
How can you humiliate me like this?

42
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,550
Wu!

43
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,690
This is enough.

44
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,380
Father,

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,880
the plum blossoms are blooming
in the Southern Court now.

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,920
Why not invite

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
the princes and princesses

48
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,340
from Beidai and Xihan to have fun there

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,280
and practice mounted archery?

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,950
It's a good way to celebrate the New Year

51
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,600
and strengthen the friendship
among the three countries.

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,060
What do you think, Father?

53
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,000
Father.

54
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,320
Qi prioritizes his personal safety

55
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,480
and seldom goes for an outing.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,110
I concur in his suggestion.

57
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,440
Then I approve of this proposal.

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,790
Crown Prince, make sure
everyone stays safe.

59
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,510
Do not act recklessly.

60
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,860
As you command, Father.

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,070
Little Wan'er,

62
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,670
what if the Emperor

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
really orders Chi
to marry Princess Yuan Wu?

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,610
I only care about his reaction.

65
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,110
As for what the others do,

66
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,440
it's none of my concern.

67
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,130
Chi, what are you doing?

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,230
I'm going after Wan.

69
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,400
You can't go!

70
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,960
Mrs. Qin and Qin Zhaoyu are
both in the carriage.

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,220
What can you do
when you catch up with her?

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,230
Was Wan upset?

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,700
Who wouldn't be upset

74
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,540
by Yuan Wu's nonsense?

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,310
But I already declined her on the spot.

76
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,990
What difference could that make?

77
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,190
As Little Wan'er said,

78
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,400
if the Emperor

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,159
grants Yuan Wu's wish for the harmony
between Beidai and our country,

80
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,020
are you going to defy His Majesty?

81
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,420
In that case,

82
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,430
I'll have to disobey His Majesty.

83
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,360
Little Wan'er said one more thing!

84
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,230
What was it?

85
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,480
Little Wan'er said,

86
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,040
as the illustrious Heir of Prince Rui,

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,430
you should prioritize state affairs.

88
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,080
How could she let
the romance between you two

89
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,940
ruin your hard-earned prestige?

90
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,870
Therefore...

91
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,840
What?

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,870
Take me on the outing
the day after tomorrow,

93
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,330
and I'll tell you the rest!

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,450
Not a chance.

95
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,420
You...

96
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,240
Chi!

97
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,140
Agree to it before you go!

98
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,850
I know how to stuff you into the event.

99
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Who are you?

100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,450
I don't know you.

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,170
Didn't you just pretend not to know me?

102
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,520
Now you're trying to sweet talk me.

103
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,780
Don't believe me then.

104
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,040
I'll give you a chance!

105
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,960
Wan, as you could see

106
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,870
in today's royal banquet,

107
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,720
the envoys of Xihan and Beidai
paid this visit with the purpose of

108
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,920
building a marriage alliance
through Princess Zhen.

109
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,250
Whichever of them gets the satisfaction,

110
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,400
long-lasting and friendly
diplomatic ties will be formed.

111
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,600
However, the Emperor and the Empress
have only one daughter.

112
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,190
Even if they can bring themselves
to marry the princess to a distant land,

113
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,640
between the third prince of Xihan
and the Crown Prince of Beidai,

114
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,900
only one can be Princess Chen's husband.

115
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,080
The other one

116
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,410
will surely marry a girl
from the royal family or a noble one.

117
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,160
What are you suggesting, Aunt?

118
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,110
Though Beidai and Xihan are
far away from home,

119
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,160
the royal families there
still hold supreme positions.

120
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,870
If you marry into
either of these countries,

121
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,990
our entire nation will be
grateful for your contribution.

122
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,120
What do you think?

123
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,190
Is it Uncle's idea too?

124
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,550
It's your marriage we're talking about.

125
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,480
Your opinion is valued, of course.

126
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,430
If you're interested,

127
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,480
I'll tell your uncle
right after we get home.

128
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,310
I am not

129
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,370
interested at all.

130
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,520
Yu, thank you for looking out for me.

131
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,790
Glorious though the bride

132
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,600
of a marriage alliance seems,

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,080
misery is always hidden deep inside.

134
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,640
Besides, fame and wealth are not

135
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,990
what I pursue.

136
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,550
Don't bother to make any efforts for me
in that respect, Aunt, Yu.

137
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,720
Wan, you truly have
a pure and uncorrupted heart.

138
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,870
What you think and pursue is
unconventional.

139
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,240
How flattering, Yu.

140
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,430
But I'm exactly the opposite of that.

141
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,560
Practical benefits matter more to me.

142
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,490
My Lady,

143
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,800
don't mind me being nosy.

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,110
I think it's better sooner than later

145
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,960
for Lord Yan and you to get married.

146
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,020
Don't just let the matter hang there.

147
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,670
This time, a Beidai princess
proposed to Lord Yan.

148
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,640
What if a Xihan princess does the same

149
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,660
next time?

150
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,660
If I marry him so soon,

151
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,350
there will likely be controversies

152
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,080
when I investigate cases in the future.

153
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,350
Doubtlessly, some people will say

154
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,790
Chi is the reason that I can come and go

155
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,250
through the Ministry of Justice
as I please.

156
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,400
Then, how am I supposed to
convince everyone of

157
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,840
my father's innocence?

158
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,040
What's more,

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,750
Chi came back to the capital not long ago.

160
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,600
Many uncertainties are lying ahead.

161
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,060
I can't distract him
with our relationship.

162
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,190
But you have to settle it someday, right?

163
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,870
By that, you mean a mere verbal promise.

164
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,880
For a faithful partner,

165
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,350
his every action represents a commitment.

166
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,720
For an unfaithful partner,

167
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,520
even the solemnest vows can't stop him

168
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,650
from backtracking.

169
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,430
I'll let nature take its course

170
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,760
and not force anything.

171
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,480
I can't be as assured as you are.

172
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,080
What?

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,960
You can't wait to marry Bai Feng anymore?

174
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
Wait. We're talking about you.

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,510
Why am I the subject now?

176
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,520
You two are not constrained by anything.

177
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,960
If you're sure he's the one,

178
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
just marry him.

179
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,480
No!

180
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,520
Before you marry Lord Yan,

181
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,669
I'll keep you company

182
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,549
and never leave you alone.

183
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,280
Don't worry.

184
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,020
I'll make sure

185
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,570
your wedding is grand and splendid.

186
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,440
That's my "faithful partner."

187

What's the name of this lake?

188
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,430
I discovered this place by chance.

189
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,630
Since then, I've often come here alone.

190
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,430
You're the first one
I've taken on a boat trip here.

191
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,750
You once brought
Princess Yuan Wu back to Beidai.

192
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,950
Doesn't that count as a trip with a girl?

193
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,600
How I wish Yuan Wu had shown up earlier.

194
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,450
What do you mean?

195
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,120
If she had shown up earlier,

196
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,760
I would've seen you

197
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,430
getting jealous sooner.

198
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,710
Nonsense.

199
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,120
I'm not jealous at all.

200
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,430
Princess Yuan Wu is
exceptionally beautiful.

201
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,550
Did you really not realize
she was a woman?

202

I found no one but you
exceptionally beautiful—

Why don't we come back here tomorrow?

No, tomorrow will be too late.

For as long as I can remember,

246
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,530
I've been practicing martial arts

247
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,130
and never taken a day of rest.

248
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,640
But when my father was little,

249
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,300
he worked even harder than me.

250
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,890
Only he is the unrivaled god of war
in my heart.

251
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,310
The late Emperor once intended to
make my father the Crown Prince,

252
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,070
but my father
had no desire for the throne,

253
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,190
worrying that the conflicts among brothers

254
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,760
would upset the Empress Dowager.

255
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,820
So, he volunteered to move to Shuoxi.

256
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,280
The current Emperor

257
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,760
was thus able to take the throne.

258

Does His Majesty know about this?

259
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,360
Whether he knows it or not
doesn't matter anymore.

260

After my mother's passing,

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,120
my father resists the idea of

due to lack of management.

265
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,110
Then your stay in the capital...

266
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,490
In my father's eyes,

267
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm a mere hostage being kept here
to set the Emperor's mind at ease.

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,100
But he has no idea

269
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,470
that the volatile political arena is

270
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,950
a battlefield
where killings happen without blood.

271
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,080
Living in isolation

272
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,400
will only lead to the destruction of

ourselves and the Shuoxi Army.

274

I must stay in the capital
to break this deadlock.

275
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,550
It's the only way to secure a future
for the Shuoxi Army.

Why didn't you confide in Prince Rui?

335
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,710
N-No need, Your Ladyship.

336
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,760
I just...

337
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,590
need to visit the washroom.

338
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,190
Then give me the wine.

339
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,240
I'll bring it to the outer study
on my own.

340
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,120
Many thanks, Your Ladyship.

341
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,850
The outer study is right ahead.

342
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,880
Who on earth is this visitor
in the outer study?

343
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,920
Even the distinguished Mrs. Qin

344
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,520
felt compelled to resort to
such a lousy trick.

345
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

346
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,520
What are you doing here?

347
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,190
Bringing wine over on my aunt's behalf.

348
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,790
I'd hate to disturb Your Highness.

349
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,250
Now, I shall take my leave.

350
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,040
Take your wine with you.

351
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,280
I reject wine from unidentified sources.

352
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,820
What does Your Highness mean?

353
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
You rose to fame as a medical fairy

354
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,950
with your own efforts.

355
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,530
Is that not enough for you?

356
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,599
Miss Qin, you'd better not

357
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,060
covet what doesn't belong to you.

358
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,690
Insatiable people always

359
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,140
end up eating their own bitter fruit.

360
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,890
Well said, Your Highness.

361
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,670
People reap

362
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,270
what they sow.

363
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,319
I know perfectly well what's on your mind,

364
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,190
so stop this little word game.

365
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,430
The marquis always dismisses

366
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,090
all the servants in and outside the study
when I come here.

367
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,550
Only authorized personnel have the access.

368
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,320
If you weren't trying to seduce me,

369
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,980
why would you come here alone?

370
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,730
If you conducted

371
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,270
such a noxious and disgraceful act
at my place,

372
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,750
you would've been sent to
the Division of Penalty already.

373
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,350
Does Your Highness think

374
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,260
I'm here to seduce you?

375
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,290
What gives Your Highness the idea

376
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,890
that every woman in the world

377
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,500
desperately desires you?

378
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,560
How dare you!

379
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,130
Thank you for the compliment,
Your Highness.

380
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,080
Shameless!

381
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,030
You have no shame at all!

382
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,220
Your Highness,

383
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,990
what...

384
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,190
happened?

385
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,810
Mr. Qin,

386
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,750
why hasn't that excellent coroner

387
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,270
you talked about arrived yet?

388
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,490
He had better be here now.

389
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,950
Or I'm leaving right away.

390
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,050
Your Highness,

391
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,180
you already met the coroner, didn't you?

392
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,420
She's the coroner?

393
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,960
Shouldn't it be a young man?

394
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,470
To conceal her real identity,

395
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,320
Wan sometimes disguises as a man.

396
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,470
The capital prefect knows it too.

397
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,080
So, Miss Qin came here to...

398
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
Your Highness is in our humble abode.

399
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,090
How could she not come
to greet Your Highness?

400
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,330
Then the wine...

401
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,410
Aunt had guests to entertain,

402
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,270
so she asked me to bring the wine over.

403
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,670
Food will be served soon.

404
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,720
Miss Qin,

405
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,320
just now...

406
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,710
We've cleared the air already.

407
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,950
Your Highness, just forget what happened.

408
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,320
I need to set out for the palace
to treat the Empress Dowager.

409
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,780
I have to take my leave now.

410
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,600
You brought me here
only to show me these?

411
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,730
Wan is rewarded with these many gifts.

412
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,930
We should be here to congratulate her.

413
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,920
Xiang, look!

414
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,920
Each of these pearls gifted by the Empress

415
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,230
is as big as a pigeon's egg!

416
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,710
How's that a surprise?

417
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,360
Little Wan'er saved Grandmother's life.

418
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,220
There's no reward too big for her.

419
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,500
How things have changed!

420
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,770
Seeing Wan at the height of her glory,

421
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,510
who would believe
she once knelt before the old house,

422
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,080
looking all shabby and ragged?

423
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,990
Xiang, why do you have to bring that up?

424
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,100
What can't I say?

425
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,670
I haven't got started on
her cancelled engagement yet.

426
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,070
Lady Xiang,
you're getting out of the line!

427
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,640
How dare you yell at me, lowly maid!

428
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,110
Xiang!

429
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,510
Get out!

430
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
She's the one who disrespected me.

431
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,170
Why is Your Highness scolding me instead?

432
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,130
Because you're not welcome here.

433
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,560
Wan, you befriended
the royalty not long ago.

434
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,360
Are we, your own sisters,
already eyesores to you?

435
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,510
Shuang isn't,

436
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,470
but you are.

437
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,070
That's right.

438
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,110
Given what you said just now,

439
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,030
do you expect anyone to like you?

440
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,880
Dream on!

441
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,840
Xiang...

442
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,850
Your Highness, Wan,

443
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,980
Xiang has been spoiled by Mother.

444
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,540
Please don't be mad at her.

445
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,190
Xiang hates to be outshined.

446
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,470
It's understandable.

447
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,700
But her stubbornness

448
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
might cost her dearly in the future.

449
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,220
I hope she'll come to her senses soon.

450
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,330
Fuling,

451
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,600
pack up some jewelry from the palace

452
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,750
for Shuang.

453
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,230
Got it.

454
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,120
No, no.

455
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,470
These items are too valuable.

456
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,670
I shouldn't take any.

457
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,270
Just accept them.

458
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,600
Anyway, Little Wan'er

459
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
never wears these fancy trinkets.

460
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,090
Wan,

461
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,880
I acted silly before

462
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
and put you through many hard times.

463
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,200
I...

464
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,510
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

465
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,270
But if you still consider me your sister,

466
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,360
I'll prove my care for you with action.

467
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
You've never caused any real harm to me.

468
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,990
What is there to forgive?

469
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,190
Alright, enough.

470
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,880
Save it for later, you two loving sisters.

471
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,470
The Empress Dowager is
waiting for medical treatment.

472
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,560
We have to set out for the palace now.

473
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,320
That's right.

474
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,510
Wan, go do your job.

475
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,800
I'll try to persuade Xiang

476
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,660
not to cause you trouble anymore.

477
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,430
Shuang,

478
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,530
you seem more and more
like a real sweetheart now.

479
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,360
And you are sounding
more and more like Yan Li.

480
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,960
It's exactly the other way around!

481
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,950
Alright. Come on.

482
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,880
It's time to go to the palace.

483
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,840
Get changed now.

484
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,470
-Honey...
-Listen.

485
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,510
Why was it

486
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,970
Qin Wan who sent the wine
to the Crown Prince?

487
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,120
Well, when I rushed to the storeroom,

488
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,510
Wan happened to...

489
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,840
Still denying it?

490
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,800
Calm down, Father.

491
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,130
That was my idea.

492
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,030
Mother did the work

493
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,370
out of love for me.

494
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,710
Please don't blame her, Father.

495
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,150
Where was that idea from?

496
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,670
The selection of the Crown Princess is
approaching.

497
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,400
Out of fear of accidents,

498
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,710
I decided to give Wan a little test,

499
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
in case I had to take precautions.

500
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,470
How foolish!

501
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:29,920
I...

502
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,430
Yu!

503
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,860
Do you know what you did today

504
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,400
almost ruined Father's master plan?

505
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,060
I don't understand, Yan.

506
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,190
Though Wan is credited with
curing the Empress Dowager,

507
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,430
she is still a parentless girl
under our protection.

508
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,990
How is she able to make a real difference?

509
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,320
Yu, let me tell you something.

510
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,270
The Crown Prince

511
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,330
-already...
-Yan.

512
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,430
I've told you

513
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,230
today's Crown Princess will be
tomorrow's Empress.

514
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,400
The selection of the Crown Princess is

515
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,730
not only a state affair,

516
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,320
but also a matter concerning

517
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,360
the rise and fall of the Qin family.

518
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,200
Any immature acts would be detrimental.

519
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,840
If the Empress and the Crown Prince
learn of what you did today,

520
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,560
will they still choose you
as the Crown Princess?

521
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,510
Honey...

522
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,990
We can't let the worst happen!

523
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,160
If you still want your daughter

524
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,890
to become the future Empress,

525
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,980
then stop encouraging her

526
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,510
to do anything silly like this!

527
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,760
Father,

528
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,490
I shall obey.

529
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,910
Yu...

530
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,780
All I want

531
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,560
is to be his wife.

♪ Endless wind and rain ♪

534
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,990
The meritorious official Yan Han,

535
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,840
though once deceived
by the traitor Fu Chengye,

536
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,470
chose to uphold justice
over assisting the evil.

537
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,560
He rescued me from a dire situation
at the Storm Ridge.

538
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,320
For that, he sacrificed his life
without hesitation.

♪ What a pity ♪

540
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,800
Therefore, I now bestow upon him
the title of Prince Yi,

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,270
reward him with a mansion

542

and have his contributions recorded.

543
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,670
Thus it is decreed.

Your Highnesses,

Madam is praying to the Buddha.

554
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
She won't receive visitors.

555
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,600
These two bracelets have been

556
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,400
placed before the Buddha for many days.

557
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,190
Madam means for them
as gifts for Your Highnesses.

558
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,600
May Your Highnesses be
bosom friends forever

559
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,510
and enjoy a lifetime of wellness.

560
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,790
Thank you, Madam.

561
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,920
I wish you longevity

562
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,530
and happiness, Madam.

563
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,560
Chi,

564
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,120
what does my mother mean by this?

565
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,190
You and I are already close like brothers.

566
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,360
Why would she wish us

567
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,070
to be bosom friends forever?

568
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,290
Seeing you stir up trouble everywhere,

569
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,510
perhaps she is worried

570
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,800
that you might lose
my friendship and support.

571
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,320
My mother is worried about nothing.

572
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,430
You and I will never drift apart,

573
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:20,980
right?

574
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,040
Of course.

575
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,870
What a nice bracelet.

576
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
A new year has just begun.

577
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,640
Why am I sensing

578
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,230
a risk of self-harm from Madam's words?

579
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

580
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,190
I wish you longevity, Empress Dowager.

581
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,720
May you be well, Empress.

582
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,410
The Empress Dowager
has been waiting for you.

583
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,880
Has Her Majesty eaten breakfast yet?

584
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,750
Her Majesty said she was hungry
as she woke up this morning.

585
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,750
Then she ate half a bowl of porridge.

586
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,740
The Grand Princess was not
exaggerating it at all.

587
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,160
Miss Qin truly has
remarkable medical skills.

588
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,120
Thanks to Your Majesty's wise decision
to recognize talent

589
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,470
and the luck that the Empress Dowager
and the Grand Princess are blessed with,

590
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,270
Miss Qin has a chance to demonstrate
her miraculous medical skills.

591
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,120
Your Majesty,

592
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,560
Miss Qin is taking Mother's pulse now.

593
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,290
We should keep our voices down,

594
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,420
so Mother won't be disturbed.

595
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
Okay.

596
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,880
How thoughtful of you.

597
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,320
Let me take a good look at you.

598
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,800
It was you who saved my life?

599
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,120
All because of
His Majesty's wise decision,

600
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,800
I was able to focus on
treating Your Majesty with all my might.

601
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,200
The Emperor's filial piety
and your medical competence were

602
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,910
both indispensable.

603
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,710
Your Majesty was struck
by an acute illness,

604
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,230
but has fortunately received
timely treatment.

605
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,030
Your Majesty will make a full recovery
in just a few days.

606
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,900
However, this condition
could easily relapse.

607
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,880
Your Majesty must stay emotionally stable

608
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,360
and maintain a calm mind.

609
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,770
Try to stay away from anxiety and worry.

610
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,710
I will do everything as you said,

611
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,710
but I can't refrain myself

612
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,480
from feeling worried.

613
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,230
Mother,

614
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,840
if there are any challenges or problems,

615
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,950
leave them to me.

616
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,670
You must heed the medical fairy's advice.

617
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,430
Look,

618
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,700
you have a little helper now.

619
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,190
Your Majesty,

620
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,880
the Empress Dowager's condition
has stabilized.

621
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,190
She will recover after
a five or six days' medication

622
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,920
according to my prescription.

623
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,570
The gifts I gave you yesterday

624
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,010
may not be entirely to your liking.

625
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,190
Tell me, what would you like today?

626
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,950
I have no interest in luxuries.

627
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,400
But I do want a favor from Your Majesty.

628
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,600
A favor?

629
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,880
Speak your mind.

630
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,270
I implore Your Majesty

631
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,470
to allow Princess Yongning
to attend tomorrow's outing.

632
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,870
What a coincidence.

633
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,360
Someone is asking for the same thing.

634
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,230
Those waiting outside,

635
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,960
come on in!

636
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,860
We wish Your Majesty all the best.

637
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,740
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

638
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,080
Little rascals,

639
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,190
why are you hiding behind Chi?

640
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,970
Rise,

641
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,220
all of you.

642
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,600
Thank Your Majesty.

643
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,750
How perceptive of Your Majesty.

644
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,680
They two

645
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,400
are using me as a shield.

646
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,410
Chi,

647
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,570
didn't you promise not to sell me out?

648
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,980
It turns out you asked Chi for help.

649
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,320
You lied to me again.

650
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,730
I'll note this one down.

651
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,670
Sui,

652
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,400
come here.

653
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,540
Come to Father.

Answer me.

00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,070
Have you done any study in recent days?

657
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,560
Ma'am Chen,

658
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,190
does he still refuse to talk now?

659
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,390
Yes.

660
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,510
Emperor, go do your work.

661
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,050
I'm tired.

662
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,990
I'd like to rest.

663

Let Sui stay with me.

664
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,430
Come on,

665
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,430
come here.

666
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,750
Fine.

667
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,190
I've been here for some time.

668
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,620
You surely needs

669
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,600
a rest now, Mother.

670
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,200
Come here.

671
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,320
Ning,

672
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,980
Miss Qin and Chi

673
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,710
have both asked me to do you a favor.

674
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,080
You can attend

675
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,360
the outing tomorrow.

676
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,160
Thank Your Majesty.

677
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,840
Li,

678
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,360
didn't you just suggest the same thing?

679
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,510
You shall keep Ning company

680
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,770
and ensure her safety.

681
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,430
See,

682
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,130
I just invited trouble.

683
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,670
Thank Your Majesty.

684
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,790
Chi, spare yourself from the outing,

685
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,290
in case that princess from Beidai
creates problems again.

686
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,190
Yes.

687
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,710
Mother.

688
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,890
Take a good rest.

689
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,870
I shall take my leave now.

690
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,840
At lunch time,

691
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,390
I'll come visit you again.

692
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,270
Meet me in Zichen Hall later.

693
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,170
I need a word with you.

694
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,070
Yes.

695
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,750
Go ahead.

696
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,950
-Come here.
-Careful.

697
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,620
Don't worry.

698
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,990
Grandmother is much better now.

699
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,850
I'm all fine.

700
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,680
Sui's mother is Consort Jin.

701
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,990
On the day of Consort Jin's death,

702
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,520
he was in Hanguang Hall too.

703
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,580
Grandmother is tired.

704
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,990
Shall we set off firecrackers together?

705
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,740
Go play.

706
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,900
Just remember to keep yourself safe.

707
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,550
Let's go set off some firecrackers!

708
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,540
Come on.

709
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,430
Ma'am Chen,

710
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,750
Sui used to be a naughty little boy.

711
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,680
Why is he so quiet and reserved now?

712
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,740
Well...

713
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,840
The Emperor forbids
any discussion about it.

714
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,620
Since Consort Jin's passing,

715
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,230
Sui hasn't spoken a word.

716
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,160
Your Majesty...

717
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,610
Miss Qin is the Grand Princess's
god-granddaughter.

718
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,800
She risked her life to save mine.

719
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,480
She is not just a random girl.

720
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,740
The Emperor doesn't give
much attention to Sui.

721
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,480
Try teaching him something
in your spare time.

722
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,560
He needs a better caregiver than me,
a mere woman.

723
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,490
I'll do what I can, Grandmother.

724
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,250
By the way,

725
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,670
don't tell your father

726
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,510
about my illness.

727
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,150
He's in the far-away border area,

728
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,760
with heavy responsibilities
on his shoulders.

729
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,880
Even if he knows about my condition,

730
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,480
he won't be able to come back.

731
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,630
Why not spare him from worries?

732
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,949
I understand.

733
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,420
Grandmother, get well soon.

734
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,280
Don't worry about these matters.

735
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,840
Okay.

736
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,170
Tomorrow,

737
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,239
Physician Zhang and Physician Lin
will tag along in the outing,

738
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,440
in case of emergency.

739
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,590
Miss Qin,

740
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,429
can you pay daily visits
to the Empress Dowager?

741
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,150
Sure.

742
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,150
This is my duty as a doctor.

743
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,030
You'll come here every day?

744
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,590
That's perfect.

745
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,010
I'd love to spend more time with you

746
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,920
to make my sister-in-law jealous,

747
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,610
so she'll come to the capital
to visit me sooner.

748
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,360
Chi,

749
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,760
what are you looking at?

750
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,630
Go to Zichen Hall now.

751
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,360
The Emperor is waiting for you.

752
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,840
Yes.

753
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,470
Since you're staying in the capital now,

754
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,380
try your best to assist him.

755
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,530
These years

756
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,780
haven't been easy for him.

757
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,390
I got it.

758
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,170
I entrust Grandmother to your care then,
Miss Qin.

759
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,470
Rest assured, Your Highness.

760
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,110
I won't fail your trust.

761
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,200
The plum forest in the Southern Court is
hundreds of years old.

762
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,660
Please feel free to visit
that lovely place.

763
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,110
Practices of mounted archery are
scheduled for later.

764
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,630
You'll have a chance
to demonstrate your skills.

765
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,470
How considerate of Your Highness.

766
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,920
Winter in Beidai is freezing cold.

767
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,880
Yet the landscapes here are idyllic,

768
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,010
which is quite rare.

769
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,070
In my opinion,

770
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,730
where there is Princess Zhen,

771
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,110
there is

772
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,470
a beautiful view.

773
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,240
Anyone who finds the scenery
short of satisfaction

774
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,630
may follow me to the woods

775
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,290
to practice mounted archery.

776
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,950
It'll be fun as well.

777
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,520
Crown Prince,

778
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,950
you've finally said something sensible.

779
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,510
The princes of Beidai and Xihan are
on today's outing.

780
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,990
Appreciating the scenery
and composing poems are

781
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,950
hardly enough
to showcase their masculinity.

782
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,880
Mounted archery is
a much more refreshing activity.

783
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,960
Crown Prince, no need to fear

784
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,430
that you're an inferior archer to others.

785
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,030
I'll let you win a few rounds.

786
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,510
The spotlight will be yours.

787
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,120
That won't be necessary.

788
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,400
I'm the Crown Prince of our country.

789
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,470
I don't need extra glory,

790
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,150
since I already have much.

791
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,590
I'd rather spend the time

792
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,430
reading a few more nice books.

793
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
That seems more enjoyable to me.

794
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,210
You're truly elegant and refined,
Crown Prince.

795
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,320
I can't hold a candle to you.

796
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,420
How I wish

797
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,760
I could have a mother

798
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,370
as privileged as yours.

799
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,320
You see, I have to fight

800
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,880
for my own glory.

801
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,120
Instead of whining about
the differences in our origins,

802
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,470
maybe you should consider

803
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,470
how to properly entertain
our distinguished guests.

804
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,350
Everyone, please follow me
to the plum forest.

805
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:43,760
Please.

806
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,760
Let's go.

807
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,430
I'd rather not.

808
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,070
I want to appreciate
the spring scenery here.

809
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,400
Except for this plum forest,

810
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,550
all looks desolate.

811
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,210
What spring scenery is there?

812
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,920
This snow fox...

813
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,380
Spring has come. It's mating season again.

814
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,470
You are

815
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,400
so mean.

816
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,580
Let's go.

817
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,070
Thank you.

818
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,620
Goodbye.

819
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,920
Miss Qin, help!

820
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,320
Princess Yuan Wu got injured
in the Southern Court.

821
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,590
Please go help her, Miss Qin.

822
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,680
There are royal physicians
in the Southern Court.

823
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,020
Why not seek their help?

824
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,320
Princess Yuan Wu thought

825
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,390
Young Marshal Yan would be
on the outing too.

826
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,840
But she didn't see him
in the Southern Court.

827
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,880
Then she decided to come back here
on an impulse.

828
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,280
Upon reaching the capital,

829
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,240
her horse got startled

830
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,410
and shook her off.

831
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,280
She's been in a coma since then.

832
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,950
She got injured
on her way back to the capital.

833
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,630
Why didn't you bring her
to the palace for treatment?

834
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,720
Not knowing where the injury is,

835
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,550
we didn't dare to move her.

836
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,110
Her Highness is a royal princess.

837
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,630
It's appropriate for men to treat her.

838
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,590
So, I have no option

839
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,990
but to ask you for help, Medical Fairy.

840
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,480
Do you think I'd believe you?

841
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,720
Princess Yuan Wu always acts recklessly.

842
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,510
We've advised her many times,
but she wouldn't listen.

843
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,160
I completely understand

844
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,720
why you don't want to help her.

845
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,650
However,

846
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,340
this matter concerns
our two countries' diplomatic relations.

847
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,220
If anything happens to Princess Yuan Wu,

848
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,630
the Crown Prince of your country
and Young Marshal Yan

849
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,030
will be both held liable.

850
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,510
Where is Princess Yuan Wu?

851
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,630
Here I am.
