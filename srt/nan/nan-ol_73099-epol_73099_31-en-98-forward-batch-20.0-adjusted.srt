[Episode 31]

3
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,140
I am in love with Senior Meng.

4
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,780
But don't you think you've belittled me?

5
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,340
My love is not that shallow.

6
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,840
Senior,

7
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,070
the people of the Yinlian Sect have all
been bewitched by the Blood Chime.

8
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,470
No medicine can fix them.

9
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,820
To save them

10
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,940
and return to the Jingyun Sect,

11
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,450
I had to pretend to collude with him

12
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,110
so as to seize the Blood Chime.

13
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,579
Now that he has destroyed the Blood Chime,

14
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,230
the disciples of the Yinlian Sect
will be fine.

15
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,700
You ungrateful wretches,

16
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,990
in this case,

17
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,240
I'll just wipe you all out

18
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,060
and then go find the Qiyue Sword.

19
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,750
Elder,

20
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,710
you leave with the Qiyue Sword first.

21
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,770
We'll hold him off.

22
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,300
In no case can we let him
seize the Qiyue Sword.

23
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Chant to set up

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,860
the formation!

25
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,620
Elder?

26
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,790
Focus your energy.

27
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,240
This is our last stand!

28
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,060
Yes!

29
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,890
If you keep resisting,

30
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,230
none of you will survive.

31
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,840
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Jiang Bian,
am willing to die for it!

32
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Gong Liangyu,
am willing to die for it!

33
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,620
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Fang Cai,
am willing to die for it!

34
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,829
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Qin Guan,
am willing to die for it!

35
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:42,950
I, Qu Yunxu!

36
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,190
I, Duan Qinghong!

37
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,580
I, Tong Mingyue!

38
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,680
I, Zhou Tong!

39
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,980
I, Pei Wenjie!

40
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,130
I, Wang Haoyu!

41
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,130
I, Duan Qianqiu!

42
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,100
I, Chen Mu!

43
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,150
I, Du Yunchuan!

44
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,370
I, Wang Baoxing!

45
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,870
I, Liu Chushuo!

46
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,830
Willing to die for it!

47
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,840
Junior...

48
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,660
Are you alright?

49
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,720
Senior.

50
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,840
Don't be afraid.

51
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,830
What Qu Xingman

52
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,540
took was

53
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,870
a death-feigning potion.

54
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,190
I know.

55
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,620
I know, Junior.

56
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,000
Junior,

57
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,550
you will be fine.

58
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,659
Junior.

59
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,310
Junior!

60
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,520
Why bother making futile struggles?

61
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,330
You must have divined and learned

62
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,590
that you can't stop me.

63
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,380
So,

64
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,550
still not quit resisting?

65
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,880
Elder,

66
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,730
we can't give him the sword.

67
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,270
People

68
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,850
should yield to their fate

69
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
and not make pointless resistance.

70
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,610
Your sect could have

71
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,910
had a few more survivals.

72
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:00,630
These demonic beasts are trying to escape!

73
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,730
We must stop them!

74
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,090
Otherwise, the mortal realm will suffer!

75
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,980
Li Mo,

76
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,470
what are you going to do?

77
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,810
Senior, you're right.

78
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,400
We can't let these demonic beasts
leave Danxia Land.

79
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,080
Li Mo,

80
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,630
what are you planning to do?

81
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,890
Even if you self-destruct
your primordial spirit,

82
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,640
you still can't annihilate
those demonic beasts!

83
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,470
Don't!

84
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,020
My cultivation path
is different from yours.

85
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,580
With countless merits,

86
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,320
only I

87
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,750
can stop them.

88
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,260
You can't do this!

89
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,380
No!

90
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,170
If there's a next life,

91
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,150
I promise

92
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,880
to care for you only.

93
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,680
Li Mo.

94
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,140
Li Mo!

95
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,030
You vile beast.

96
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,710
You should have died long ago.

97
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,980
Who are you?

98
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,580
Your daughter is in danger.

99
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,260
Where is Ling'er?

100
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,880
Zhang Suan.

101
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,930
Is there really nothing we can do?

102
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,490
Then I'll go find Xiao Jingshan.

103
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,560
This is the magical artifact he forged.

104
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,020
He must know how to undo it.

105
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,990
Aren't you going to find the Divine Lord?

106
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,700
She has Bai Jiusi with her.

107
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,720
You're in graver danger than her.

108
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,940
Don't go.

109
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,600
For this last bit of time,

110
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,890
just stay with me for a while.

111
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
The people have all been evacuated.

112
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,040
Without souls to nourish the Joy Stele,

113
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,110
the illusion it created

114
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,140
will collapse.

115
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,250
The formation's eye will also
vanish with it.

116
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,950
Ling'er!

117
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,720
Ling'er!

118
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,090
Ling'er!

119
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,960
Ling'er.

120
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,200
Ling'er.

121
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,840
I was wrong.

122
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,550
Come out, okay?

123
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,610
Don't be stubborn.

124
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,810
Come out now.

125
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,650
You know what?

126
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,480
If I had spiritual energy,

127
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,340
I could still retain a fragment of my soul

128
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,980
to cultivate again
even with my body destroyed.

129
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,000
But now,

130
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,230
I'm just a powerless person.

131
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,590
This formation will reduce me into ashes.

132
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,680
I won't get reincarnation.

133
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,490
I will be totally wiped out

134
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,100
in the Three Realms.

135
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,440
Ling'er.

136
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,690
Ling'er!

137
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,670
Father,

138
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,830
you're partly responsible

139
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,550
for my death.

140
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,910
I was wrong.

141
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,970
I shouldn't have hurt you
in the name of protection.

142
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,060
I shouldn't have made decisions for you.

143
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,210
Come out.

144
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,780
Come out now, okay?

145
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,190
Zhang Suan.

146
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm here.

147
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,290
You should leave

148
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,860
before it's too late.

149
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,480
Zhang Suan?

150
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,490
Yes!

151
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,240
Save Ling'er!

152
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,780
Hurry!

153
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,220
Save Ling'er!

154
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,210
Please save her now!

155
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,830
I...

156
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,240
The Thread of Destiny.

157
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,830
The Thread of Destiny!

158
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,260
Only you can save Ling'er.

159
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,750
Yu Ya,

160
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,500
just tell me

161
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,980
about my daughter's deadly tribulation
you mentioned

162
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,960
last time.

163
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,270
No,

164
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,360
I can't reveal it.

165
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,200
Here.

166
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,130
Take it.

167
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
Marriage destiny.

168
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,480
Marriage destiny

169
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:35,760
is the solution.

170
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,380
My daughter's marriage destiny? With whom?

171
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,590
Boy,

172
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,340
I know your name is Zhang Suan.

173
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,960
Don't be afraid.

174
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,570
I brought you here

175
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,140
because you can save my daughter.

176
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,400
You have good talent as well.

177
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
You're cut out for cultivation.

178
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,430
What on earth are you up to?

179
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,850
I'd like to set you up with someone.

180
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,340
I have a daughter

181
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,550
aged 206,

182
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,590
as beautiful as flowers,

183
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,150
adept in magic,

184
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,850
top-notch at artifact forging,

185
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,370
gentle, kind,

186
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,570
gorgeous, and considerate.

187
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think she and you

188
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,970
can make a perfect match.

189
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,670
Is that so?

190
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,190
But my grandmother is only 60.

191
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,970
That sounds harsh, boy.

192
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,120
The mortal lifespan

193
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,480
and the immortal lifespan are different.

194
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,140
If mortals and immortals are different,

195
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,530
then why do you insist
on marrying your daughter off to me?

196
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,860
You... I... you...

197
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,370
It's hard to explain.

198
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,620
Come on.

199
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,890
Keep this jade pendant well.

200
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,390
This is your perfect marriage destiny.

201
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,580
I was too young then.

202
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,970
I can't remember.

203
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,200

-Please!
-Don't do this.

212

213
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,450
I don't know how to save her either!

215
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,910
He has no feelings for me.

216
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,360
Neither can he save me.

[Lord Qing Xu, Yuan Chenghua]

220
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,980
Yeah,

221
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,400
your name's carved on this stele,
receiving offerings from the Three Realms

222
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,200
and reverence for all eternity.

223
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,700
Of course you've been doing well.

224
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,510
But what about me?

225
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,900

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,130
They haven't made a decision yet.

229
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,610
Seems like I need to hold on a bit longer.

230
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,500
This is where the yin and yang
of all beings converge.

231
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,700
Only the balanced yin and yang energies

232
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,650
can keep the formation stable.

233
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,680
If one side becomes too strong,

234
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,790
the other will be completely consumed.

235
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,030
The formation will then break on its own.

236
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,440
So,

237
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,200
one of us must die.

238
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,480
That's right.

Time flows differently here
from the outside.

A moment passing here

241
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,480
might equal a day outside.

242
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,550
Ruyue,

243
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,070
Xiao Jingshan has now
reconstructed his body

244
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,390
and turned to the demonic path.

245
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,320
Those outside are no match for him.

Your hesitation

247

might put more people in danger.

248
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,050
If that's the case,

249
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,240
you should be the one
to survive and get out of here.

250
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,430
The Infinite Stele has the barrier
you set up on it.

251
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,660
Once you die,

252
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,210
Xiao Jingshan will wreck
the Infinite Stele.

253
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,180
Only you can fight him
if you make it out alive!

254
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,440
Don't be silly, Ruyue.

255

Still being severely injured,

256
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,050
I'm no match for him at all.

257

I'll channel
all my spiritual energy to you.

258

Ruyue!

259
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,280
It would only be a waste
of your spiritual energy.

260
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,680
Right now, only you stand a chance

261

to fight against him.

262

This is a deadly dilemma in and of itself.

00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,650
Luckily, Bai Jiusi is already dead.

342
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,740
Otherwise, I couldn't
stand a chance against you two.

343
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,920
Stop trying to provoke me.

344
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,510
Just me alone is more

345
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,210
than enough to take you down.

346
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,790
Nine Hells, Profound Mystery.

347
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,770
Six Lights, Demon Birth.

348
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,010
Eight Levels, Spirit Extinction.

349
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,070
Ten Directions, All Manifestation.

350
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,080
Purple Jade, Celestial Core.

351
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,410
Return to the Infinite.

352
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,350
Obliterate!

353
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,450
You're absorbing
the life force of all beings?

354
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,230
Forcibly enhancing your dark magic
will only annihilate your divine soul.

355
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,930
Are you really giving up on reincarnation?

356
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,660
As long as I can achieve my goal,

357
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,410
I'm willing to disappear forever
in this world.

358
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,890
Heaven is ruthless.

359
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,350
The god once killed humans.

360
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,480
Yet his name could be carved
on the Infinite Stele

361
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,010
to be worshipped by people.

362
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,400
Why do you want to stop me?

363
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,350
Yuan Chenghua did make mistakes,

364
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,000
but he died

365
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,440
in the god-demon war
to protect the peace of the Three Realms.

366
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,680
You're doing this

367
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,180
to satisfy yourself only.

368
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,120
Heaven may be ruthless,

369
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,140
but humans are different.

370
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,360
Love, family affection,

371
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,200
and fellowship all matter.

372
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,220
Everyone's life
should be theirs to decide,

373
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,900
not yours.

374
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
It's exactly these emotions you mentioned

375
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,110
that have held everyone down

376
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,300
and caused them bad endings.

377
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,270

If you guys joined forces,

422
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,010
I'd have a hard time
dealing with it, I'm afraid.

423
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,270
But people like you

424
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,350
always get caught up
in so-called righteousness and morality,

425
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,160
leading you astray step by step.

426
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,850
As I said before,

427
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,910
once you have a weakness,

428
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
you're bound to lose.

429
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,420
Xiao Jingshan,

430
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,460
haven't you realized that you're wrong?

431
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,510
On one hand,
you want to prove that heaven is ruthless,

432
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,410
yet on the other, you're furious
over the righteousness

433
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,670
and morality you said.

434
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,350
You're the one who's lying to yourself.

435
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,990
And also,

436
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,330
as I said before,

437
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,770
a weakness can also be armor.

438
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,730
Futile resistance.

439
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,690
Like an ant against a tree.

440
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,840
Qiyue, I need your help!

441
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:58,810
Come!

442
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,650
There's a trace of Bai Jiusi's soul
in this sword.

443
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,260
Even death can't stop him
from protecting you.

444
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,460
Bai Jiusi,

445
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,340
help me one last time!

446
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,970
Today,

447
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,690
you won't get away.

448
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,160
You've lost.

449
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Not necessarily.

450
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,370
It's useless.

451
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,620
If you weren't injured,

452
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,650
you might stand a chance to fix this.

453
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,150
But now, you can't stop it.

454
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,100
Having the Three Realms perish with me,

455
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,610
I'd say it's worth it.

456
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,000
Divine Lord,

457
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,930
don't give up.

458
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,410
Ling'er?

459
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,530
You...

460
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,150
You guys...

461
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,220
Stand up.

462
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,370
Follow me.

463
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,010
Let's go to the Ascension Terrace.

464
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,630
My master is still there.

465
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,450
Let's make one last attempt.

466
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,240
I've sensed an anomaly at Tianmu Peak.

467
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,190
Anyone who can go with me?

468
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,170
I'm willing to go with you!

469
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,630
I'll go with you!

470
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,000
Count me in as well.

471
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,340
That's Danxia Land where Li Mo once lived.

472
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,390
I want to protect it.

473
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,420
I'm sorry, Ling'er.

474
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,030
You don't need to feel guilty.

475
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,840
Actually,

476
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,490
I'm not that into you either.

477
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,760
What I really fall for

478
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,360
is your unwavering love

479
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
for the Divine Lord.

480
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,810
Because before that, I never knew that

481
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,260
some love

482
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,650
could make people willing
to risk their own lives.

483
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,160
I see!

484
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,340
I got it!

485
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,810
Ling'er is having nirvana.

486
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,470
She has passed her love tribulation.

487
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,890
I see now!

488
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,320
I'm okay.

489
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,300
Xiao Jingshan,

490
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,200
it's time for us to settle scores now!

491
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,260
Xiao Jingshan,

492
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,320
you could have wiped out

493
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,920
anyone in your way real fast,

494
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,960
yet you went out of your way

495
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:22,240
to set up troublesome
and time-consuming obstacles for everyone.

496
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,780
Just as I said earlier,

497
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,490
you've been lying to yourself all along.

498
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,850
The truth is,
this was never about testing others.

499
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,530
It was a test for yourself.

500
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,130
You wanted someone to prove

501
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,280
that you were wrong.

502
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,470
Are you

503
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,140
satisfied now?

504
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,760
Do you still remember

505
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,360
the last page
of the artifact record I gave you?

506
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,100
It's the Time-traveling Sundial.

507
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,410
Its forging has yet to be finished.

508
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,270
Because the final step
needs the creator to sacrifice

509
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,630
his life.

510
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,550
So what?

511
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,510
Siling,

512
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,340
I'm giving it to you.

513
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,430
Don't let me down.
