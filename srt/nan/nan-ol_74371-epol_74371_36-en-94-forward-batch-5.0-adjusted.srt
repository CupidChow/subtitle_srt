[Episode 36]

3
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,039
When you conspired with Jiang Heying

4
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,950
to fake an attack from foreign enemies
and murder my father,

5
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,210
did you ever think
you'd end up like this?

6
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,590
It wasn't me.

7
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,360
It was Jiang Heying.

8
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,940
He was the one

9
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,190
who planned everything.

10
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,940
He was the one

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
who harbored resentment
against you and your father.

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,570
He was the ruthless one.

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,810
I had nothing to do with it.

14
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,640
Still making excuses
when death is at your doorstep.

15
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,040
Do you really think you'll leave
the Imperial Clan Court alive?

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,690
Every one of your crimes

17
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,250
has irrefutable evidence,

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,660
all punishable by execution
according to law.

19
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,390
His Majesty only arranged this

20
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,070
to save the royal family some dignity.

21
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,980
You've always schemed in the shadows.

22
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,190
Before you die,

23
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,420
I'll give you a chance
to act like a decent man.

24
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,980
I was wrong.

25
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,020
I was wrong.

26
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,900
I kowtow

27
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:04,370
to your father

28
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,900
and admit my guilt.

29
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,110
Every wound you inflicted on my father,

30
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,190
I'll make you, a viper,

31
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,820
feel it yourself.

32
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,409
You call me a viper,

33
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,060
but in this palace,

34
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,260
who isn't driven by wild ambition?

35
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,580
I only did what I had to do.

36
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,270
I did nothing wrong.

37
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,260
I did nothing wrong!

38
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,900
The victor writes history. That's all.

39
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,020
Father taught me that.

40
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,460
You dare say he was wrong?

41
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,620
Do you dare?

42
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,330
Yan Chi, if you want revenge,

43
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,580
you should take Wan

44
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,460
to your father's grave

45
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,860
and end your lives there.

46
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,140
Because it was you two

47
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,420
who truly caused your father's death.

48
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,740
What are you talking about?

49
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,060
Yan Chi,

50
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,060
you humiliated me

51
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
for a woman.

52
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,260
You humiliated me.

53
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,330
How could I tolerate that?

54
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,770
That's why I resolved

55
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,990
to kill your father

56
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,940
and get back at you.

57
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,460
Yan Chi, you got your own father killed

58
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,860
because of a woman.

59
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,770
You're the unfilial son

60
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,650
who betrayed your father and ancestors.

61
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,920
You betrayed them!

62
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,460
Kill me.

63
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,770
Kill me.

64
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,200
Kill me!

65
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,610
Your Highness must not act out of anger

66
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,580
and disregard the law.

67
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,020
Our ancestor established
the Yan family law:

68
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,900
no matter the crime,

69
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,590
no descendant of the Yan family

70
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,770
shall suffer corporal punishment.

71
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,380
Even in treason,

72
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,630
they're to be granted
a death sentence in prison,

73
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,260
not executed in public.

74
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,770
Whoever breaks

75
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,090
this law…

76
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,560
shall be punished by Heaven.

77
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,620
Today,

78
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,570
I die by your sword.

79
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
I wonder…

80
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,140
how you'll explain this to Father.

81
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,650
Outrageous!

82
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,170
As a secretary in the Ministry of Justice,

83
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,450
you brutally killed a prince.

84
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,450
If this gets out,

85
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,220
how am I…

86
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,490
how am I supposed to handle this?

87
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,330
I

88
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,220
can turn myself in
to the Court of Judicial Review.

89
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,620
I'll confess everything

90
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,930
and accept my punishment.

91
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,260
You'll confess?

92
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,790
That's easy enough for you,

93
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,820
but what position does that put me

94
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,540
and the royal family in?

95
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,050
The commoner Yan Qi

96
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,050
conspired with Jiang Heying

97
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,570
to assassinate his uncle,
the late Prince Rui.

98
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,030
He committed the most heinous crimes

99
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,380
and abandoned all human decency.

100
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,710
He deserved execution.

101
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,100
It was precisely because I considered

102
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,500
the royal family's dignity

103
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,630
that I didn't make this matter public.

104
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,810
You fool.

105
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,290
You've already known

106
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,900
who murdered your father,

107
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,980
and you've seen

108
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,480
how Yuan Qing handled things just now.

109
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,140
So you should understand

110
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,260
how I intend to deal with this.

111
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,020
Why entangle yourself with Yan Qi further

112
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,740
and give others something to talk about?

113
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,290
I

114
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,540
had to make Yan Qi confess

115
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,020
and punish him myself

116
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,980
so my father could rest in peace.

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,630
Otherwise,

118
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,670
I'd be unworthy as a son.

119
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:53,980
Forget it.

120
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,450
Yuan Qing,

121
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,840
those attendants you took with you,

122
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
did they see

123
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,220
how Yan Qi died?

124
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,570
Your Majesty,

125
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,650
my boys

126
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,860
are quite dim-witted

127
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,050
and didn't

128
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,180
see anything at all.

129
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,680
What about you?

130
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,600
You didn't see

131
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,290
anything either?

132
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,010
My eyesight is poor.

133
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,720
I only vaguely saw the commoner Yan Qi

134
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,260
acting like a madman,

135
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,880
grabbing Prince Rui's sword

136
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,770
and stabbing himself in the chest.

137
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,710
Yan Qi

138
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
had always been unruly and defiant.

139
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,730
In the end,

140
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,280
his madness took over,

141
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,930
leading him to take his own life.

142
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,820
But you

143
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,440
failed to stop him in time,

144
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,830
which was negligence on your part.

145
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,860
From today onward,

146
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,860
you're removed from your post
in the Ministry of Justice

147
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,100
and demoted to a commandant
in the Imperial Security Bureau,

148
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
assigned to guard

149
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,680
the inner palace gates.

150
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,320
Your Highness,
hurry and thank His Majesty.

151
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,810
What?

152
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,900
Do you take issue

153
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,770
with my decision?

154
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,070
I wouldn't dare.

155
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,300
Your Majesty,

156
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,930
thank you for your mercy.

157
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,810
Enough.

158
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,020
Spend the next few days

159
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,880
reflecting behind closed doors.

160
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,460
Don't stir up more trouble.

161
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,090
You may go now.

162
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,620
Yes.

163
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,170
Che,

164
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,700
did you hear that?

165
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,210
Yan Qi is dead.

166
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,380
That bastard is finally dead.

167
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,480
My dear Che,

168
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,930
just wait a little longer.

169
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,770
Mother will make sure

170
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,240
his entire household goes down with him.

171
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,580
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

172
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,450
Hurry!

173
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,420
Stand down.

174
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,370
Put away your swords.

175
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,550
Don't you trust the Young Marshal?

176
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,410
I was being reckless.

177
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,590
Please forgive me.

178
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,820
It's alright, Young Marshal.

179
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
I no longer serve in the Shuoxi Army,

180
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,500
so don't ever call me

181
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,700
Young Marshal again.

182
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,680
From now on,

183
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,860
just call me Commandant Yan.

184
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,960
We've admired you for a long time.

185
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,140
It's a pity that we never got a chance

186
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,170
to fight by your side

187
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,170
in battle.

188
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,850
No matter where you serve in the future,

189
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,900
in our hearts,

190
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
you'll always be the Young Marshal.

191
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,420
Xue Qingshan,

192
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,860
for what you just said,

193
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,260
I'll see you as a brother!

194
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,980
Bai Feng.

195
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,840
We're both colleagues and brothers-in-law.

196
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,900
Though we never
fought battles together before,

197
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,560
from now on,

198
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,900
we shall protect the capital together.

199
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,760
Young Marshal,

200
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,340
I'm at your service.

201
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,580
For the next few days,

202
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,770
you'll need to guard the city without me.

203
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,630
After I finish self-reflection,

204
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,810
I'll join you all

205
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,800
in defending the capital!

206
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,260
Yes!

207
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,810
Yan Qi is dead.

208
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,270
He threw himself onto my sword
and took his own life.

209
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,140
I didn't get to avenge my father
with my own hands.

210
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,610
Do you think he'd blame me?

211
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,050
He wouldn't.

212
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,220
Father certainly wouldn't want to see

213
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,070
the son he was most proud of

214
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,570
become a murderer.

215
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,430
Seeing you not consumed by hatred,

216
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,690
Father can rest in peace.

217
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,760
Are you hurt?

218
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,980
No.

219
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,100
It's all Qi's blood.

220
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,520
Did His Majesty blame you?

221
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,750
Not only did he not blame me,

222
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,180
but he didn't doubt for a second
that Yan Qi killed himself

223
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,180
and even covered it up for me.

224
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,940
He just said I was negligent

225
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,820
and demoted me to a commandant
in the Imperial Security Bureau.

226
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,050
I'm glad you're alright.

227
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,410
Father died so brutally,

228
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,000
and yet I couldn't let the world know
he was wronged.

229
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,430
I can't make peace with it.

230
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,010
I know.

231
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,900
But I must do this.

232
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,980
I must make the person on the throne

233
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,829
believe in me,

234
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,630
believe I acted impulsively,

235
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,250
and believe I never doubted him.

236
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,380
Only when he stops guarding against me

237
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,619
will we have a chance

238
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,130
to uncover the truth.

239
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,490
Up in heaven, Father will surely

240
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,150
understand your intentions.

241
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,040
If Father were still alive

242
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,740
and knew the suspect we're investigating

243
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,520
was the very emperor he swore loyalty to,

244
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,360
he'd probably be furious.

245
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,200
Your father,

246
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,380
my father,

247
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,520
and Prince Jin—

248
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,340
none of them were blindly loyal.

249
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,510
They weren't loyal to Yan Huai,

250
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,580
but to a wise ruler who could bring

251
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,410
lasting peace to Zhou's people.

252
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,550
As long as we tread carefully

253
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,300
and don't stir up political unrest,

254
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,820
they'll all support us.

255
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,490
Come.

256
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,210
I just

257
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,820
compared these writings.

258
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,540
The annotations on the go manual,

259
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,800
Sui's letters,

260
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,210
and the notes on the scroll
from the Xuanji Pavilion—

261
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,170
they were all written by the same person.

262
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,970
So Consort Jin wasn't mistaken.

263
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,100
These are indeed

264
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,160
His Majesty's writings
from before he took the throne.

265
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,860
"Che

266
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,260
spat on the zither to clean it.

267
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,510
What a naughty boy.

268
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,160
He's truly my son."

269
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,970
This is His Majesty's record

270
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,780
of Yan Che's childhood antics.

271
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,520
Back then,
we only focused on the handwriting.

272
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,050
But reading it closely now,

273
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,500
you can find
that His Majesty and Her Majesty

274
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,700
were so close before he took the throne.

275
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,520
Yan Che was also
deeply loved by His Majesty.

276
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:50,520
No.

277
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,140
For as long as I can remember,

278
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,710
His Majesty never once
spent the night at the Fengyi Palace.

279
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,820
He only treats the Empress with courtesy.

280
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
As for Yan Che,

281
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,650
he always called him an unworthy son.

282
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,580
When did he ever show him affection?

283
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,340
Calligraphy reflects the heart.

284
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,930
What's in the mind
shows through the brush.

285
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,790
If His Majesty's personality
changed drastically

286
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,620
after being injured in battle,
it could explain

287
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,990
the change in his handwriting.

288
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,140
But Sui said

289
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,210
Consort Jin refused
to accept that explanation,

290
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,730
suggesting the changes in handwriting

291
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,730
weren't due to personality changes.

292
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,650
If we could find

293
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,250
His Majesty's writing
from after the battle for comparison,

294
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,900
perhaps

295
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,250
we could discover the true reason
why His Majesty killed Consort Jin.

296
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,250
There's a memorial of mine

297
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,900
with a handwritten comment
from His Majesty.

298
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,620
You only returned to the capital
after Consort Jin died.

299
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,580
If that person wanted to cover this up,

300
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,010
he might not have written that comment

301
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,750
on the memorial himself.

302
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,820
Then we need to find his writing

303
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,210
from after the battle

304
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,480
but before Consort Jin's death.

305
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:42,930
Got it.

306
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,750
This is a private letter

307
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,110
from His Majesty to my father.

308
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,110
Father kept it safe all these years.

309
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,830
This handwriting

310
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,900
somehow looks familiar.

311
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,690
It's nothing like

312
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,140
His Majesty's handwriting

313
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,170
from before he took the throne,

314
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,100
but it's identical

315
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
to the carving on the wooden hairpin

316
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,350
Princess Yi gave me.

317
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,620
Are you saying

318
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,100
that the current emperor is
actually Prince Yi, Yan Han?

319
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,640
How is that possible?

320
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,900
I once

321
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,610
heard of the face-changing technique,

322
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,430
but I've never seen it myself.

323
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,090
I don't know if it's even real.

324
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,910
Even if it were,

325
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,100
there's no way Grandmother

326
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,770
couldn't recognize her own son.

327
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,580
And Noble Consort Su and the Empress—

328
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,340
they've been with His Majesty
since before he ascended the throne.

329
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,780
They couldn't possibly have been fooled.

330
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,250
The more you think about it,

331
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,450
the stranger it gets.

332
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,620
But this concerns the throne itself,

333
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,550
so we can't ask around recklessly.

334
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,350
This matter

335
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,490
concerns the stability of the court.

336
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,220
Before a new heir is appointed,

337
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,070
we can't let a single word leak.

338
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,820
We cannot let

339
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,320
our fathers'

340
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,750
and Prince Jin's sacrifices go to waste.

341
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Let's keep

342
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,830
investigating Prince Jin's case.

343
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,830
With the clues we already have,

344
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,460
we can definitely vindicate my father

345
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,330
and Prince Jin.

346
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,860
You bitch!

347
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,300
Prince Cheng just died,

348
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,860
and you're already fleeing
with stolen money.

349
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,590
You truly are a venomous woman!

350
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,700
Just because he preferred you,

351
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,890
you humiliated me

352
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,430
and trampled all over me.

353
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,510
I'll make you join him in death today!

354
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,060
How dare you!

355
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,340
My uncle is the Marquis of Zhongyong.

356
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,010
My cousin is Princess Rui.

357
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,140
If you kill me,

358
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,900
they won't let you get away with it!

359
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,620
Is that so?

360
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,620
Then let's give it a try

361
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,340
and see if anyone will avenge you

362
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,450
after I kill you.

363
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,620
Go to hell!

364
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,490
Stop!

365
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,380
The traitor's accomplices and relatives

366
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,640
shall all be executed!

367
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,450
I'm the daughter of the Feng family.

368
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,730
Prince Cheng and I

369
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,550
have already divorced.

370
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,580
Wan.

371
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,900
Xiang is dead.

372
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,010
Qin Xiang is dead.

373
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,620
Chi asked me

374
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
to get Xiang out as soon as possible,

375
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,650
but before I could, His Majesty
summoned me for court business,

376
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,910
so I got there too late.

377
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,460
Why are you saying all this?

378
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,680
Little Wan'er,

379
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,310
he could never have made it.

380
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,900
All of Prince Cheng's wives and concubines

381
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,970
were executed on the spot

382
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,970
when the household was raided.

383
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,650
Don't cry.

384
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,450
The Empress hates Prince Cheng the most.

385
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,650
Some Imperial Guards

386
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,550
were definitely sent by Lord Zhao
to take revenge during the raid.

387
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,140
Prince Cheng deserved it,

388
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,780
but what did those concubines do wrong?

389
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,310
What did Qin Xiang do wrong?

390
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,050
I'll go to Chi.

391
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,250
He's still confined for reflection

392
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,540
and probably doesn't know yet.

393
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,070
Let's go.

394
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,380
After Uncle received the news,

395
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,650
he sent people to Prince Cheng's Mansion
to collect Xiang's body.

396
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,440
Wan,

397
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,060
do you think I stole

398
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,620
Xiang's good fortune?

399
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,720
If she had married Xue Qingshan back then,

400
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,450
she wouldn't…

401
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,970
Shuang, don't say that.

402
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,580
Come.

403
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,520
We all chose our own paths.

404
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,320
There's no right or wrong.

405
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,540
Wan,

406
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,170
I want to bring Mother to the capital.

407
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,970
Now that Xiang's gone,

408
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,450
she only has me to rely on.

409
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,540
It's a good idea.

410
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
I can also fulfill my filial duties.

411
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,580
Shuang, you're pregnant now.

412
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,250
Remember,

413
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,820
you mustn't cry so hard anymore.

414
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,060
Really?

415
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:19,970
Yes.

416
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,380
You mustn't let yourself get upset
in the coming days.

417
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,000
Noble Consort?

418
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,450
Noble Consort Su?

419
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,160
Noble Consort.

420
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,730
This is the tonic specially sent
by His Majesty.

421
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,620
It's good for your health.

422
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,680
Noble Consort?

423
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,340
Noble Consort Su.

424
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,550
What do you want?

425
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,860
Get out!

426
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,780
Get out of here!

427
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,580
Don't ever come back!

428
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,170
He's trying to kill me.

429
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,700
He killed the Crown Prince.

430
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,710
He killed Qi.

431
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,900
My Qi.

432
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,170
My Qi!

433
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,450
So this is where you and your father
used to hide things.

434
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,050
It really is well concealed.

435
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,900
If I hadn't looked carefully,

436
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,760
I wouldn't have noticed it at all.

437
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,210
What is that?

438
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,350
It's my father's handwriting.

439
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,860
"Jin" means Consort Jin.

440
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,380
Only His Majesty can use
the five-clawed golden dragon pattern.

441
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,970
This dagger is enough to prove

442
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,030
that His Majesty killed Consort Jin.

443
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,250
My father really risked his life
to hide the key evidence.

444
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,040
I have to go to Li Muyun.

445
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,930
Once my confinement is lifted…

446
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,190
I can't wait that long.

447
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,560
I want to hear what he has to say

448
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,150
about my father hiding the murder weapon.

449
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,510
Your Highness,

450
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,350
why did you ask to meet me here?

451
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,210
The innocent don't act in the shadows.

452
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,140
I want to reopen Prince Jin's case.

453
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,250
Your Highness, you should know

454
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,650
that according to Zhou's law,

455
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,490
without new evidence sufficient
to overturn the previous verdict,

456
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,530
a closed case

457
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,030
cannot be reopened.

458
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,170
I know,

459
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,690
but I'm more interested in your reason

460
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,350
for accusing Prince Jin and Lord Shen

461
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,350
of conspiring to cover up the crime.

462
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,340
Shen Yi hid the real murder weapon

463
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,640
to make Prince Jin

464
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,890
look innocent.

465
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,790
Since you never found the weapon,

466
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,950
what made you so sure

467
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,520
Prince Jin was the killer?

468
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,860
Prince Jin was caught at the scene.

469
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,080
If not him,

470
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,580
then who?
Prince Sui, who was just a little boy?

471
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,490
So you used a dagger

472
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,140
with a blunt edge as the murder weapon

473
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,300
to close the case?

474
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,260
So that day,

475
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,650
you did read Prince Jin's case file.

476
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,640
That dagger

477
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,320
was a gift from Prince Jin to Prince Sui.

478
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,100
Prince Jin never confessed,

479
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,930
and you never found any evidence.

480
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,340
But to earn a promotion,

481
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,590
you falsely accused Lord Shen
of hiding the murder weapon

482
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,540
and used a dagger that couldn't even kill

483
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,740
to convict Prince Jin.

484
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,540
I never falsely accused Shen Yi.

485
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,110
He really did help the real murderer

486
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,620
hide the weapon.

487
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,550
He was the one

488
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,380
who had no respect for the law.

489
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,450
He was a sycophant.

490
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,010
So,

491
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,010
you know who really killed Consort Jin.

492
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,110
Why would you say that, Your Highness?

493
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,450
You'd only call Lord Shen a sycophant

494
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,120
if you knew

495
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,050
who he was protecting.

496
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,660
I heard Lord Shen always
thought highly of you,

497
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,510
so I assume

498
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,530
he must have told you

499
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,350
about the murder weapon he hid.

500
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,620
You're so sharp, Your Highness.

501
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,490
Since you know the truth,

502
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,990
you should also know

503
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,310
that I made no false accusations.

504
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,100
Do you really not know

505
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,250
why Lord Shen hid the murder weapon?

506
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,010
You stepped over the bones
of Prince Jin and Lord Shen

507
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,970
to reach your third-rank position,

508
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,580
and now you just turn around

509
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,140
and call Lord Shen a sycophant.

510
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,570
Do you truly feel no shame?

511
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,030
I have a clear conscience!

512
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,780
Shen Yi claimed he did it
for the stability of the court,

513
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,300
but that was just an excuse

514
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,360
for his cowardice!

515
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,580
If I had known
where the real murder weapon was hidden,

516
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,410
I would've made it public long ago.

517
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,820
The law makes no exception

518
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,880
for royals. That's the Heavenly Way!

519
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,170
Shen Yi and Prince Jin

520
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,410
deserved to be my stepping stones!

521
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,700
If Heaven truly sees all,

522
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,140
someone like you
who betrayed your own mentor

523
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,600
will not come to a good end.

524
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,530
The Heavenly Way favors no one—

525
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,840
only those who are truly sincere.

526
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,690
I just hit Li Muyun.

527
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,140
Did he hurt you?

528
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,130
No.

529
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,170
So he knew all along

530
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,270
that the real killer of Consort Jin
was His Majesty.

531
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,620
My father told him

532
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,900
when he hid that dagger.

533
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,630
He didn't show an ounce of guilt

534
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,850
and actually believes
he was following the Heavenly Way.

535
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,170
The way he looked when he said that

536
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,300
reminded me exactly of Ning Buyi.

537
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,170
You suspect

538
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,080
Li Muyun is a member
of the Heavenly Way Society?

539
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,170
I wouldn't say they're totally unrelated.

540
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,100
But he's already a third-rank official.

541
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,490
His obsession with the Heavenly Way

542
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,930
doesn't make any sense.

543
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,950
If Li Muyun really is a member
of the Heavenly Way Society,

544
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,420
its influence and ambition

545
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,750
are truly frightening.

546
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,580
Leave this to me.

547
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,430
You must not see him again.

548
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,980
I really wish I could strip him
of his official position myself.

549
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,790
Don't worry.

550
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,930
Whether he is or not,

551
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,060
I won’t let him off easy.

552
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,620
-Prefect Zheng, forgive me.
-General Bai.

553
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,780
Master, Your Highness,

554
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,840
I'll take my leave.

555
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,150
Prince Rui?

556
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,450
Princess Yongci?

557
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,210
Prefect Zheng, I've heard

558
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,780
you're a renowned gourmet.

559
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,140
So I've invited you to my place

560
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,280
to taste some Shuoxi cuisine.

561
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,680
I hope you'll like it.

562
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,520
Your Highness,
you didn't go to such trouble

563
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,760
to get me here

564
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,250
just to treat me to breakfast, did you?

565
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,860
Please don't take offense, Prefect Zheng.

566
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,650
His Lordship is currently
confined for reflection.

567
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,780
He got you here that way

568
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,100
simply to avoid any whispers

569
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,730
about you having private dealings
with Prince Rui.

570
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,590
Prefect Zheng.

571
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,410
Take a seat.

572
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,050
Go on then.

573
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,270
What can I do for you?

574
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,890
I heard that back in the day,

575
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,490
you and Li Muyun took the imperial exam
in the same year.

576
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,890
You ranked second-tier,

577
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,260
while Li Muyun only ranked third-tier.

578
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,500
In terms of learning,

579
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,210
Li Muyun and I were evenly matched.

580
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,490
He was proud and aloof.

581
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,210
At the palace exam, he spoke too boldly.

582
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,690
His Majesty found him too defiant

583
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,690
to serve in court

584
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,380
and downgraded his paper
to the lowest rank.

585
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,780
He came from a poor family

586
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,580
and only managed to become the governor
of a remote county.

587
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,690
He spent a few hard years

588
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,220
in that godforsaken place.

589
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

590
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,710
Despite his rank in the imperial exam,

591
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,760
Li Muyun got promoted so quickly.

592
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,720
He must

593
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,820
understand the ways of officialdom
better than you do.

594
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,220
Speaking of promotions,

595
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,380
Li Muyun got promoted on his own merit.

596
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,930
He was quite accomplished
in criminal investigations,

597
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,410
helping his superiors
solve several major cases.

598
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,100
With Lord Shen's support,

599
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,960
he finally got his chance to rise.

600
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,380
Why are you asking about Li Muyun?

601
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,570
I'd like to ask you
to visit the Ministry of Justice

602
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,699
and check the places

603
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,219
where Li Muyun once served—

604
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,219
see if there were any murder cases
similar to the Heavenly Way Society's.

605
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,370
You suspect

606
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,780
Li Muyun is secretly working
with the Heavenly Way Society?

607
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,820
Perhaps

608
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,420
Li Muyun is actually a member
of the Heavenly Way Society.

609
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,630
After seeing the files,

610
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,449
I'll explain everything to you.

611
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,850
But I can't tell you about it now.

612
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,739
If I hadn't been demoted
to the Imperial Security Bureau

613
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,530
and lost access to the archives,

614
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,389
I wouldn't trouble you with this.

615
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,860
It's not ideal,
but I have no other choice.

616
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,179
I hope you'll lend me a hand.

617
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:02,100
I'll do it.

618
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,420
Your Majesty,

619
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,710
the scarcity of heirs is not a good omen.

620
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,490
Please take more consorts
to continue the royal lineage.

621
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,380
Only when a proper
crown prince is selected

622
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,900
can the nation stay stable

623
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,620
and the dynasty endure.

624
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,490
Your Majesty,

625
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,430
you're still in your prime.

626
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,830
There's no urgent need to name an heir.

627
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,610
Why not observe a bit longer

628
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,840
before selecting the crown prince?

629
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,700
Your Majesty,

630
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,160
since Prince Rui's passing,

631
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,490
the princes have died one after another.

632
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,520
Please consult the Imperial
Astronomical Bureau for guidance

633
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,410
and issue a Self-reproach Edict

634
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,900
to calm the spirits above.

635
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,050
How dare you!

636
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,740
My sons...

637
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,530
My sons

638
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,700
died before their time, one after another.

639
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,610
And you,

640
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,410
instead of easing my grief,

641
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,890
want me

642
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,510
to issue a Self-reproach Edict?

643
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,740
What are you after?

644
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,570
What

645
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,380
have I done wrong?

646
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,740
Tell me,

647
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,090
what have I done wrong?

648
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,970
Even if

649
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,180
every last one of my sons dies,

650
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,130
I still have brothers

651
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,780
and nephews.

652
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,140
Yan Li, Yan Chi, and Yan Ze

653
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,230
are all upright, loyal men.

654
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,700
Today,

655
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,700
I'll make it known

656
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,320
to all civil and military officials:

657
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,740
Even if one day

658
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,390
I pass from this world,

659
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,180
there will still be a worthy ruler
to take my place.

660
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,650
I don't need
a bunch of useless fools like you

661
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,110
to tell me
to issue a Self-reproach Edict.

662
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,340
Come here.

663
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,990
What are you doing here?

664
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,310
The palace isn't peaceful right now.

665
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,220
If you've got nothing important,
stay away.

666
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,300
Word about what happened in the palace
has already spread.

667
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,230
His Majesty said

668
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,660
all royal kinsmen

669
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,220
are eligible to be named heir.

670
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,050
Is that true?

671
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,900
Yes.

672
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,070
It's like a bolt from the blue.

673
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,500
It's a chance to be named heir

674
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
and even ascend the throne someday.

675
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,260
It's incredible news,

676
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,310
and you're not thrilled about it?

677
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,800
What's incredible
about sitting on the throne?

678
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,180
His Majesty stays up late and rises early,

679
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
goes to court
to listen to bickering ministers,

680
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,660
and then reviews memorials after that.

681
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,320
He can't even eat
without attendants watching,

682
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,250
and forget about drinking wine.

683
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,660
Living like that

684
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,060
sounds worse than death.

685
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,530
His Majesty is diligent and disciplined
because he's a good ruler.

686
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,990
You could just be a bad one.

687
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,050
I doubt I'd live to be a bad ruler.

688
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,740
Prince Cheng
and the Crown Prince are both dead.

689
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,530
With my abilities,

690
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,380
how long do you think I'd last in court?

691
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,910
Besides,

692
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,860
I'm only His Majesty's godson.

693
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,880
I don't have a single drop of royal blood.

694
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,860
As long as there are still royals alive,

695
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,390
I'm not even in the running.

696
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,630
That's true.

697
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,760
Looks like you'll just have to be

698
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,290
a prince who holds my horse.

699
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,940
I'd rather be your stable boy

700
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,640
than be a prince.

701
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,200
Whoever wants that title can take it.

702
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,210
What should I do then?

703
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,380
Ze's eyes are almost healed,

704
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,090
and I'm planning to return to Jingzhou.

705
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,610
Maybe I'll just sneak you
into the carriage

706
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,070
and take you with me
when I leave the capital.

707
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,830
His eyes are almost healed?

708
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,260
Of course.

709
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,740
Why else would I be waiting for you?

710
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,700
I just want to ask

711
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,030
if our previous agreement is still valid.

712
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,950
Of course it is.

713
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,300
Ning, I always keep my word.

714
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,490
Wait for me.

715
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,070
[Fengyi Palace]

716
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,510
Letting nephews inherit the throne?

717
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,450
That's absolutely ridiculous.

718
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,610
Your Majesty,

719
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,300
please lower your voice.

720
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,780
Someone might hear you.

721
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,180
So what if they heard?

722
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,760
I'm just a deposed empress.

723
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,570
What do I have to be afraid of?

724
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,780
Give this

725
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,260
to Princess Yongci.

726
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,350
Yes.

727
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,820
That's his throne.

728
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,230
I'll die before I let you have your way.

729
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,490
Sorry for making you wait,
Your Highness.

730
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,010
The Empress Dowager is still asleep.

731
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,940
I didn't have the heart to wake her.

732
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,900
How is Grandmother's health?

733
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
She's doing well.

734
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,970
You needn't worry, Your Highness.

735
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,970
What about Sui?

736
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,880
Maybe I can take him out for a bit?

737
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,180
The Empress Dowager has been
keeping him busy with lessons lately.

738
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:49,980
I'm afraid...

739
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,130
Then I won't bother him.

740
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,530
I'll come back in a few days
to pay my respects to Grandmother.

741
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,990
Your Highness.

742
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,320
Unless the Empress Dowager summons you,

743
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,190
it's best

744
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,390
not to visit the palace for now.

745
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Understood. Thank you, Ma'am Chen.

746
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,490
Give me the medicine box.

747
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:22,970
Yes.

748
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,730
Thank you.

749
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,920
Your Highness.

750
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,550
You dropped something.

751
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,490
The Empress.

752
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,260
Shuhua.

753
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,260
It really is the Empress.

754
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,260
Bai Feng, go get some lye water.

755
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:29,900
Yes.

756
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,190
I never thought

757
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,140
the Empress would know how to carve
a Nine-Fold Script stamp.

758
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,610
Judging by the depth of the carving,

759
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,660
it looks like it was done with a hairpin.

760
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,250
With this kind of cleverness,

761
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,830
it's no wonder
she and His Majesty were so close

762
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,310
before he took the throne.

763
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,500
The Empress now

764
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,870
isn't the same woman who used to get mad

765
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,450
when her son wiped spit on a zither.

766
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,220
Her allies in the palace
haven't shown themselves yet.

767
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,620
Her sending you a message

768
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,930
may not be a good thing.

769
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,240
Master, the lye water's here.

770
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
South of the city.

771
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,800
Anmin.

772
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,100
Zhang.

773
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,740
Qian.

774
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,870
What does this mean?

775
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:11,970
Bai Feng, go check

776
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,140
if there's a street or alley named Zhang

777
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,400
in the Anmin District, south of the city.

778
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,190
Master,

779
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,960
there is a Zhang Alley.

780
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,660
Zhang Alley…

781
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,530
Then "Qian"

782
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,260
might refer to someone
with the surname Qian.

783
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,780
Master,

784
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,140
I'll go check it out.

785
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,980
Could this be a trap for you?

786
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,950
Not entirely impossible.

787
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,010
But given the Empress's current situation,

788
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,480
she needs us

789
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,650
to avenge Che.

790
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,600
There's only one Qian family

791
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,060
in the entire Zhang Alley.

792
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,490
Is this Madam Qian's home?

793
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,740
I'm Qian.

794
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,410
Are you the ones the Empress sent?

795
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:28,970
We are.

796
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,340
Madam Qian,

797
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,680
are you a former palace servant?

798
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,850
I was once the head matron
serving the Empress Dowager.

799
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,810
If you once served the Empress Dowager,

800
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,460
why did you leave the palace
to seek refuge with the Empress?

801
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,180
I've never betrayed the Empress Dowager,

802
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,660
but to survive,

803
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,660
I have no choice but to live
under the Empress's protection.

804
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,590
What do you mean?

805
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,720
If the Empress has sent you to me,

806
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,080
she must be prepared to risk everything.

807
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,470
I'm not a coward who fears death.

808
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,380
But if I were to die now,

809
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,410
the secret I carry would die with me.

810
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,420
And if this secret never comes to light,

811
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,130
it'll eventually
throw the court into chaos.

812
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,130
If that happened,

813
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,240
how could I ever face the Empress Dowager?

814
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:22,860
Come.

815
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,260
Get up and tell us.

816
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,050
What kind of secret
could threaten the court

817
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,820
and involve the Empress Dowager?

818
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,610
Because

819
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,810
when the Empress Dowager first gave birth,

820
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,850
she bore twins.
