00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,930
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,680
Attack!

4
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,789
Attack!

5
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,530
It's me,

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,680
Yan Ze,

7
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,510
an orphan whose parents
both died because of you.

8
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,720
How did you know?

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,320
It must be you wretched lackey.

10
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,670
I...

11
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,340
I trusted and valued you so deeply,

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,680
yet you dared to collude with traitors

13
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,829
and betray me!

14
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,040
As they say,

15
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,670
evil deeds will eventually
lead to self-destruction.

16
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,390
Yuan Qing,

17
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,850
serve tea to the sinner.

18
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,110
Yuan Qing...

19
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,450
Your Majesty, don't worry.

20
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,610
I've added the same amount of
Dream Butterfly Poison to this tea

21
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,329
as was given to the late Princess Xin.

22
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,480
Your Majesty will have plenty of time
to savor

23
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,600
and watch,

24
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,790
to see clearly
how the late Princess Xin died!

25
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,600
The Dream Butterfly Poison you found
back then was made from the wing powder

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,880
of the Five-colored Butterfly
from the Southern Frontier.

27
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,280
This poison is colorless and odorless,

28
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,110
only detectable after it takes effect.

29
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,280
My poor mother.

30
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,790
She saved your life,

31
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,990
yet became the first person you used
to test poison.

32
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,720
Poor me. I tested the water temperature
for my dying mother,

33
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,180
yet got my eyesight ruined
with just one sip!

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,130
My Father followed my mother in death,

35
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,040
surely also your doing.

36
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,510
This is

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,829
as heartless as it gets.

38
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,230
Don't you

39
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,440
celebrate too soon.

40
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,870
I

41
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,390
still have two palace guard divisions
standing by on full alert,

42
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,760
as well as the Huaiyang Army,

43
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,410
which will soon

44
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,040
enter the capital to protect me.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,079
Has Your Majesty forgotten?

46
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,070
The one who delivered your verbal orders
to the Palace Guard Division

47
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,280
was me.

48
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,920
You won't be seeing the Huaiyang Army.

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,550
You...

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,280
You...

51
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,200
You...

52
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,230
You bastard!

53
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,600
I'll kill you!

54
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,550
Traitor Yan Han,

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,140
such an end for you is only proper,

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,279
showing that justice prevails!

57
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,839
Yuan Qing!

58
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,650
Read the Self-reproach Edict.

59
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,670
Yan?

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,440
-Li.
-What are you doing?

61
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,120
Why are you here?

62
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,440
You've come at the perfect time.

63
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,500
A son pays for his father's debtsâ€”

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,840
that is the eternal way of heaven.

65
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,550
You...

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,600
Li.

67
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,159
Li, leave now!

68
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:00,920
They...

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,640
They're all rebels!

70
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,840
Hurry, Li.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,190
Li!

72
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,040
Li!

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,150
Yan Ze!

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Yan Ze,

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,250
what are you doing?

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,990
Li! Li!

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,830
Yan Ze, you've gone crazy!

78
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,960
What exactly are you trying to do?

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,640
Yan Li.

80
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,350
Listen carefully to
that Self-reproach Edict

81
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,440
and see the true colors of
this emperor before you.

82
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,520
Yuan Qing!

83
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,430
Yuan Qing!

84
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,160
By Heaven's mandate, I issue
this edict of self-reproach to the world.

85
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,640
I,

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,920
Yan Han, the second legitimate son
of the late Emperor,

87
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,480
incited Fu Chengye to rebel,

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,750
attempting to seize the throne,

89
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,840
-pretended to surrender
-Yuan Qing!

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,080
to lure my twin brother
Yan Huai to Storm Ridge

91
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,430
for a private meeting,

92
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,159
where I murdered him

93
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,870
and destroyed all evidence, after which

94
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,990
-I took the throne in my brother's name.
-What wrong did I do? I'm innocent!

95
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,159
-From then on, the order was overturned,
-I'm the chosen one!

96
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,020
the sun and moon darkened,
and all conscience lost.

97
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,400
End of the decree.

98
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,340
How dare you, a usurper of the throne,

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,990
claim you're the chosen one?

100
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,690
These are all just ravings

101
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,150
and nonsense.

102
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,890
Whether it's nonsense or not,

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,040
he himself knows best.

104
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,980
Isn't that right,

105
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,920
Prince Yi?

106
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,190
You...

107
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,600
You...

108
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,020
Prince Yi?

109
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,290
You heard it right.

110
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,460
He is your biological father,

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,350
Prince Yi, Yan Han.

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,340
My dear son, Li.

113
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,750
My dear son, Li!

114
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,760
Li.

115
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,280
Father...

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,110
Li.

117
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,200
Li.

118
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,040
Impossible.

119
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,210
This is impossible.

120
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,610
Otherwise, why do you think he allowed

121
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,170
Prince Cheng and the Crown Prince
to turn against each other,

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,010
yet treated you better than his own sons?

123
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,400
So what if I am Yan Han?

124
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,290
I

125
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,080
am also the Empress Dowager's
biological son,

126
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,960
still of the royal bloodline.

127
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,310
Just because

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,110
I was a twin,

129
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,600
the Yan family

130
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,600
cast me aside like worn-out shoes!

131
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Who has ever sought justice for me?

132
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,320
Heaven's justice is clear.

133
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,600
What the Yan family

134
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,750
owed me

135
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,210
should naturally be repaid
with the throne!

136
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,480
I have no shame before Heaven and Earth,

137
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,890
nor before my parents!

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,930
What about me and my mother?

139
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,409
Do you also feel no guilt toward us?

140
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,480
Li.

141
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,450
Why don't you ask your biological father

142
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,140
how Chi's mother died,

143
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,910
how Consort Jin

144
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,520
met her end,

145
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,720
and what caused

146
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Prince Jin and Shen Yi's deaths?

147
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,789
No way...

148
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,240
Li.

149
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,840
Everything I've done

150
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,710
is for you.

151
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,830
I didn't want you to suffer

152
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,250
a life of hardships like I did!

153
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,920
Li.

154
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,280
I did it all for you,

155
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,070
clearing away all obstacles,

156
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,090
just so you could ascend to the throne!

157
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,110
No.

158
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,280
This can't be true.

159
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,450
Li!

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,590
No!

161
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,340
This can't be true!

162
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,710
Yan Li.

163
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,640
My dear Li!

164
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,250
You wretched lackey!

165
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,720
You... You...

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,140
I'll kill you!

167
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,160
Yan Han.

168
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,950
Even your own son,

169
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,430
whom you have such high hopes for,
doesn't believe your lies.

170
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,160
When you abandoned your wife and child
back then,

171
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,360
did you ever think it would come to this?

172
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,040
You...

173
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,000
Yan Ze.

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,470
Yan Ze.

175
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,070
Yan Ze!

176
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,640
Yan Ze!

177
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,160
Li, wake up!

178
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,300
Li, wake up!

179
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,450
Li, wake up!

180
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,430
To use your son's blood

181
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,840
to complete this unrighteous flower
and send you to your deathâ€”

182
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,830
I suppose it can be considered

183
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,290
me granting a final favor
to you and your son.

184
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,470
Body sacrifice,

185
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,470
heavens tremble,

186
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,990
with flying dragons' protection,

187
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,720
immortal and indestructible!

188
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,410
Spare...

189
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,550
Spare Li.

190
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,620
I will immediately draft a decree

191
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,240
to

192
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,790
pass the throne to you.

193
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,360
Yuan Qing,

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,190
tell me,

195
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,920
should I take the throne?

196
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,400
Leader, your virtue shines bright

197
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,640
and your noble spirit reaches far.

198
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,370
You are the heaven-ordained sovereign
of the...

199
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,830
You lied to me...

200
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,590
You're all...

201
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,390
The same...

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,190
You're right.

203
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,220
Sooner or later, you'll be

204
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,470
discarded like a tool
that's served its purpose.

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
I only want the throne

206
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,080
so that everyone who enabled Yan Han

207
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,160
will pay for my parents' deaths.

208
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,280
You've helped me achieve my goal.

209
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,900
Rest in peace now.

210
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,670
How cruel is fate,

211
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,530
so many die with regrets.

212
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,560
May he in his next life

213
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
never again believe in

214
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,960
carrying out heaven's justice.

215
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:58,960
Let's go!

216
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,190
Bai Feng!

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,220
Hurry up and go!

218
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,240
Let's go!

219
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,520
The ringleader of
the Heavenly Way Society,

220
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,320
Yuan Qing, has been eliminated.

221
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,400
After today,

222
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,640
no one will know about my connection
to the Heavenly Way Society.

223
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,370
People will only remember that

224
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,240
you died at the hands of  Yuan Qing,
the traitor from the Heavenly Way Society,

225
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
and that Yuan Qing

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,260
and your precious son killed each other.

227
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,790
Except for your crimes
that will be made public,

228
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,960
all the truth

229
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,400
will vanish into thin air.

230
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,240
Li!

231
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you alright?

232
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,050
Are you alright?

233
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,480
Are you alright?

234
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
I never thought

235
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,920
that I, Yan Li, would end up

236
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,640
dying alongside you.

237
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,240
I wonder if I'll ever

238
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,190
have a chance to see Ning again.

239
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,160
If she sees me like this,

240
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,640
she'll surely be disgusted.

241
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,380
I'm here with you, Li.

242
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,310
Good.

243
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,280
I'll let you fully experience

244
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,430
what it feels like to watch
your loved ones die right before your eyes

245
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,190
and be powerless to save themâ€”

246
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,700
that heart-wrenching, gut-twisting pain.

247
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,880
Li!

248
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Wan.

249
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,070
How is

250
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,270
Li?

251
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,510
I can save him.

252
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,990
You liar! Murderer!

253
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,270
Young Marshal,
hurry and go protect His Majesty!

254
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,400
Leave this to us!

255
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,840
Master.

256
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,060
How is Sui?

257
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,990
He's all right,

258
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,120
probably just choked a bit.

259
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,880
Someone set a fire inside.

260
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
I've already put it out.

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,790
Princess Wan and Yongning
are already in the bedchamber.

262
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,750
Take good care of Sui.

263
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,470
I'll go save Princess Wan.

264
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,920
Yes.

265
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,870
Yan Li!

266
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,120
Chi.

267
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,840
He's not the Cousin Yan we knew anymore.

268
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,900
He wants to kill us!

269
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,800
Chi.

270
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,760
My father...

271
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,430
He killed His Majesty

272
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,320
and your mother.

273
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,840
And also...

274
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,880
For these sins,

275
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,830
let me pay with my life.

276
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,550
You and he are different people.

277
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,980
You must live on.

278
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,640
Master!

279
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,190
The rebels are retreating.

280
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,590
Take them all out of here.

281
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,140
-Yes!
-Be careful.

282
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,270
Here.

283
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,710
Don't worry about me.

284
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,060
Take Li away.

285
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,430
Take Li away first.

286
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,640
Here.

287
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,080
Chi.

288
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,710
Yan Han killed our parents.

289
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,560
Why are you trying to save him?

290
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,270
His crimes

291
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,350
will be judged by the law.

292
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,270
We cannot watch someone die
without helping.

293
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,080
The law?

294
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,230
Yan Han's crimes

295
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,040
are too numerous to list,

296
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,090
utterly devoid of conscience.

297
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,900
How can mere laws fully punish such evil?

298
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,950
Yuan Qing's body

299
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,430
is hardly cold,

300
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,120
yet you...

301
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,270
You're already

302
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,230
putting on

303
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,260
this righteous act

304
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,670
to cover up your crimes.

305
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,520
What a selfish and cold-hearted

306
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,460
hypocrite.

307
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,830
So it really was all carefully calculated.

308
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,320
Yan Ze

309
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,190
used the pretext of divine justice

310
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,230
to manipulate people.

311
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,950
But in fact, he used
the Heavenly Way Society

312
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,320
to cultivate power,

313
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,400
in order to plot for the imperial throne

314
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,120
and avenge

315
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,320
his personal grudge.

316
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,880
I...

317
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,730
Though I may have gained my throne
through improper means,

318
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,550
serving as

319
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,670
the ruler for years,

320
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,920
I've been

321
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,030
a diligent and benevolent emperor.

322
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,490
Diligent and benevolent?

323
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,890
Everything you've done

324
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,890
was to prove

325
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,710
that the Empress Dowager
was wrong to have abandoned you.

326
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,510
To satisfy your selfish ambition

327
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,280
to rule the world,

328
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,030
you even abandoned your wife and children,

329
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,830
betrayed your brother-in-law,

330
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,000
and plotted against
your own blood relatives.

331
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,990
You

332
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,730
are truly

333
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,470
the most vicious and cruel villain
in this world!

334
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:53,990
You...

335
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
-You both, shut up!
-How dare you...

336
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,160
What hypocrite,

337
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,750
what vicious villain,

338
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,320
you're birds of a feather.

339
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,500
No matter what reasons you have,

340
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,600
you're both nothing but murderers
with blood on your hands!

341
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,670
Those I killed

342
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,030
were all guilty!

343
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,990
They deserved to die.

344
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
I've told you,

345
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,150
their crimes should be judged by the law.

346
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,350
You're in no position to judge them.

347
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,110
Don't think you can use this

348
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,420
as an excuse to escape your guilt.

349
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,470
Think about your father.

350
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,160
Think about our mothers.

351
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,330
Are you still going to save
a sinner like Yan Han

352
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,510
and aid the wicked?

353
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,640
Yan Han must die!

354
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,790
I'll kill you...

355
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,400
Why

356
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,190
did you kill my mother...

357
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,120
You...

358
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,360
Who are you?

359
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,430
Who are you?

360
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,360
Don't come any closer.

361
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,120
Go away.

362
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,190
Go away!

363
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,660
Stay back!

364
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,920
You...

365
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,980
Don't come near me!

366
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,710
Stop pretending.

367
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,110
Come with me to Zichen Hall now

368
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,400
and expose that person's true colors.

369
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

370
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,510
I...

371
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,970
Stop playing dumb with me.

372
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,920
You think I've tolerated you
all these years

373
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,300
because I'm afraid of you?

374
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,120
I simply didn't bother

375
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
to make an enemy of a wretch like you.

376
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,670
That bastard of yours

377
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,800
caused my Che to die tragically.

378
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,120
And what fate did he meet in the end?

379
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,430
When you sought favor every day

380
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,800
and surrendered yourself to that traitor,

381
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,110
did you ever think youâ€™d end up like this?

382
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,160
What's wrong with me
surrendering to the traitor?

383
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,970
Don't you want the same?

384
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
Acting all proper and dignified.

385
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,190
If he hadn't been so guarded around you,

386
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,400
you would have dragged him
to bed long ago.

387
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,950
Do you think all women in the world

388
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,710
are as debased as you?

389
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,640
Ever since discovering that impostor
wasn't His Majesty,

390
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,070
I've been making plans,

391
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,660
just to make sure His Majesty's bloodline

392
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,860
inherits the throne.

393
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,900
And what about you?

394
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,760
All you care about
is your own power and wealth.

395
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,080
Your own son died by his hand,

396
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,230
yet you still pretended to be crazy
and fooled around just to survive.

397
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,960
How could there be a Mother like you
in this world?

398
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,270
I'm not to blame for Qi's death,

399
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,960
so why should I follow him to death?

400
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,290
What's wrong with me wanting to survive?

401
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,920
All these years,

402
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,130
he's treated me like I'm invisible,

403
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,640
lying beside me

404
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,720
without even removing his undergarments.

405
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,920
For Qi's sake,

406
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,280
I've lain beside an impostor,

407
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,350
living as a widow for over a decade.

408
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,510
What more do you want from me?

409
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,670
To preserve His Majesty's bloodline?

410
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,990
You raised your son
to be weak and incompetent,

411
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,720
just so he could be your puppet,

412
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,160
allowing you to be
the regent empress dowager.

413
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,670
Everything you've done
has been for yourself!

414
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,880
Shut your mouth!

415
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,710
The Empress is trying to kill me!

416
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,510
The Empress is trying to kill me!

417
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,840
Remember this day.

418
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,930
I'll finish you
on behalf of the late Emperor!

419
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,160
If I'm to die,

420
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,400
you won't live either!

421
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,950
I thought

422
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,360
I met a benefactor

423
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,080
when my career was over.

424
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,230
Who knew it would still
all be for nothing?

425
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,080
What a pity that I,

426
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,380
a man of such great talent,

427
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,940
have no place in this imperial court.

428
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,030
I'm leaving.

429
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:39,960
Stop right there!

430
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,730
Mr. Li.

431
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,250
Where are you going?

432
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,120
My defeat today

433
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,530
is due to the injustice of fate,

434
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,460
allowing a mediocre person like you
to succeed at every turn,

435
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,290
while I placed my trust
in the wrong person.

436
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,090
You

437
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,050
are not worthy to mock me!

438
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,190
You colluded with rebels
and betrayed your mentor,

439
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,320
yet you dare claim
our Prefect Zheng succeeds at every turn?

440
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,180
Our Prefect Zheng serves
with absolute integrity.

441
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,600
He didn't even have the money
to save his wife.

442
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,310
It was us bailiffs who chipped in.

443
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,370
I may not be as good an official as you,

444
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,600
but as a person, you're beneath me.

445
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,120
Take him away!

446
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,400
-Yes!
-Yes!

447
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,030
Please...

448
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,130
I beg you...

449
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,710
Don't

450
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,340
harm Li.

451
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,310
Li is my brother,

452
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,660
my own flesh and blood.

453
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,450
I shouldn't have...

454
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,770
I shouldn't have

455
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,990
let Yan Qi

456
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,880
kill your father.

457
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,270
I regret it,

458
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,510
but it's too late.

459
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,080
What about the late Emperor,

460
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,810
Consort Jin,

461
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,990
Prince Jin,

462
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,710
and Lord Shen's deaths?

463
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,800
Do you regret those too?

464
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,270
I...

465
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,920
If you hadn't been blinded
by imperial power,

466
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,780
none of this would have happened.

467
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,920
My parents would still be alive.

468
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,270
Your parents?

469
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,430
You are...

470
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,320
My father

471
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,080
is Shen Yi,
the Minister of Judicial Review.

472
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,460
I am Shen Yi's daughter,

473
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,810
Shen Wan.

474
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,630
My father and Prince Jin
concealed the weapon

475
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,600
to cover up your murder of Consort Jin,

476
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,710
to prevent it from becoming public

477
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,800
and avoid causing turmoil in the court.

478
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,660
Yet you wrongfully killed a loyal official
who saw you as a wise ruler.

479
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,560
It was my fault.

480
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,870
My fault.

481
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,120
I was wrong...

482
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,640
One wrong step

483
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,800
leads

484
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,470
to many more.

485
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,510
I...

486
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,270
I've...

487
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,380
I've...

488
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:12,750
I've

489
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,300
wronged...

490
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,040
[Prince Yi's Mansion]

491
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,660
[Fu Residence]

492
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,880
â™ª If my tears could speak â™ª

493
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,050
â™ª If you could hear my heart melt â™ª

494
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,460
â™ª If I no longer needed â™ª

495
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,510
â™ª To hold onto the broken dreams â™ª

496
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,389
â™ª Maybe then I could finally
let go of regret â™ª

497
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,650
â™ª Don't sigh for me â™ª

498
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,170
â™ª Or for our love song
that's come to an end â™ª

499
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:32,570
â™ª Memories feel just like
the songs I once sang for you â™ª

500
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,780
â™ª I sigh for the dark night
and the cold moon â™ª

501
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,130
â™ª I sigh for all the loneliness
in this world â™ª

502
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:45,620
â™ª Even true love
can't resist the passing of time â™ª

503
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:54,110
â™ª Even true love
can't resist the passing of time â™ª

504
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,460
Ever since he returned to the palace,

505
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,679
I knew he wasn't Huai.

506
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
But what difference does it make?

507
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,950
I'm not only a mother,

508
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,140
but also the Empress Dowager
of our country.

509
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,750
He's diligent and disciplined,

510
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,550
with decisive authority.

511
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,110
He's more suitable

512
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,590
to be emperor than Huai.

513
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,430
I had thought

514
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,080
if the court could truly be well-governed,

515
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,130
then passing the throne to Che

516
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,900
would be returning to
the rightful succession.

517
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,160
Who would have known

518
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,720
that one wrong step

519
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,300
would lead to mistake after mistake?

520
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,320
Grandmother, you've done nothing wrong.

521
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,520
It's the imperial rules that are wrong.

522
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,720
My mistake was with Han.

523
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,810
First mistake,

524
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,550
I shouldn't have been so soft-hearted

525
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,770
and spared his life.

526
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,960
Second mistake,

527
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,170
after he returned to the palace,

528
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,630
I shouldn't have deceived myself.

529
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,990
I was wrong from the very beginning.

530
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,360
Grandmother, please don't blame yourself.

531
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,240
If you hadn't made these two mistakes,

532
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,170
Yan Li and Sui wouldn't be here now.

533
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,480
Letting Sui

534
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,760
inherit the throne

535
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,830
is also for the sake of the empire.

536
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,720
You two won't

537
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,040
resent me

538
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,380
for making such a decision, will you?

539
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,590
Li and I never desired that position.

540
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,590
We have no resentment at all.

541
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,650
In fact, it's exactly what we wanted.

542
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,470
All I want is Wan as my wife,

543
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,170
and Shuoxi as my domain.

544
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,180
I ask for nothing else.

545
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,150
Good.

546
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,690
Help Sui for a few more years.

547
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,150
I'll surely fulfill your wishes.

548
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,980
Have a seat.

549
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,620
How is the Empress Dowager doing?

550
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,520
Grandmother still grieves,

551
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,760
but her depression has lifted.

552
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,890
She will get better.

553
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,200
That's good.

554
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,360
With you two by her side,

555
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,240
I can return to Jingzhou
with peace of mind.

556
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,430
Great Aunt, why are you
in such a hurry to leave?

557
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,560
Wan and I haven't had the chance
to properly care for you.

558
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,550
You don't need to care for me.

559
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,990
Just treat Wan well.

560
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,570
That's what matters most.

561
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,410
Grandma.

562
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,590
Thank you.

563
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Thank me for what?

564
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,230
If anything,

565
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,450
you saved my life twice,

566
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,240
and I should be thanking you.

567
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,890
Actually, at first,

568
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,420
I had intentions of using connections.

569
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,900
But Grandma, you've always been
sincere and genuine with me,

570
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,670
never showing any suspicion.

571
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,550
I don't like

572
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,680
hearing such talk.

573
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,630
What do you mean by "using connections"?

574
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,240
Using connections means taking advantage

575
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,400
of others for personal gain.

576
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,130
You rely on your own abilities,

577
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,940
and you're so kind-hearted.

578
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,180
That's why I love and cherish you.

579
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,060
This is the bond between us.

580
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,590
Whether you're Qin Wan or Shen Wan,

581
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,470
you will always be

582
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,240
my most beloved granddaughter.

583
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,960
â™ª A deep mark you left,
etched in my heart â™ª

584
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,920
Grandma.

585
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,780
â™ª Now and then it aches,
stirring old memories â™ª

586
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,860
Alright, alright.

587
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,450
â™ª Turning into something
I'll never forget â™ª

588
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,140
â™ª In the long journey of life â™ª

589
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,670
â™ª The meaning of encounters
can never be defined â™ª

590
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,950
Your hand.

591
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:04,460
â™ª The story isn't over yet,
and tears are not the only part of it â™ª

592
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,110
From now on,

593
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,090
I'll entrust Wan to you.

594
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,730
â™ª Turn love into a secret,
hidden deep inside â™ª

595
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,470
Remember, I'm not too old to walk yet.

596
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,630
If

597
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,200
you dare let my Wan

598
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,690
â™ª Collecting moments
as we pass by each other â™ª

599
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,030
suffer even the slightest grievance,

600
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,680
I'll show up in front of you
anytime, anywhere

601
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,510
â™ª To look back on when I grow old â™ª

602
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,520
to teach you a lesson.

603
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,570
Great Aunt, if that's your only reason
for returning to the capital,

604
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,930
I'm afraid there won't be
such an opportunity.

605
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:27,200
â™ª Turn love into a secret,
hidden deep inside â™ª

606
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Wan! Wan!

607
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,390
â™ª If you unveil the mystery â™ª

608
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:37,610
â™ª And walk through this journey with me â™ª

609
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:48,300
â™ª That would be the best ending for love â™ª

610
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,890
Go ahead.

611
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,940
The late Emperor's edict:

612
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,110
My young son, Yan Sui,

613
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,080
is naturally kind and generous,

614
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,890
filial and sincere.

615
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,220
He now succeeds to the throne,

616
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,930
rules over the realm,

617
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,360
bestowed with the mandate of Heaven,

618
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,510
assumes the imperial position
in this world,

619
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,360
hereby proclaimed to all under heaven.

620
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,860
Prince Rui, Yan Chi,

621
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,360
is of noble character,

622
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,130
wise and filial,

623
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,680
quelled chaos and laid down arms,

624
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,470
defended the palace
and saved the late Emperor,

625
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,150
and achieved great merits.

626
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,990
He's hereby

627
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,820
appointed as Regent,

628
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,410
to assist the successor,

629
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,950
united in purpose,

630
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,240
following the path of past sages.

631
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,240
Rise.

632
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

633
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,150
When you return to Jingzhou,

634
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,590
take good care of Grandma,

635
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,470
and take even better care of yourself.

636
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,350
Forget all those past events and people.

637
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,120
Don't worry.

638
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,890
I won't make things hard for myself.

639
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,490
Yan Ze lost his life
due to his own inner demons.

640
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,840
I no longer owe him anything.

641
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,530
I just need some time

642
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,650
to figure out what kind of life I want.

643
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,930
That's the best way to think about it.

644
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,150
Could you help me deliver something?

645
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,030
To whom?

646
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:46,070
If you don't come down soon,
the boat's going to leave.

647
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,070
Coming!

648
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,530
Coming!

649
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,340
Ning.

650
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,110
I'm here.

651
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,780
So this is what she meant.

652
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,780
I've always seen Yan Li
as a sister since childhood.

653
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,110
You must treat him well.

654
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,150
Sister?

655
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,920
You can slap his face,

656
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,320
but don't bruise it,

657
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,820
or he'll cry.

658
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,950
Don't worry, Chi.

659
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Just for the sake of his pretty face,

660
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,680
I'll go easy on him.

661
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,490
While he's still young and beautiful,

662
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,680
hurry up and get married,

663
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,810
or you'll miss his prime and regret it.

664
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,030
Is there something on my face?

665
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,510
Little Wan'er is right.

666
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
I shouldn't miss your prime.

667
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,470
Don't worry, my beauty is timeless.

668
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,680
So do you want to get married soon or not?

669
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,480
Of course I do.

670
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,440
We'll be leaving now.

671
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,130
Have you set a date?

672
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,260
-Yes.
-No.

673
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,440
Princess Wan, please don't mock us.

674
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,190
You've always been so wishy-washy.

675
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,990
When asked about marriage,
you flatly deny it.

676
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,500
Do you believe
I'll send you to guard the border?

677
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,500
No, please don't.

678
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,980
The date is set.

679
