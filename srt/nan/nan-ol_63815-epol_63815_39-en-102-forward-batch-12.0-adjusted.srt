45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,390
I am carrying out an imperial edict

46
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,550
to arrest the criminal Zheng Xinghuai.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,630

50
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,640
Hear me out.

51
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,240
Hear me out.

52
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,520
I never

53
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,080
colluded with the Kui.

54
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,670
Nor have I ever deceived His Majesty.

55
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll go with you.

56
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,960
I have a clear conscience.

57
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,230
Mr. Zheng,

58
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,320
they're coming at you.

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,920
There will be danger if you go.

60
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,200
My Lord,

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,150
I understand.

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,760
But

63
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,670
this concerns only me.

64
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,590
Thank you, Lord Wei.

65
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,990
Thank you all

66
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,520
for your efforts on my behalf.

67
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,390
I don't deserve

68
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,040
such kindness.

69
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,830
There will always be justice
in the world.

70
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,960
Right and wrong will be clear
in the end.

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,670
I'll be back soon.

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,550
Wise choice.

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
Take him away.

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
Xu Qi'an,

75
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,320
State Duke Cao took away

76
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,780
the old man you asked me to treat.

77
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,680
Before he left,

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,270
he asked me to give you this.

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,100
(Take things slow)

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,580
(Court of Judicial Review)

81
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,320
What a beast.

82
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,230
That's right.

83
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,030
I am a beast.

84
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,790
I am the one

85
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,790
who killed your entire family.

86
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,830
But now,

87
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,350
you are the criminal
who's committed treason

88
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,390
and colluded with the Kui.

89
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,150
Are you going to admit it?

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,710
You want to pin this on me,

91
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,560
but I'll never surrender.

92
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,250
Aren't you so high and mighty?

93
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
Kneel.

94
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,830
Mr. Zheng.

95
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,030
You are just a dog.

96
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,560
Old man.

97
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,270
How dare you get up?

98
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,590
Do not rise.

99
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,110
Hit him.

100
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,470
You want to move, huh?

101
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,150
Mr. Zheng.

102
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,230
Sorry.

103
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,460
Enough.

104
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,900
Finish what you need to do and leave.

105
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,180
Delays will cause complications.

106
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,080
Wake him up.

107
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,760
Old man.

108
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,880
Old fool,

109
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,590
I'll tell you the truth before you die.

110
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,030
The mess you caused these days

111
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,320
has extremely upset His Majesty.

112
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,590
If not for your remaining use,

113
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,150
you'd already have died quietly.

114
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,030
Zheng Xinghuai,

115
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,320
you're not smart enough.

116
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,830
If you had thought carefully

117
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,990
about everything
that happened in Chuzhou,

118
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,230
you would've known

119
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
who you were

120
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,110
really facing.

121
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,320
Come on.

122
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,830
Mr. Zheng,

123
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,080
the time has come.

124
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,080
It's time to die.

125
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,630
Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner of Chuzhou,

126
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,590
colluded with the Kui

127
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,920
and slaughtered 380,000 commoners.

128
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,280
After being exposed by Que Yongxiu,
State Duke of Protection,

129
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,440
he hanged himself

130
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,750
in prison.

131
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,280
Mr. Zheng,

132
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
are you satisfied

133
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,870
with this outcome?

134
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,610
He only sought political achievements

135
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,350
but witnessed both the decay

136
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,080
and vibrancy

137
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
of people's lives.

138
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,870
He once loved to frequent a street

139
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,320
because of a bowl
of plain noodles there.

140
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,440
(Plain Noodles)
Mr. Zheng,

141
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,350
long time no see.

142
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,560
Have some noodles.

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,280
The broth today is especially good.

144
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,920
Later,

145
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
(Plain Buns)
- he discovered - Mr. Zheng, hello.

146
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,060
- the plain buns there
- Have some fresh plain buns.

147
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,680
were also tasty.

148
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
- It's so delicious.
- Really?

149
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,660
He saw the widow in the west

150
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,250
remarry.

151
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,590
He saw the kids wiping their noses
growing up.

152
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,910
(Barbecue)
How about some lamb?

153
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,990
He helped his father
run a lamb skewer stand.

154
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,280
For over twenty years,

155
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,040
he met many people there.

156
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,680
He walked
through every street and alley.

157
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,440
There was no lingering romance
of Jiangnan

158
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,350
or prosperity of the capital.

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,470
- But in time,
- Mr. Zheng, hello.

160
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,400
that place became his home.

161
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,500
(Zheng Xinghuai's mother)

162
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,710

I'm back.

Hurry and eat.

165
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,510
He decided

166
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,860

into the capital.

you paid with your own life.

190
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,830
Didn't I already tell you?

191
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,990
Take things slow.

192
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,470
Xu Qi'an is truly lawless,

193
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
breaking into the dungeon.

194
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,470
I should arrest him right now.

195
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,630
Hand over Mr. Zheng to us first.

196
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,990
After our investigation,

197
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,030
we'll trial him together.

198
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,920
Xu Qi'an,

199
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,320
how dare you

200
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,350
break into our dungeon!

201
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,110
Even if I kill you here,

202
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,830
Wei Yuan won't say anything.

203
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,350
Take him down!

204
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,350
Who dares to do so?

205
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,560
Everyone, stop!

206
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Xu Qi'an,

207
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,800
what are you doing here?

208
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,280
Such a big case is

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,160
beyond the control
of a Silver Gong like you.

210
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,710
Leave now.

211
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
Your Majesty,

212
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,800
Zheng Xinghuai is dead.

213
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,800
This case can be closed.

214
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,230
But

215
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,440
how should we explain it

216
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,440
to the officials?

217
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,710
I will send a group of imperial guards

218
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,320
to your mansion

219
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,040
to protect you.

220
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,800
You don't need to worry
about assassination.

221
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,710
Also,

222
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,990
the secret spies you brought back

223
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,830
can be temporarily under your command

224
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,560
and stay at your mansion.

225
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,800
Your Majesty,

226
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,280
how wise and mighty of you.

227
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,750
With a smooth strike,

228
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,560
you'd shaken the civil officials.

229
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,080
While they hesitated,

230
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,750
you resolved the mess swiftly

231
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,590
and made Zheng Xinghuai
commit suicide out of guilt,

232
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,160
leaving no way out for the officials.

233
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Now,

234
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,710
they can only accept it.

235
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,080
But

236
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,630
the Supreme Sword was lost.

237
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,230
And we don't know
where that mysterious man is.

238
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,070
If we can find him again,

239
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,160
retrieve the sword,

240
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,640
and avenge Duke Huai,

241
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,480
this matter

242
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,360
can be resolved completely.

243
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,990
Tomorrow, I'll convene a court meeting

244
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,790
to finalize the Chuzhou Case.

245
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,160
Before that,

246
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,790
spread the news that Zheng Xinghuai

247
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
committed suicide out of guilt.

248
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,800
Understood.

249
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,540
(Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner
of Chuzhou, died in prison.)

250
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,960
So,

251
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,920
this was Father's backup plan.

252
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,870
Huaiqing.

253
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
Why do you look like this?

254
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
I heard

255
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,680
Mr. Zheng is dead. Is it true?

256
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,710
I'm scared.

257
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,350
Scared of what?

258
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,310
I'm scared that Xu Qi'an will...

259
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,710
Who's there? It's so late.

260
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,040
Mother.

261
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,280
Cijiu.

262
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,230
What's wrong?

263
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,310
Has Ningyan come back?

264
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Not yet.

265
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,390
What's wrong?

266
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,550
Mr. Zheng was killed.

267
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,550
Mr. Zheng?

268
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,440
We must find him quickly.

269
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,750
Have you seen a man wearing a crown?

270
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,440
Thank you.

271
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Mr. Chu.

272
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
Did you find him?

273
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,910
No.

274
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,680
Keep looking.

275
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,440
Ningyan!

276
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,120
Have you seen someone

277
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,440
about my height in Guardian clothes?

278
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
We've gone to the Bureau and the yamen.

279
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,710
Where could Xu Qi'an have gone?

280
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,150
Sir,

281
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,270
you've been playing all night.

282
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,440
My small business

283
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,030
has nothing more to offer.

284
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
Xu Qi'an.

285
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,390
Mr. Xu.

286
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,610
We've been searching for you all night.

287
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,520
Where did you go?

288
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,440
To avoid the rain

289
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,350
and to think.

290
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,640
How did it go?

291
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,160
I've figured it out.

292
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,510
Now, I'll go back to sleep

293
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,840
and have a good meal.

294
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,350
I'm leaving.

295
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
By the way, Mr. Chu,

296
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,310
I remembered the two lines.

297
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,400
Do you still want them?

298
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,400
Little one,

299
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,200
eat more.

300
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,440
Thank you, Ningyan.

301
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,110
Sis,

302
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,390
have some too.

303
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,550
Eat meat.

304
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,070
Why are you all staring at me?

305
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,120
Eat.

306
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,400
Sure.

307
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,550
Where did you go last night?

308
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,870
Playing ring toss.

309
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,200
Playing ring toss?

310
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,240
Yeah.

311
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,350
I'm full.

312
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Cijiu,

313
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,190
I won't compete with you.

314
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,040
Where are you going?

315
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,400
Going to take a bath in my room.

Your Majesty,

340
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,990
I have something to report.

341
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,520
Speak.

342
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,520
Your Majesty,

343
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner of Chuzhou,

344
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,470
committed suicide in prison

345
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,710
at noon yesterday

346
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,400
out of guilt.

347
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,470
Out of guilt?

348
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,990
What does everyone think?

349
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,360
How should this case be concluded?

350
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,630
Your Majesty,

351
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,190
since Zheng Xinghuai has
committed suicide out of guilt,

352
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,440
this case can be closed.

353
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,360
Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner of Chuzhou,

354
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,790
from Zhangzhou,

355
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,160
an A-II Presented Scholar
in Yuanjing Year 19,

356
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,200
colluded with the Kui
to murder Duke Zhenbei

357
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,640
and 380,000 commoners of Chuzhou.

358
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,990
His crimes are heinous.

359
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,510
Nine families of him shall be executed.

360
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,920
Does he have any relatives left?

361
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,470
This man is alone.

362
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,070
His family is gone.

363
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
Is this conclusion

364
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,120
acceptable to everyone?

365
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,360
Dismiss the court.

366
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,120
Your Majesty, farewell.

367
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,840
Who is it?

368
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,310
Xu Qi'an.

369
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,370
You cannot enter without being summoned.

370
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,640
Mr. Xu,

371
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,710
what brings you here?

372
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,140
To seek justice.

373
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,120
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

374
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,280
Lord Wei.

375
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,890
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

376
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,630
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

377
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,030
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

378
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,200
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

379
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,470
A wise strategist

380
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,790
must know patience.

381
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,920
Reckless courage,

382
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,790
though it's satisfying for a moment,

383
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,440
can cost you much more.

384
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,640
The time is not right.

385
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,550
Go back.

386
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,880
Lord Wei and I

387
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,550
are fundamentally different.

388
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
You serve in the imperial court,

389
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,880
overseeing the bigger picture.

390
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,960
You're skilled in patience

391
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
and adept at compromise.

392
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,520
But I

393
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,270
am just a Fighter.

394
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,680
I cannot manage the bigger picture

395
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,680
or do anything else.

396
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,160
All I can do is strike decisively,

397
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,920
clearing my conscience

398
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,780
and staying true to my heart.

399
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,270
Mr. Zheng gave me this before,

400
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,880
but I believe

401
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,440
it suits you better.

402
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,940
(Take things slow.)

403
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,840
State Duke Cao,

404
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,960
shall we go to the Imperial Office
of Music tonight?

405
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,400
After all these years in Chuzhou,

406
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,880
I've forgotten
how pretty the music girls are.

407
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,600
These days, don't leave your house.

408
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,230
Just stay at your mansion.

409
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,360
Xu Qi'an?

410
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,590
Xu Qi'an,

411
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,160
this is the Imperial Palace.

412
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,920
What do you need a knife for?

413
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,910
Xu Qi'an,

414
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,880
do you know what crime you've committed

415
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,990
by carrying a weapon
and trespassing into the Palace?

416
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,790
Xu Qi'an,

417
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,990
don't ruin yourself.

418
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,270
You can't fight here.

419
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,790
You can't afford the consequences.

420
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,920
Is he Xu Qi'an, who investigated

421
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,070
the Bloodshed Case?

422
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,390
Yes,

423
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,400
it's him.

424
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,550
Que Yongxiu,

425
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,030
State Duke Cao,

426
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,710
come here.

427
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
If I kill him here,

428
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
will His Majesty blame me?

429
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,200
His cultivation is too great
to be underestimated.

430
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,230
I am the one you're looking for.

431
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,310
What do you want to do?

432
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,400
Lord Wei,

433
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,880
your teaching skills are insufficient.

434
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,070
Look at this lawless young man.

435
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,440
How dare he carry a weapon
in the Palace?

436
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,400
If you can't teach him,

437
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,920
I'll teach him for you.

438
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,540
(Restraining Spell)

439
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,310
Someone broke into the Palace!

440
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,040
Close the gates
and protect His Majesty!

441
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,170
Let's go.

442
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,910
Don't go!

443
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,030
Come back! Don't leave!

444
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,110
Lord Wei,

445
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,840
as a fellow official,

446
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,440
you can't ignore this.

447
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,640
Xu Qi'an,

448
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,790
don't come over! Calm down!

449
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,910
Xu Qi'an!

450
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,120
Imperial Guards.

451
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,330
Where are the Imperial Guards?

452
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,440
Take him down!

453
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,660
The Imperial Guards
only follow His Majesty's orders.

454
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,630
Turn around.

455
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,040
Imperial Guards,

456
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,440
you can't ignore this!

457
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,710
Xu Qi'an, you...

458
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,710
Don't, Mr. Xu.

459
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,070
Mr. Xu.

460
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,000
Lord Wei!

461
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,750
Lord Wei!

462
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,640
Help me!

463
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,880
Help me!

464
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,550
Xu Qi'an, stop!

465
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,440
I am the State Duke of Protection!

466
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,400
Lord Wei!

467
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,750
- Help me!
- Lord Wei, help me!

468
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,120
Where are the Imperial Guards?

469
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,960
Imperial Guards!

470
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,790
Lord Wei!

471
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,550
They're just paying

472
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,920
for their grave sins.

473
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,550
Help me!

474
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,510
Your Majesty!

475
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,590
Your Majesty!

476
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,070
Your Majesty!

477
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,310
This is terrible!

478
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,030
Xu Qi'an captured State Duke Cao

479
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,370
and the State Duke of Protection
at the Meridian Gate.

480
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,600
He even talked

481
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,030
about killing them!

482
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,030
Is he planning to rebel?

483
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,310
How are things with State Duke Cao

484
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,010
and the State Duke of Protection now?

485
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,610
They've been taken out of the Palace.

486
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,360
Hurry and stop him!

487
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,030
If anyone resists,

488
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,550
kill them on the spot!

489
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,480
Yes!

490
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,840
How dare he defy me!

491
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,030
How rebellious!

492
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,400
How rebellious!

493
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,390
Mr. Xu,

494
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,630
how about

495
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,930
I treat you to a bowl of plain noodles?

496
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,970
I'm over fifty,

497
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,120
reaching the age of knowing my fate.

498
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,120
I've never had grand ambitions.

499
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,230
I just wanted to take care of my mother,

500
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,030
spend time with my kids and grandkids,

501
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,440
and keep Chuzhou peaceful.

502
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,990
But overnight,

503
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,600
Chuzhou was lost,

504
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,830
and those people

505
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,960
were all dead.

506
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,710
Maybe Lord Wei is right

507
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,160
about taking things slow.

508
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,270
But

509
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,270
I can't stop.

510
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,070
Chu Yuanzhen,

511
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,470
are you planning to rebel

512
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,850
and become a wanted criminal?

513
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,120
I spent ten years

514
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,510
sharpening my sword.

515
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,230
Its edge

516
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
has never been tested.

517
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,470
Today,

518
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,070
it's shown to the world.

519
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,030
Who

520
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,560
needs

521
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,360
help

522
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,720
with grievances?

523
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,470
His Majesty has ordered

524
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,920
that anyone who resists

525
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,030
be killed on the spot.

526
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,400
Try me!

527
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,590
This time,

528
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,400
we've really stirred up a hornet's nest.

529
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,840
Leave if you're afraid.

530
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,550
I'm here.

531
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,550
How could I

532
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,800
not be part of this?

533
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,960
Isn't this Mr. Xu?

534
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,800
Yeah.

535
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,280
Who are those two?

536
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,350
The one-eyed man is

537
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,320
Que Yongxiu, State Duke of Protection.

538
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,430
Look.

539
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,540
With so many people here,

540
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,510
your death will be worth it.

541
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,360
He accused Zheng Xinghuai,
Commissioner of Chuzhou,

542
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,320
of colluding with the Kui
to murder Duke Zhenbei.

543
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,760
Yeah, how could they do this?

544
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,590
What's happening?

545
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,190
It's probably about the Chuzhou Case.

546
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,630
I'm a Tier I Duke,

547
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,240
a descendant of a founding hero.

548
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,630
If you kill me,

549
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,150
you won't have a place
in the Dafeng anymore.

550
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,240
When I meet His Majesty,

551
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I will surely beg him

552
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,470
to forgive you.

553
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Mr. Xu,

554
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
please spare me.

555
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,070
It was Duke Zhenbei
and the State Duke of Protection.

556
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,800
They slaughtered the city.

557
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,840
They did it.

558
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,030
It has nothing to do with me!

559
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,110
- Nonsense!
- You're the one talking nonsense!

560
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,190
You weren't in the capital.

561
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,720
You don't know him.

562
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,560
He's a madman.

563
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,190
He really will kill us.

564
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,720
Please don't!

565
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,080
Speak louder.

566
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,240
Tell the people.

567
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,470
Who was it

568
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,630
that massacred Chuzhou?

569
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,280
It was Duke Zhenbei

570
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,670
and the State Duke of Protection
who massacred the city!

571
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,030
It was them!

572
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,880
Who would've thought of that?

573
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,830
That's not enough.

574
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,840
Zheng Xinghuai...

575
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,150
He was innocent.

576
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,320
Everything he said was the truth.

577
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,800
I've said it. Please don't kill me!

578
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
So, it was Duke Zhenbei and Que Yongxiu

579
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,670
who slaughtered the Chuzhou people!

580
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,510
No wonder Mr. Zheng died.

581
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,360
It was you two who caused it.

582
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,760
Que Yongxiu

583
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,470
is trying to cover up the truth.

584
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,280
Kill him!

585
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,110
- Don't!
- Kill him!

586
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,030
Kill him!

587
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,720
Avenge Mr. Zheng!

588
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:53,920
Kill him!

589
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,600
Help!

590
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,640
Help me!

591
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,190
Come and save me!

592
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,240
His Majesty has ordered

593
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,840
to capture Xu Qi'an!

594
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,150
Come and save me!

595
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,960
Come and save me!

596
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,240
Take him down!

597
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,150
Save me...

598
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,920
Xu Qi'an,

599
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,360
what do you want to do?

600
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,720
Seize him!
