[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,970
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,380
Teeth marks.

4
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,660
Before Miss Song got married,

5
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,460
she might've had a secret lover.

6
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,020
Xu He.

7
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,330
Shut up. Get out!

8
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,680
A secret lover?

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,770
Are you sure about that?

10
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,710
Miss Qin,

11
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,250
you can't make up things like that.

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,560
Please take a look.

13
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,420
This is an old wound.

14
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,410
On the skin that hasn't rotted,

15
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,700
you can see
two symmetrical crescents of black dots.

16
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,100
The upper dots are longer and darker

17
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,850
because upper teeth are bigger

18
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,990
and more widely spaced.

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,780
They leave deeper marks.

20
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,340
This is a bite.

21
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,470
A contusion caused by human teeth.

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,960
Even if it was a bite,

23
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,570
couldn't it have come from a fight

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,780
between women?

25
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,390
Men and women have different jaw widths.

26
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,850
If this had happened in a fight,

27
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,850
the victim would've struggled or dodged.

28
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,780
The wound and its location
would've been different.

29
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,250
Yes.

30
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,380
Besides, Song Rou was the daughter
of the Duke of Song.

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,100
No one would've dared offend her,

32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,700
let alone bite her like this.

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,690
But you can't conclude

34
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,290
she had an affair

35
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,820
based solely on a bite mark.

36
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,320
There were also the termites.

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,810
They feed on rotting wood

38
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,829
and rarely attack living things.

39
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,940
The only reason
they appeared near her private parts

40
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,510
is because she once
lay naked near their nest.

41
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,570
Do you think she was sexually assaulted?

42
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,500
If she were, why didn't she cry out?

43
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,860
The escort guards could've heard her.

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,440
On the wedding day,

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,510
she was carried into Jingzhou
in her bridal palanquin.

46
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,290
The only chance
would've been the night before.

47
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,780
If it hadn't been someone close to her,

48
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,880
why would she have gone
to the banyan woods alone at night?

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,510
Miss Song died so horribly.

50
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,380
Why did no one
in the huge escort team notice a thing?

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,090
Even worse,

52
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,350
someone tried to play tricks
at the Marquis Mansion

53
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,590
to mess with my head.

54
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,730
It must have been someone
from the escort team.

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,829
Do you think the servants

56
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,510
were trying to cover things up
to avoid punishment

57
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,040
for failing to protect her?

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,650
That's understandable.

59
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,900
You have a point.

60
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,060
Prefect Huo, please authorize an autopsy

61
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,660
so I can find solid evidence.

62
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,620
What?

63
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,940
An autopsy?

64
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,180
Absolutely not.

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,170
Absolutely not.

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,380
The Duke of Song would never agree to it.

67
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,130
Prefect Huo,

68
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,620
Song Rou was supposed to stay home

69
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,570
for marriage preparations
these past few months.

70
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,600
If she had lost her virginity
before the wedding

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,250
yet still planned
to marry into the Yue family,

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,130
that would mean the Duke

73
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,329
had no respect for either the Yue family

74
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,820
or His Majesty.

75
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,850
This is a serious matter.

76
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,730
You've been a prefect for years.

77
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,190
You surely know what to do.

78
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,560
I'll reinvestigate everyone
in the escort team

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,220
and convince Wei Yanzhi
to approve the autopsy.

80
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,810
I'll take my leave.

81
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,450
Things are bound to turn ugly

82
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,250
between the Duke of Song
and the Yue family.

83
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,380
Before the autopsy,

84
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,940
please don't tell anyone about

85
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,140
Song Rou's possible loss of virginity.

86
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,770
Coroners who leak examination details

87
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,860
will be whipped 100 times.

88
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,190
I may not be an official,

89
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,970
but I know the rules of postmortems.

90
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,570
Don't worry, Your Highness.

91
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
Coroner Xu,

92
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,890
place the body with the table
it lies on into the empty coffin.

93
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,180
Surround the body

94
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,159
with peppercorns and charcoal
before sealing the coffin.

95
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,130
Place extra ice basins around the coffin

96
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,450
to slow down decomposition

97
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,740
for the third examination.

98
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,400
Yes.

99
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,600
One more thing.

100
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,970
Have our men in the capital carefully
check the Song family's inner quarters.

101
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,100
The inner quarters?

102
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,060
You mean

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,660
Song Rou was misbehaving?

104
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,450
Looks like I have to
send you back to boot camp

105
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,780
to relearn discipline.

106
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,130
Forgive me, Master.

107
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,210
I'd rather run ten laps around Jingzhou

108
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,740
than be apart from you.

109
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,450
You get it, don't you?

110
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,110
Miss Qin, take care.

111
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,140
General Bai has urgent matters to report.

112
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,470
Let's not disturb them.

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,120
What a surprise. Besides me,

114
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,180
there's actually someone else
the sweet-talking,

115
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,580
tough General Bai fears.

116
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,890
Master, stop calling me General.

117
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,810
When you call me that,

118
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,210
it makes my knees go weak.

119
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,080
Autopsy?

120
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,910
Prefect Huo,

121
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,810
you know the position I'm in.

122
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I really

123
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,980
can't explain this to the Duke.

124
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,750
If this case remains unsolved,

125
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,170
the Duke,

126
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,210
the Marquis,

127
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,370
and even you and I—

128
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,050
none of us
will be able to answer to His Majesty.

129
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,860
You're right.

130
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,720
-But…
-Father!

131
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,510
I found the crime scene.

132
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,500
Where?

133
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,010
At the posthouse at Shili Temple.

134
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,340
Just like Miss Qin said,

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,380
there really are banyan woods beside it.

136
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,060
We found traces of blood
next to some dry branches

137
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,120
in a secluded spot.

138
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,460
Did you find Rou's head?

139
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,820
No.

140
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,390
We searched the entire woods

141
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,380
but couldn't find it.

142
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,640
Could it have been taken by a wild animal?

143
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,390
Shili Temple is the closest posthouse
to Jingzhou,

144
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,860
with lots of people coming and going.

145
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,060
Unless it's the dead of winter
when food is scarce,

146
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,830
wild animals wouldn't come near.

147
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,190
It's also possible
that the killer took it.

148
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,550
But why would they want her head?

149
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,710
Maybe

150
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,610
to cover up the evidence.

151
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,220
I failed at my job.

152
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,970
Vice Commandant Wei,

153
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,620
please have the Duke of Song write me

154
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,220
a letter as soon as possible.

155
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,060
After all, whether he agrees
to the autopsy or not,

156
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,570
I have to report to His Majesty

157
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,130
and the Yue family.

158
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,150
I'll take my leave.

159
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,690
Your Highness,

160
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,770
this is such a smart move.

161
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,450
With the Duke of Song's letter,

162
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,780
I won't be blamed for
not performing the necessary autopsy.

163
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,960
The blame falls entirely on him now.

164
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,250
According to criminal law,

165
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,650
not performing an autopsy when necessary
is a violation of imperial protocol.

166
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,930
It's meant to prevent coroners

167
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,850
from being lazy or evasive.

168
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,950
Finding a scapegoat
isn't something to celebrate.

169
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,770
It's just how things played out.

170
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,140
I'm not trying to dodge responsibility.

171
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,670
Miss Qin said that

172
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,090
out of a sense of justice.

173
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,090
Prefect Huo, don't take it to heart.

174
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,060
I've dealt with the Duke of Song for you.

175
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,450
But you have to handle
the Marquis of Anyang yourself.

176
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,250
After all,

177
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,090
what the Yue family wants

178
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,130
is just the truth.

179
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,860
Alright.

180
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,560
I'll go question
the escort team right away.

181
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,780
Farewell.

182
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,170
Take care.

183
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,950
Son,

184
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,580
you should focus on your studies.

185
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,050
Qin Wan is too far above us.

186
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,680
She's out of your league.

187
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,070
Fuling.

188
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,760
Get in. We're going back
to the Marquis Mansion.

189
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,420
You upset Miss Qin?

190
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,970
She looks furious.

191
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,490
You can start running ten laps

192
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,690
around Jingzhou now!

193
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,180
Wait, Master.

194
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,820
I...

195
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,420
Well...

196
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,790
I know it's hard to hear,

197
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,020
but when you upset a girl,

198
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,260
you have to win her back fast.

199
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,920
If you wait until the next day,
it'll be too late!

200
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,350
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

201
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,690
Miss Qin!

202
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,060
Miss Qin.

203
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,020
Are you upset that

204
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,750
I used the Duke of Song's letter

205
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,020
to let Huo Huaixin off the hook?

206
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,620
Yes.

207
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,820
Even if Prefect Huo
fears the Duke's power,

208
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,300
with a little pressure from you,

209
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,700
he might've had the courage
to take responsibility.

210
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,730
Do you think he's
only afraid of approving the autopsy?

211
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,100
What he truly fears is that
you'll uncover evidence

212
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,790
that Song Rou had an affair

213
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,610
and the Duke of Song
will take it out on him.

214
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,660
Then why did Your Highness

215
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,720
still let Prefect Huo shirk his duty?

216
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,970
Is a human life

217
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,940
worth less than his official title?

218
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,740
Because you found the bite mark.

219
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,530
His Majesty has paid attention
to this case.

220
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,660
Even if the bite mark

221
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,190
isn't definitive proof
of Song Rou's affair,

222
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,590
it's enough to raise suspicion.

223
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,730
If I submit the re-examination report

224
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,610
along with the Duke's letter…

225
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,950
His Majesty will suspect

226
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,940
the Duke wants to
obstruct the investigation.

227
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,540
If His Majesty
orders a thorough investigation,

228
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,200
what can the Duke possibly do?

229
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,120
I've wronged you, Your Highness.

230
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,430
Please punish me.

231
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,210
No need.

232
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,180
I only acted according to the situation.

233
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,020
It's nothing.

234
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,160
But

235
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,500
I do hope, from now on,

236
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,180
you can be honest

237
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,550
and open with me.

238
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,540
I can't shake the feeling

239
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,260
that Wei Yanzhi is suspicious.

240
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,030
He acted heartbroken just now,

241
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,550
but he couldn't even look me in the eye.

242
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,230
I'll have someone watch him—

243
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,020
see if he'll really
send a letter to the Duke.

244
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,250
Tomorrow is the 15th.
There will be a lantern fair.

245
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,420
He doesn't know I've found out

246
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,020
Miss Song had a secret lover.

247
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,550
Your Highness, please spread the word

248
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,690
that I plan to do
a third examination in a few days.

249
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,540
At the fair tomorrow,

250
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,510
I'll lure him out

251
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,550
and see if he wants to get rid of me.

252
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,860
Why risk yourself like this?

253
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,260
Find a martial maid
from the Marquis Mansion…

254
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,730
If Wei Yanzhi really is the killer,

255
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,770
he won't take the bait

256
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,770
unless it's real.

257
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,850
Your Highness,

258
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,200
just have someone follow me tomorrow.

259
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,260
I'll take my leave.

260
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,830
Young Master,
here's a letter from the capital.

261
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,280
It says Young Master Qizhi

262
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,490
and his attendant disappeared
the day after we left.

263
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,010
Why didn't you report this sooner?

264
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,190
The guards searched the entire capital

265
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,450
but couldn't find him.

266
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,280
Only then did the Duke send word.

267
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,330
Send men to search along the road we took.

268
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,120
I'm afraid…

269
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,610
my brother is on his way here.

270
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,290
Then…

271
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,250
could it be him who killed…

272
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:51,890
Shut up!

273
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,610
Don't you think
the Duke's already in enough trouble?

274
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,330
But I heard from His Highness's men

275
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,280
that they'll do a third examination.

276
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,920
If they really find something,

277
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
how will we explain that to the Duke?

278
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,970
If the coroner disappears,

279
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,690
the Duke

280
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,020
can rest easy.

281
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,430
[Silence]

282
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,210
Grand Princess,
your condition has stabilized.

283
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,260
You just need medicine and rest now.

284
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,390
I'll come check on you every other day.

285
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,970
Once again,

286
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,060
you saved

287
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,540
my life, Miss Qin.

288
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,780
Miss Qin,

289
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,630
if only you could stay here with Ning.

290
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,400
Yes, Little Wan'er,

291
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,130
please stay.

292
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,090
Thank you for your kindness,

293
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,710
but the Qin Mansion isn't far from here.

294
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,370
It's easy for me to come and go.

295
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,050
Why do you have to go home every night?

296
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,910
Miss Qin hasn't married yet.

297
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,670
If she stays out overnight,

298
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,240
people will gossip.

299
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,770
Chi.

300
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,750
You look troubled.

301
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,090
Is it because the case isn't going well?

302
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,730
No.

303
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,560
Miss Qin has confirmed
the murder happened at Shili Temple.

304
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,930
The escort team
hadn't entered Jingzhou by then.

305
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,390
No one can implicate the Yue family.

306
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,820
So, Jia,

307
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,800
you're cleared of suspicion.

308
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,070
Thank goodness.

309
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,490
Thank goodness.

310
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,570
Wan,

311
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,950
you really are our lucky star.

312
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,660
We don't even know how to thank you.

313
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,660
Since I arrived in Jingzhou,

314
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,550
I haven't gone out to have fun yet.

315
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,850
There's a lantern fair tonight
for the Autumn Festival.

316
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,950
I really want to go.

317
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,540
Grand Princess, could you

318
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,250
talk to my grandma on my behalf?

319
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,490
No problem.

320
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,630
I'll send someone
to inform your grandma right away.

321
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,370
And don't go home tonight.

322
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,780
Let Chi

323
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,860
go with you

324
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,210
and Ning and have some fun.

325
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,730
Yes. I'll make sure Little Wan'er

326
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,970
enjoys herself.

327
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,090
And Vice Commandant Wei.

328
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,040
He's looked gloomy all day.

329
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,820
Maybe he's still worried about the case.

330
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,370
Can I let him join us?

331
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,660
Yeah.

332
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,170
That illegitimate son of the Wei family

333
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,990
unfortunately got dragged into this mess.

334
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,110
Poor guy.

335
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,020
He definitely has no idea
how to face the Song family now.

336
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,780
He really is quite pitiful.

337
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,020
Let him go.

338
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,300
Let him join you.

339
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,750
As you wish, Great Aunt.

340
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,230
I'll go too.

341
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,640
Sure.

342
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,180
You all go play.

343
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,300
My Lady,

344
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,370
look, so many gifts.

345
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,660
Your Ladyship, this is too much.

346
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,570
Mother and Grandma
prepared them for you.

347
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,660
If you don't want them,

348
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
go tell my mother.

349
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,730
Come on, get in the carriage.

350
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,900
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

351
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,600
What's this?

352
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,020
The most popular storybook right now.

353
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,780
Miss Qin will surely like it.

354
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,140
You're giving a storybook
to an unmarried lady?

355
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,940
Aren't you worried
it'll tarnish her reputation?

356
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,660
Even if it's about a heroine
fighting injustice?

357
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,420
If you give her a medical book,

358
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,570
she may like it more.

359
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,600
Go back.

360
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Then you take it.

361
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,180
Chi.

362
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,040
This...

363
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,850
This is for you.

364
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,150
It's a story about heroes.

365
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,070
By the way,

366
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,850
I'll be the one to walk Miss Qin out

367
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,920
from now on.

368
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,490
Why?

369
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,170
Because

370
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
you can't beat me.

371
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,230
I...

372
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,020
I'll beat you someday!

373
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,900
I'll wait.

374
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,380
Let's go!

375
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,860
My bunny.

376
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,670
Look.

377
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,490
So beautiful.

378
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,940
Little Wan'er,

379
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,550
this whole street is packed
with food and games.

380
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,010
Where do you want to start?

381
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,020
Where are my brother and Chi?

382
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,380
I haven't seen them
since we got off the carriage.

383
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,360
Forget about them.

384
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,690
Let's enjoy ourselves.

385
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,950
Your Ladyship, look at that lantern.

386
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,950
So beautiful.

387
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
That little rabbit is so cute.

388
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,910
My Lady, look!

389
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,200
There's a shadow play!

390
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,980
Come on. Let's give it a try.

391
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,720
Hurry up.

392
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,700
You try it too.

393
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,740
No, thanks.

394
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,540
"Seagulls and Egrets in Serenity."

395
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,400
Seagulls what?

396
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,140
It's the name of a zither piece,
"Seagulls and Egrets in Serenity."

397
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,330
In all this noise,

398
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,140
you can still recognize a tune.

399
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,960
You must've been good at the zither
since you were young.

400
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,770
Not at all.

401
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,850
That piece is my older brother's favorite.

402
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,690
I've heard him play it so many times

403
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,890
that it stuck with me.

404
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,060
So your brother studied the zither
from a young age?

405
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,590
He's the Wei family's
eldest legitimate son,

406
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,620
highly valued
by both Mother and the Duke of Song.

407
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,060
The Duke even hired

408
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,020
the best zither teacher in the capital
to teach him and Rou.

409
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,700
If he hadn't broken his leg taming a horse

410
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,050
before the trip,

411
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,540
he would've been the one
escorting the bride.

412
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,160
There are thick calluses
on the second joint

413
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,020
of her left middle finger
and the joint of her thumb.

414
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,920
The Song family's servants said

415
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,250
Miss Song was quite skilled at the zither.

416
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,890
Then why didn't you
learn to play the zither?

417
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,750
Because when my mother was alive,

418
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,070
she didn't want me
to trouble the Duke too often.

419
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,130
Come on,

420
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,850
we're out to have fun.

421
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,730
Let's not talk about sad things.

422
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,270
His Highness will be worried
if he can't find us.

423
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,340
Vice Commandant Wei and I
will go over there.

424
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,470
You two go look for them

425
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,470
and meet us later.

426
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,850
No way.

427
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,540
It's better if Miss Qin

428
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,270
and Your Ladyship stay here for a bit.

429
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,930
I'll go look for His Highness.

430
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,780
It's just that

431
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,040
I want to find that zither player first,

432
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,650
so I'm afraid you'll have to

433
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,850
wait a little longer.

434
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,570
Go on, go.

435
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,780
Just don't get lost.

436
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,260
Anyone who doesn't know
he's an illegitimate son

437
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,110
would take him

438
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,020
for some young master

439
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,820
from a prestigious family.

440
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,590
Let's go.

441
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,220
Lanterns.

442
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,810
Beautiful lanterns.

443
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,260
Lanterns.

444
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,600
Fuling,

445
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,080
go lead Her Ladyship away.

446
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,650
No,

447
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,250
I need to stay and protect you.

448
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,680
I talked with His Highness.

449
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,250
He'll be watching over me in secret.

450
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,580
You don't have to worry.

451
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,180
Go.

452
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,780
I like this one.

453
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,370
Your Ladyship, look.

454
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,780
That butterfly is so beautiful.

455
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,820
Let's go to the second floor.

456
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,020
Sure. Little Wan'er.

457
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,460
Where is she?

458
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,890
She went to find His Highness.

459
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,650
Don't worry.

460
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,910
But...

461
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,260
Come on, let's go.

462
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,000
Sir, this float is so fun!

463
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,900
Get on it.

464
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,700
Goodbye, sir. Goodbye.

465
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,500
Miss Qin.

466
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,930
She's so beautiful.

467
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,020
She really is.

468
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,610
The Shuoxi Army guards the borders,

469
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,020
fighting by day
and sleeping in cold mountains by night,

470
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,410
so that the cities can be brightly lit

471
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,260
every night

472
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,330
and the people can live in peace.

473
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,260
Miss, you're so beautiful.

474
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,290
I'm not as noble as you, Chi.

475
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,800
I just want the one I love

476
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,220
to stay safe.

477
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,850
Only when our country is prosperous

478
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,410
can the people be safe and thriving.

479
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,090
Right?

480
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,310
Miss…

481
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,980
Sorry.

482
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,830
Who are you looking for?

483
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,130
Sorry.

484
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,500
I mistook you for someone else.

485
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,700
Who is he looking for?

486
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,460
All kinds of masks!

487
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,020
Come and take a look.

488
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,540
Wei Yanzhi.

489
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,980
Is that you?

490
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,930
Miss,

491
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,840
do you want a mask?

492
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,610
We've got everything.

493
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,540
Take a look.

494
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,400
I want this one.

495
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,130
Okay.

496
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,570
Come on.

497
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,510
Come and take a look.

498
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,850
Lantern riddles!

499
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,350
Come and try your luck.

500
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,650
If you get them all right,

501
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,020
you'll win a special prize

502
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,460
prepared by our shop!

503
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,500
Come and give it a shot!

504
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,020
Take a look.

505
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,260
Lantern riddles!

506
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,280
Hurry up.

507
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,260
Are you alright?

508
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,330
I'm fine.

509
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,780
Why are you here?

510
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,990
I saw Wei Yanzhi
getting off the lantern float,

511
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,990
so I followed him.

512
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,260
I was afraid he'd see me,

513
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,300
so I bought a mask.

514
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
But then I realized

515
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,700
it wasn't Wei Yanzhi.

516
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
It wasn't.

517
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,740
He's still there listening to music.

518
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,880
It was bold of you to take a risk

519
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,170
on such a crowded street.

520
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:48,650
Luckily,

521
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,980
someone mentioned a girl in a xiezhi mask.

522
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,320
That's how I found you.

523
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,010
How did you know
I was the one in the xiezhi mask?

524
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,820
The xiezhi can tell right from wrong.

525
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,020
In this world,

526
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,090
what other girl

527
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,370
would wear such a fierce-looking mask?

528
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,320
You're hurt?

529
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,370
It's nothing.

530
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,320
Don't tell anyone.

531
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:16,930
Let's go.

532
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,860
How did you get hurt so badly?

533
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,460
It's inevitable when you fight in battles.

534
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,410
But this blade wound

535
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,480
is clearly recent.

536
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,480
But there's no battlefield

537
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,470
between the capital and Jingzhou.

538
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,080
This is why they say
smart women are dangerous.

539
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,460
I think only inept people believe that.

540
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,250
I didn't expect Your Highness
to be one of them.

541
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,780
I'm just afraid that knowing too much

542
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,040
may get you in trouble.

543
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,370
However,

544
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,010
if you want to know,

545
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,720
I can tell you.

546
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,500
I don't want to uncover military secrets.

547
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,360
What if it's not a military secret

548
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,740
but a wrongful conviction in the capital?

549
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,030
You still don't need to tell me.

550
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,020
If that wound had gone

551
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,330
half an inch deeper,
you'd have become a cripple.

552
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,310
Why didn't you

553
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,230
say anything or get treatment?

554
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,990
The wound is already infected.

555
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,280
I have medicine with me.

556
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,480
I can treat it myself.

557
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,120
Have some numbing decoction.

558
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,060
No need.

559
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,710
I can take it.

560
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,360
That wound goes across your spine.

561
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,300
I need to remove
the infected tissue before stitching.

562
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,500
If you move even slightly,
the nerves could be damaged.

563
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,300
By then, it'll be beyond fixing.

564
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,830
I joined the army when I was 10.

565
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,130
I've gotten through worse without help.

566
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,390
Using things like that

567
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,770
only makes a man soft.

568
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,370
Fine.

569
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,020
If it becomes too much, tell me.

570
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,710
Don't worry.

571
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,330
Miss Qin,

572
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,660
please make me a wound medicine

573
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,430
for battlefield emergencies.

574
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,500
I want it to work fast.

575
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,610
Anything that works fast is fierce.

576
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Most people wouldn't be able to handle it.

577
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,590
The Shuoxi Army is known for being fierce.

578
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,780
A fierce medicine suits us just fine.

579
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,220
All done.

580
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Master, I have something to report.

581
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,750
Come in.

582
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,020
Master,

583
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,050
someone deliberately cut off

584
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,080
the beam at the base of the lantern tower.

585
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,610
But it wasn't Wei Yanzhi
who lured Miss Qin out.

586
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,660
At the time of the incident,

587
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,260
he was at Tianyin Pavilion
listening to music.

588
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,090
The musician and the shopkeeper
both confirmed it.

589
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,190
The Song family has 20 martial guards.

590
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,350
They're all at the Song Mansion now.

591
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,080
But

592
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,920
they went
to the lantern fair together earlier.

593
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,810
It's a small guard team,

594
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,540
but they're more disciplined
than actual soldiers.

595
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,570
Even when they're off duty,
they stick together.

596
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,630
That's not common.

597
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,650
I'll go deal with them right away.

598
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,460
-Stop.
-Stop.

599
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,220
You can't act without just cause.

600
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,590
They did all this

601
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,410
to stop me from performing the autopsy.

602
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,650
The sooner we get it done,

603
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,850
the less chance they have to interfere.

604
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,930
Bai Feng,

605
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,330
tomorrow you're allowed
to spar with the Song family's guards.

606
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,460
Make it a narrow win.

607
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,150
Don't end it too quickly.

608
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,670
Keep it going until Huo Huaixin steps in.

609
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:08,820
Yes.

610
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,980
Miss Qin,

611
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,540
please conduct the autopsy tomorrow.

612
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,130
Okay.

613
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,430
[Fair and Just]

614
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,740
General Bai,

615
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,430
you said you fought
with the Song family's guards

616
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,700
because they slandered His Highness.

617
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,260
What exactly did they say?

618
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,450
They said His Highness
is highly skilled in martial arts

619
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,540
and arrived in Jingzhou just after them.

620
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,670
They claimed he used

621
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:01,780
the investigation

622
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,130
as a pretext to sexually assault Miss Song

623
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,790
and killed her when it failed.

624
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,610
Nonsense!

625
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,300
Your Highness,

626
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,820
I swear on my life,

627
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,190
no one in the Song Mansion

628
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,100
would dare harbor

629
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,700
such an outrageous thought.

630
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,740
Prefect Huo.

631
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,060
Rumors may die in the minds of the wise,

632
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,060
but there's no smoke without fire.

633
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,280
If word like that gets out,

634
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,500
how can I still call myself

635
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,950
the Young Marshal of the Shuoxi Army?

636
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,160
I'll issue an immediate gag order.

637
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,150
I…

638
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,780
I'm ashamed.

639
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,420
Since someone's stirring the pot,

640
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,800
there's no need for me to hold back.

641
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Miss Song's autopsy
must be done immediately.

642
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,500
If we can't find the real killer
and clear my name,

643
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,290
the two of you

644
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,820
can take a trip with me to Shuoxi.

645
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,810
Calm down, Your Highness.

646
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,880
I'll arrange the autopsy right away.

647
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,080
[Grace and Purity]

648
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,540
My Lady, is something on your mind?

649
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,470
You've been zoning out for a while.

650
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,070
There's something I can't figure out.

651
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,470
Why would Lord Yan
willingly tarnish his own name

652
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,200
to help me conduct the autopsy?

653
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,540
This case has nothing to do
with the Yue family,

654
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,400
and it's not his responsibility.

655
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,750
He has no personal grudge
against the Song family either.

656
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,740
My Lady,

657
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,540
how do you think His Highness treats you?

658
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,130
Very well.

659
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,650
Then why do you think

660
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,700
His Highness treats you differently

661
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,430
from everyone else?

662
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,600
He said

663
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,420
I saved the Grand Princess,

664
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,680
so he's indebted to me.

665
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,310
And that only I can help him
do what he wants to do.

666
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,370
Maybe he values my forensic skills

667
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,520
and wants my help.

668
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,890
My Lady, have you never considered that

669
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,960
maybe His Highness…

670
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,660
has feelings for you?

671
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,680
My identity is fake,

672
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,120
but it's true that I'm using him.

673
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,670
I need his power

674
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,500
to escape the Qin family.

675
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,980
I can't afford to let my guard down.

676
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,340
If I can't be honest with him,

677
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,830
how could I possibly return his feelings?

678
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,350
But…

679
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,900
but can't he be carrying a torch for you?

680
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,540
He…

681
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,150
he doesn't seem like that kind of man.

682
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,100
Fire! Hurry!

683
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Get more water!

684
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,170
Quick!

685
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,890
We need more hands!

686
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Get more water.

687
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,520
[Qin Mansion]

688
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,370
Miss Qin,

689
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,580
the morgue caught fire last night.

690
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,830
The east wing was burned down.

691
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,889
I'm afraid the body

692
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,710
can't be examined anymore.

693
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,050
Does His Highness know?

694
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,219
As soon as Master heard,
he rushed to the morgue overnight.

695
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,449
He asked me to wait here for you

696
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,050
so you wouldn't waste a trip.

697
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,530
Then why is the Yue family's carriage
still here?

698
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,170
Master thought

699
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,159
you might insist on going.

700
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,810
Get in. Let's go to the morgue.

701
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,889
Miss Qin,

702
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,370
the body's been burned beyond recognition.

703
00:34:57,739 --> 00:34:58,929
Can it still be examined?

704
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,460
Whether it can be examined
is for me to decide.

705
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,470
My forensic box!

706
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,920
That's a forensic box!

707
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,820
There's no money inside. Stop!

708
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,370
I knew you'd come.

709
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,340
The paper offerings and candles
in the morgue catch fire easily,

710
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,150
but there were plenty of ice basins here.

711
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,410
As the ice melted into water,

712
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,050
it should've dampened the fire.

713
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,410
There's no way this whole place
could've burned down.

714
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,410
Where's the body?

715
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,340
In the main hall.

716
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,550
But first, come take a look at this.

717
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,410
What's that smell?

718
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,100
Tung oil.

719
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,490
The morgue usually uses butter lamps.

720
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,260
Someone set this fire on purpose.

721
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,410
Huo Huaixin has sent men to check

722
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,090
who bought tung oil last night.

723
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,050
If I guess right…

724
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,980
It's someone from the Song family.

725
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,300
[Fortune Inn]

726
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,580
Young Master Qizhi.

727
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,390
[Wei Qizhi]

728
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,490
You got it?

729
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,160
Yes.

730
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,750
Can you still examine it?

731
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,740
The body's surface is completely charred,

732
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,250
with no skin texture visible.

733
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,740
But an autopsy focuses
on the internal organs.

734
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,340
I look for signs in the body.

735
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,370
So yes, it can still be examined.

736
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,700
But Xu He isn't here yet,

737
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,200
and the tools are with him.

738
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,230
Bai Feng!

739
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,330
This is...

740
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,260
I prepared this ahead of time.

741
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,010
It's inappropriate as a gift for a girl,

742
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,660
so I kept it at the morgue,

743
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,390
just in case you'd ever need it.

744
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,220
Bring it in.

745
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

746
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,030
If you want to thank me,
do a proper examination.

747
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,960
I'll write the postmortem report.

748
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,590
Write this down.

749
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,660
Due to extensive burns on the body,

750
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,720
the third examination is an autopsy.

751
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,330
The victim has been dead
for nearly nine days.

752
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,190
So only a small amount
of stomach contents remains.

753
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,980
What's wrong?

754
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,340
Write this down.

755
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,010
The pelvis is wide

756
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,940
and tilted backward.

757
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,220
The pubic bone is broader than average.

758
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,230
The uterus sits lower than normal.

759
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,830
What does that mean?

760
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,890
It suggests the deceased

761
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,220
had once been pregnant.

762
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,630
Could you be mistaken?

763
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,330
Based on the width

764
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,300
and backward tilt of the pelvis,

765
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,620
she was likely

766
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,290
about five to six months along.

767
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,490
Her uterus had returned
to normal size,

768
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,380
which means the miscarriage
happened about two months ago.

769
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,050
When she left for Jingzhou,

770
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,490
she must've just recovered.

771
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,660
Then how could the Song family

772
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,220
still have sent her off
to be married after that?

773
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,950
That's deceiving His Majesty!

774
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,060
If the Duke of Song dared do that,

775
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,980
he must've had a foolproof plan.

776
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,570
Your Highness.

777
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,180
This is a sketch from the oil shop owner

778
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,450
of the man who bought tung oil yesterday.

779
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,180
Isn't this Wei Cheng,
the Song Mansion's guard captain?

780
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,410
There's no way a lowly guard captain

781
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,410
would've dared destroy the corpse.

782
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,410
I'm afraid Wei Yanzhi ordered it.

783
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,610
He owes everything to the Duke of Song.

784
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,890
Of course he'd do everything
he could to help the Duke out.

785
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,890
Wei Yanzhi said

786
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,160
his older brother
and Miss Song grew up together.

787
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,620
If not for the broken leg,

788
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,100
he would've been the one
escorting the bride.

789
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,890
Could his brother be

790
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,300
the one Song Rou had an affair…

791
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,780
with?

792
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,210
That's a matter of the inner chambers.

793
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,280
The Duke must've
picked someone loyal and discreet

794
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,430
to guide Song Rou

795
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,520
and ensure everything went smoothly

796
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,580
on the wedding day.

797
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,600
The female servant in charge of her dowry

798
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,640
was likely placed there by the Duke.

799
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,110
Right. I'll have someone
question her right away.
