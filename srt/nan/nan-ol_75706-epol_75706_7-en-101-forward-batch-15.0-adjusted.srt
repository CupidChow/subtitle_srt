[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,940
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,960
I was so immature before.

4
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,140
Big Brother, thanks to

5
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,310
your guidance yesterday,

6
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,759
I've got it all straight now.

7
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,620
"Big Brother"?

8
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,680
I've heard everything.

9
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,920
That day when Huo Du held me hostage,

10
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,690
it was you who risked your life

11
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,570
to save me.

12
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,750
Big Brother, your kindness

13
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,870
saved both my life and soul.

14
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,870
I'm here today

15
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,840
in the hope of becoming

16
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,590
sworn brothers with you.

17
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,610
I appreciate it.

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,100
But there's no need to.

19
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,410
Ever since I was little,

20
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,430
despite how my father and sister

21
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,750
cared about me,

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,329
they've never really talked to me kindly.

23
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,470
They always speak harshly,

24
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,960
making the home feel unwelcoming.

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,880
But after our conversation yesterday,

26
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,800
I finally felt a bit of warmth.

27
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,310
You and Li Shuang

28
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,470
are siblings.

29
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,590
If we become sworn brothers,

30
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,890
then she and I...

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,360
What does our brotherhood
have to do with her?

32
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,000
Besides, I'm absolutely honest

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,630
with my brothers.

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
If you're interested in my sister,

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,120
feel free to ask me anything.

36
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,590
Come on, brother.

37
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,840
Heaven above and Earth below,

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
please be our witnesses.

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,150
Today,

40
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,310
I, Li Ting,

41
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,530
and Jin'an

42
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,520
solemnly swear brotherhood.

43
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,590
From now on, we'll

44
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,680
respect and care for each other,

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,810
never parting ways.

46
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,470
Big Brother,

47
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,570
let me drink to you.

48
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,360
From today on,

49
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,690
I can finally say I have a family.

50
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,870
By the way,

51
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,940
I want to ask about your sister...

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,940
Fairy Physician's medicine

53
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,399
is incredibly effective.

54
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,320
You're really something.

55
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,770
This medicine is very potent,

56
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,670
yet you've come around so fast.

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,740
Where are we going?

58
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,200
We're heading back to the capital.

59
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,650
You went through all this trouble

60
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,650
just to take me back to the capital?

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,250
Although you saved my life,

62
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,770
you're still the murderer
who killed Huo Du.

63
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,720
I don't know why Shuang

64
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,580
is being so indecisive this time.

65
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,510
But I know

66
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,390
only by handing you over to the court

67
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,750
can we quell
His Majesty's suspicions of the Li family

68
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,150
and the Changfeng Army.

69
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,470
Some matters take priority.

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,690
Big Brother, I'll repay

71
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,840
your favor in the next life.

72
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,790
You've seen it clearly?

73
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,159
That shadow puppet

74
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:02,480
was indeed in a coma.

75
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,440
That young man from the Li family

76
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,150
smuggled him
out of the General's Residence.

77
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,070
The two of them

78
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,020
are now on their way to the capital.

79
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,510
Master,

80
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,159
you once said

81
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,530
that shadow puppets
should be immune to all poisons.

82
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,650
According to this,

83
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,020
no knockout drug is supposed
to work on him.

84
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,680
But given today's situation,

85
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,070
something's fishy about it.

86
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,360
Seems like

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
Jade Linglong hasn't smoothly integrated

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,870
into the shadow puppet's body,

89
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,160
making his power

90
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,680
unstable and beyond his control.

91
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,310
Moreover,

92
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,070
in the stone chamber and secret forest,

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,870
he recklessly used his power,

94
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,800
causing severe damage.

95
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,430
If he hasn't been nourished

96
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,430
by the blood master's blood in time,

97
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,750
then he should be

98
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,270
at his weakest right now.

99
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,830
In this case,

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,330
isn't it like
luck is on your side, Master?

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,310
I'm serious.

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,630
The trap was real,

103
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,370
but so was our sworn brotherhood.

104
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,190
As those six incense sticks burned out,

105
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,050
our oath has reached the heavens.

106
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,980
This time, I betrayed your trust.

107
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,880
Whatever the consequences,

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,830
I'm willing to bear them alone.

109
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,030
If you really see me as your Big Brother,

110
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,240
then please hear me out.

111
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,390
I never intended to shirk responsibility

112
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,120
for what happened to Huo Du.

113
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,970
Right now,
I can't leave your sister at will,

114
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,680
or my life would be in danger.

115
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,390
If I die on the way,

116
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,290
your Li family would only face

117
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,390
more accusations with no way
to defend yourselves.

118
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,270
Nonsense!

119
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,430
What do you mean you can't leave her?

120
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,800
Even though you're my Big Brother,

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,460
I can't let you
tarnish my sister's reputation.

122
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,390
If you're going to act,
at least make it convincing.

123
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,050
Who are you?

124
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,170
How dare you block
the Li family's carriage?

125
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,100
A silver needle?

126
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,280
You're the ones who stirred up trouble
in the military camp!

127
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,790
As expected of a shadow puppet.

128
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,450
You're really quick-witted.

129
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,360
Leave now.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,950
If you die,

131
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,710
the Li family is done for.

132
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,590
Last time, I failed to transform

133
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,790
and lost all my power.

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,190
But that day,
under the flowering tree with Li Shuang,

135
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,320
my wounds miraculously healed again.

136
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,289
Now with life hanging by a thread,

137
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,250
no matter what,

138
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:50,750
I have to try.

139
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,880
No matter what happens later,

140
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,789
I won't hurt you.

141
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,650
Don't tell your sister

142
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,680
about what happened today.

143
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,840
A-Are you

144
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,140
a demon or a god?

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,750
Don't be afraid.

146
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,010
Why should I be afraid?

147
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,600
I can't admire you more.

148
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,260
Had I known you were this powerful,

149
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,600
I wouldn't just call you Big Brother.

150
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,000
I'd worship you as my god.

151
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,970
G-Give me a punch.

152
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,550
Transformation is something

153
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,080
that comes from within.

154
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,560
It's still treacherous here.

155
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,670
Let's return
to the General's Residence first.

156
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay.

157
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,030
Let's go.

158
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,630
How did you get changed just now?

159
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,430
Want to learn?

160
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
Both of them are missing?

161
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,900
Have you searched carefully?

162
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,050
We've searched everywhere.

163
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,270
But they're still nowhere to be found.

164
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,150
He must have been

165
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,910
taken away by the Young Master.

166
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,320
It was my negligence.

167
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,160
Please punish me, General.

168
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,440
Both of them?

169
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,550
Both of them.

170
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,510
Could it be...

171
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,080
Bring our men

172
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,840
and go after them with me!

173
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,640
Don't bother.

174
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,270
I've already brought him back.

175
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
He's in the side room.

176
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,320
Sorry, I was wrong.

177
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
We have failed your trust, Master.

178
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,910
We're willing to accept harsh punishment.

179
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,310
We're willing to accept harsh punishment.

180
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,560
Master.

181
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,910
Jade Linglong entered
his body by accident.

182
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,120
He's not a perfect shadow puppet.

183
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,980
Yet he can control such formidable power.

184
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,800
It must be his growing intimacy
with the blood master

185
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,140
that has allowed Jade Linglong

186
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,070
to merge with him even better.

187
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,620
Seems like it's not a good idea

188
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,840
to seize it by force.

189
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,460
You took Jin'an away without permission

190
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,800
to hand him over to the court

191
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,270
and save our father.

192
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,240
But Jin'an saved your life.

193
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,570
If something happened to him,

194
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,320
you'd bear all consequences

195
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,630
by yourself,

196
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,680
even at the cost of your life,

197
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,940
right?

198
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,170
How could you put yourself in danger
with no regard for your own safety?

199
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,950
It was dangerous, and that was exactly why

200
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,070
I must do it.

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,580
Father is imprisoned,

202
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,870
and you, Shuang, are constantly on alert,

203
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,010
unable to rest well at night.

204
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,320
As Young Master Li,

205
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,320
how could I stand by and do nothing?

206
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,970
I just wanted to do something for you all.

207
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,680
I'm just glad to see you back
safe and sound.

208
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,200
Shuang,

209
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,720
aren't you going to scold me?

210
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,440
Ting.

211
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,890
You've grown up.

212
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm very happy about that.

213
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,720
But some things

214
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,860
aren't as simple as you think.

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,200
Now His Majesty

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,330
is wary of our Li family.

217
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Our future is dim.

218
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,430
It's not something you can solve
by mere audacity.

219
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,120
Besides,

220
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,100
Father sent you to Lucheng

221
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,550
so that I could protect you.

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,930
If something were to happen to you,

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,240
I would fail Father's entrustment.

224
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,840
Since I was little,

225
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,450
no matter what happened in our family,

226
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,480
you and Father
have always kept it secret from me.

227
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,790
I understand

228
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,550
that you both want to protect me.

229
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,530
But I'm also a member
of the honorable Li family.

230
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,390
I don't want to be a useless loser,

231
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,800
living under the protection

232
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,910
of you and Father throughout my life.

233
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,960
Ting.

234
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,170
In my heart,

235
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,960
you've always been that little boy

236
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,470
following me

237
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,760
and asking for candy.

238
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,390
I forgot

239
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,270
that you've grown up

240
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,240
into a real man.

241
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
That's my fault.

242
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,550
I know

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm still not full-fledged yet.

244
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,870
But someday,

245
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,750
I'll be as strong

246
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,020
and capable as you,

247
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,410
protecting our state and people.

248
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,210
When that day comes,

249
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,150
Shuang, you can live

250
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,000
for yourself

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,110
the way you like it.

252
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,510
Okay.

253
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,080
Good!

254
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,480
Stop crying.

255
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,360
Stop.

256
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,540
Do your knees hurt?

257
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,120
Nope.

258
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:24,960
Really?

259
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,750
Then give me a smile if it doesn't hurt.

260
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,320
Why should I?

261
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,790
Just give me a smile. Come on.

262
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,480
Who cries and smiles at the same time?

263
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,870
So I'm your big sister.

264
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,040
I said, smile.

265
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,630
You're annoying.

266
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,150
-Give me a smile!
-Don't touch me.

267
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,670
I'm leaving!

268
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,720
Stop there!

269
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,890
Leave me alone!

270
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,240
Stop chasing me!

271
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,870
I said, stop!

272
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,510
No!

273
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,630
I won't stop!

274
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,510
Stop there!

275
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,150
Li Ting!

276
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,870
That's enough.

277
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,000
Just smile.

278
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,870
So annoying.

279
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,550
Is it so hard to smile?

280
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,640
Li Ting?

281
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,710
Given Ting's stubborn character,

282
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,510
he wouldn't change his mind easily.

283
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Did you persuade him?

284
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,080
He's not as unreasonable

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,080
as you think.

286
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,150
He acted on impulse today

287
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,550
and offended you.

288
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,610
I hope you can forgive him.

289
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,910
Also,

290
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,160
you were right.

291
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,800
Some things, if not said,

292
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,240
will never be heard.

293
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Thank you.

294
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,010
Esteemed Immortal,

295
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,800
please forgive us
for not greeting you sooner.

296
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,150
I'm just a medicine deliverer,

297
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,210
not some immortal.

298
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,830
Thank you
for the medicine from Wuling Mountain.

299
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,980
Immortal,

300
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,720
are there
any special instructions this time?

301
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,120
Just take it. That's all.

302
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,160
Your Highness,

303
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,400
everything has been arranged.

304
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,950
Please rest assured.

305
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,810
Were it not for Father's obsession
with immortality

306
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,870
and his desperate search for elixir,

307
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,620
we wouldn't have gotten this opportunity.

308
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,690
After taking the medicine, His Majesty

309
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,770
appears more energetic,

310
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,640
but his health deteriorates day by day.

311
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,830
The imperial physicians

312
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,760
would never figure out the reason.

313
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,080
Control the dosage carefully.

314
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,920
I need my dear younger brother

315
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,670
to die before Father does.

316
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,000
[The Imperial Palace of Taijin]

317
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,070
By order of His Majesty,

318
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,650
[Xianyang Palace]

319
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,310
the court is dismissed today.

320
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,750
Your Excellencies,

321
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,200
you may leave.

322
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,790
I've heard

323
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,310
about the Crown Prince
attending to Father frequently

324
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,570
with great diligence.

325
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,270
No wonder Father
has started seeking your counsel.

326
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,030
You're quite the actor,

327
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,000
good at winning people over.

328
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,690
Brother, you've got me wrong.

329
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
I know

330
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,720
I cannot ease Father's burdens,

331
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,590
so all I can do is

332
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,760
attend to him by his side

333
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,040
to show my care.

334
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,160
Is that so?

335
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Then why did you use
your audience with Father

336
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,590
to constantly speak up

337
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,030
for the Li family?

338
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,720
Brother,

339
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,000
your concern for the state

340
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,960
and fear of the Li family's military power
overshadowing the throne

341
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,270
are understandable.

342
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,790
But you shouldn't

343
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,810
fixate on persecuting the Li family

344
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,140
and constantly make things hard for them.

345
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The entire Li family

346
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,330
is devoted to our state.

347
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,070
Your actions

348
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,470
will only discourage

349
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,640
the loyalty of our subjects.

350
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
Just because you're the Crown Prince

351
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,440
doesn't mean you can ascend the throne.

352
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,990
You're a cripple.

353
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,770
Let me see how long your glory can last.

354
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,320
[Crown Prince's Mansion, Lucheng, Taijin]

355
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,190
[General's Residence]

356
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,300
What are you doing?

357
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,250
That's the third plate?

358
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,200
It's all your fault!

359
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,240
You must make it up to me!

360
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,110
Make up for my pastries!

361
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,790
If you want pastries,
have someone else make them.

362
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,250
Why go to all this trouble?

363
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,940
Why did you put
so much charcoal in the pot?

364
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,110
Stop talking nonsense.

365
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,510
You know nothing.

366
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
These are
Shuang's favorite pear-blossom pastries.

367
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,020
Your sister likes these?

368
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,550
I've caused Shuang a lot of trouble.

369
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
Before I leave,

370
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,430
I should do something for her

371
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,200
to make amends.

372
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,550
Leave?

373
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,630
Yes,

374
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,920
I'm leaving.

375
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
As the Young Master of the Li family,

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,200
how can I stand aside at a time like this?

377
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,790
Even if I can't do much,

378
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,550
I should stay by my father's side

379
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,880
through thick and thin.

380
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,770
I'm sorry for what I did

381
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,750
to you.

382
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,750
I once thought

383
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,720
that for the greater good,

384
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,200
I could disregard everything else.

385
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,400
But how can it be called the greater good

386
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,530
if it means
sacrificing the lives of others?

387
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,050
You've saved me twice.

388
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,040
I'll definitely

389
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,470
repay your favor one day.

390
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,720
Okay.

391
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,920
I'll wait for that day to come.

392
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,840
But before that, you should

393
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,200
promise me something.

394
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Haven't you got this backwards?

395
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,160
Aren't you supposed to repay me?

396
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,920
I don't care.

397
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,070
You boast exceptional martial skills
and supernatural strength.

398
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,350
If Shuang ever encounters any danger,

399
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,440
you must do everything in your power
to protect her

400
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,270
and make sure she doesn't get hurt.

401
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,200
Otherwise,

402
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,140
I'll widely

403
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,170
spread the word about your secrets!

404
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,680
Your sister is a general after all.

405
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
She can take care of herself.

406
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,340
Father has always been stern.

407
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,640
Since childhood,

408
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,000
be it studying or training,

409
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,200
she's never been allowed
to slack off for a bit.

410
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,350
Shuang never had the chance

411
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,830
to be pampered or spoiled

412
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,290
like other young ladies.

413
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,480
She was taught from childhood

414
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,440
to spare no effort to protect

415
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
everyone and everything around her.

416
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,030
But no one has ever told her

417
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,750
that she could also be protected.

418
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,160
Shuang

419
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,070
once had a chance

420
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,960
to be cared for by someone.

421
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,270
Unfortunately,

422
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,720
fate played a cruel trick,

423
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,980
and she and Muyang ended up splitting up.

424
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,110
Muyang?

425
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,970
The Crown Prince,

426
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,920
Su Muyang.

427
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,750
He and Shuang grew up together

428
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,720
as childhood sweethearts

429
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,830
with unwavering feelings

430
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,640
deeper than any ordinary ones.

431
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,790
Then why didn't he

432
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,770
come to your sister in person?

433
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,000
He

434
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,790
certainly has his reasons.

435
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,590
Anyway,
Muyang treats my sister really well.

436
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,460
They've been apart for three years,

437
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,130
but he misses her every day.

438
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,950
If so,

439
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,040
why did they split up?

440
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,060
He obeyed His Majesty's order

441
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,750
and married someone else.

442
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,270
But

443
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,480
Muyang also had no choice.

444
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,590
Besides,

445
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,010
knowing my sister's love for biographies,
he's sent people

446
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,740
to search for them everywhere.

447
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,100
Why are you laughing?

448
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,470
It should be a piece of cake

449
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,720
for him, the Crown Prince,

450
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,520
to get some biographies, right?

451
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,750
Also, forget about

452
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,920
his talk of missing her.

453
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,000
Everyone can say

454
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,550
such sweet words.

455
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,830
In my opinion,

456
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,480
truly caring for someone

457
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,210
is more like what you're doing.

458
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,120
Despite your incompetence,

459
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,590
you're showing genuine care.

460
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,200
We're willing to give our all

461
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,460
for those we hold dear.

462
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,980
Even if I'm genuinely caring for her,

463
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,610
what's the point if I can't do it well?

464
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,350
Whether it works or not

465
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,480
is beside the point.

466
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,850
The sun is about to set.

467
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,790
If you still can't pull it off,

468
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,950
Shuang might lose her appetite.

469
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,880
Are you going to help me?

470
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,350
Didn't you ask me to make up
for your pastries?

471
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,000
Besides,

472
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,440
you can consider this

473
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,500
the condition for keeping my secret.

474
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,510
What brings you here?

475
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,240
Li Ting sent me over.

476
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,830
He also had me bring you

477
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,030
your favorite pear-blossom pastries.

478
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,000
Where is he?

479
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,880
He got shy,

480
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,140
saying it was too mushy

481
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,970
and too embarrassing to come.

482
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,960
Did he make these?

483
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
Of course
they didn't look like this at first.

484
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,110
I followed his recipe

485
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,750
and made some adjustments.

486
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,030
Try them and see

487
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,090
if they taste good.

488
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,250
Also, here are

489
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,160
some biographies
Li Ting asked me to give you.

490
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,880
He said

491
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,400
Muyang

492
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
entrusted him to pass them on to you.

493
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,400
Li Ting really has a big mouth,

494
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,130
spilling everything he knows.

495
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,750
Since you two share such a deep bond,

496
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
then

497
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,080
why didn't you stick it out till the end?

498
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,790
Perhaps

499
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,850
you would've ended up a loving couple.

500
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,650
Life rarely offers perfect endings.

501
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,070
I was an orphan.

502
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,640
My father brought me
back to the General's Residence.

503
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,970
Only then did I get
a new identity and name.

504
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,550
Besides,

505
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,880
a war is about ot break out
between Taijin and Yao State.

506
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,080
I have no mind to think of anything else.

507
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,750
You once said

508
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,530
you couldn't leave me.

509
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,070
If you truly want to stay,

510
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,150
you have no choice
but to get dragged into this mess.

511
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,950
The battlefield shows no mercy.

512
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,770
Are you sure about this?

513
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,520
You're willing to keep me here?

514
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,080
Since I can't leave you,

515
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,800
actually,

516
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,760
I've long been ready for this.

517

No matter what happens,

518
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,070
I swear I will protect you.

519
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,640
I think

520
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,230
you remind me of someone.

521
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,550
Get some rest early.

[Xianyang Palace]

523
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,920
Father,

524
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the case of Huo Du

525
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,310
has been open for over a month.

526
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,110
But Li Shuang

527
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,270
still hasn't turned in the person

528
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,270
who killed Huo Du.

529
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,350
I'm afraid

530
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,070
there's more behind it.

531
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,680
Prince Li, please speak with caution!

532
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,480
Your Majesty,

533
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,720
Li Shuang's thoroughly investigated
Huo Du's remaining accomplices.

534
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,030
Huo Du secretly colluded with Yao State.

535
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,270
There's solid evidence for it.

536
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,750
And Li Shuang already used fake maps

537
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,400
to lure the enemy
deep into the trap at the border

538
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,590
and defeated the Yao Army.

539
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,050
But Father, the matter of accomplices
cannot be proven as the suspects are dead.

540
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Your Majesty,

541
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,200
the Li family
has guarded the border for years

542
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,060
and would never dare deceive you.

543
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,650
Father, I'd like to report to you

544
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,680
the recent memorials

545
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
from numerous imperial censors,

546
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,020
all impeaching Li Shuang for deceiving

547
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,870
the court, colluding with Yao State,
and framing loyal officials,

548
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,550
with the intention

549
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,440
of exonerating her father, Li Wei.

550
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,550
I believe

551
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,030
it's imperative and urgent to send
Imperial Censor Li Zhangyi to Lucheng

552
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,430
as a Military Supervisor

553
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,920
to conduct a thorough investigation.

554
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,350
By my decree,

555
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,880
Li Zhangyi shall

556
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,310
head for the border immediately

557
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,400
and take over as Military Supervisor
of the Changfeng Army.

558
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

559
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,210
Father, you are so wise.

[General's Residence]

Tell him not to worry.

So don't worry, Shuang.

But you're

far away at the border,

always sharing good news, never the bad.

571

Remember,

will you feel more at ease, Shuang?

577

You're not a burden.

578
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,110
You're my weakness.

579
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,980

Be careful on your way!

594
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,540
"Big Brother"?

595

When did you two become so close?

Before he headed
back to the capital last time,

597

He was the first friend

599

I made after losing my memory.

600
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,660
I'll remember him forever.

601
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,160
Why are you laughing?

602
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
I'm laughing because you don't know

603
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,480
how long "forever" actually is.

604
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,590
Indeed.

605
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,810
Perhaps in the past, I also thought

606
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,990
there would be many things

607
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,720
I'd remember forever and ever.

608
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,320
General,

609
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,310
I've finished investigating.

610
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,350
The Ninglan Commercial Guild Master

611
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,160
is called Zang Budu.

612
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,070
Zang Budu

613
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,640
has dominated this area for years

614
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,720
with a very high reputation,

615
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,270
but...

616
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,400
But in recent years,

617
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,640
Ninglan

618
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,550
has been caught between the two states,

619
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,810
forming its own force.

620
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,890
He must be difficult to deal with.

621
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,690
The Yao Army is on the move now.

622
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,920
The area around Lucheng is easy to defend
but hard to attack.

623
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,180
To gain the upper hand,

624
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,510
Ninglan

625
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
is the key.

626
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,110
General, do you intend

627
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,440
to get the map of Ninglan

628
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,680
from Zang Budu?

629
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,750
In this case,

630
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,310
we should bring more troops

631
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,970
to prepare for any accidents.

632
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,550
If we have spies,

633
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,550
the Yao Army can have theirs too.

634
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,770
This time when we go,

635
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,250
we must keep a low profile.

636
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,350
You're right, General.

637
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,920
Then I'll go pack my things

638
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,440
to go with you, General.

639
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,650
No need for that.

640
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,070
I have

641
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,570
other plans this time.

642
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,580
Go prepare something for me.

643
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,350
You're taking me to Ninglan?

644
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,720
Ninglan

645
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,680
is located at the junction
of Taijin and Yao State.

646
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,080
Though it's a small town,

647
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,440
it's still a commercial hub
of great importance.

648
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,270
Therefore,

649
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,320
it's bustling and crowded

650
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,720
with all sorts of people.

651
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,480
We must be very careful
during our stay there

652
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,030
and avoid causing any trouble.

653
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,830
Understand?

654
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,700
Why are you so happy?

655
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,320
It's clearly official business,

656
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,950
yet you insist on bringing me along,
an unrelated person.

657
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,200
You must fear
that the long distance between us

658
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
would cause me

659
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,110
to suffer great pain, right?

660
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,890
You must've

661
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,510
thought about me

662
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,970
out of concern, right?

663
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,570
You talk too much.

664
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,380
Hold on.

665
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,850
I carefully selected this.

666
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,100
It's for you.

667
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,040
You look quite idle!

668
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,880
Go to the backyard

669
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,210
and chop some firewood.

670
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,850
How can you be so unreasonable?

671
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,449
In the General's Residence,

672
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,360
I call the shots.

673
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,429
Yes,

674
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,630
General.

675
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,770
Did you get shy just now?

676
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,950
On my way to chop wood.

677
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,170
Is everything packed and ready?

678
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,920
Thank you for your care, Your Highness.

680

Everything has been arranged properly.

00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,840
We can set off early tomorrow morning.

682

I will not

disappoint you
on this mission, Your Highness.

684

I have given the Li family

so many chances, both openly and secretly.

686
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,730
Not only did they ignore them,

687
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,380
but they also secretly joined
Su Muyang's clique.

688
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,050
This time,

689
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,240
I'll definitely teach them a lesson.

690
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,370
Yes, Your Highness.

691
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,490
By all rights,

692
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,030
you are His Majesty's eldest son, versed

693
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,130
in both literature and military affairs,
respected by all officials.

694
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,530
Everyone expected you

695
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,760
to succeed the throne.

696
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,190
Yet three years ago,
when His Majesty named his heir,

697
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,230
why did he choose Su Muyang instead?

698
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,510
Father must have

699
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,240
his reasons for doing this.

700
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:35,980
Yes.

701
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,190
Besides,

702
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,500
there's no telling

703
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,690
if a cripple
can secure his position as Crown Prince.

704
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,400
Remember,

705
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,440
during your stay in Lucheng,

706
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,680
you should both show mercy
and put pressure.

707
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,920
If Li Shuang insists
on not changing her mind,

708
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,630
then...

709
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,130
Yes, Your Highness.
