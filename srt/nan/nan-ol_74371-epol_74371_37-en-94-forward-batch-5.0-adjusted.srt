[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,920
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,310
Her Majesty

4
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,950
had twins the first time

5
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,080
she was pregnant.

6
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,830
But one of the babies was born weak.

7
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,320
If he were to die in the palace,

8
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,350
it would be seen as a bad omen.

9
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,570
Back then,
Her Majesty was only a noble consort,

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,600
constantly restrained
by the previous Empress.

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,259
Her position was precarious—

12
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,070
she couldn't afford the slightest mistake.

13
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,850
So she had no choice

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,110
but to send the child out of the palace.

15
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,160
Don't cry.

16
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,720
Don't cry.

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,670
It's...

18
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,840
It's all my fault
that I couldn't keep you by my side.

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,460
Your Highness.

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,290
Go report to His Majesty

21
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,110
and the Empress

22
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,840
that I've given birth to a prince

23
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,600
and that both mother and child are safe.

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes.

25
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,330
Take him far away.

26
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,280
Never let him know the truth
about his birth.

27
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,480
How could the little prince

28
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
ever reunite with you in the future?

29
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
In this lifetime,

30
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,170
it's not meant to be.

31
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,630
Otherwise,

32
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,740
both of us would be killed.

33
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,200
Whether we reunite or not,

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,970
as long as he lives a few more years,

35
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,440
I'll be content.

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,300
Give the little prince

37
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,100
a name.

38
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,110
He was just born

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,230
and will be separated

40
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,040
from his family.

41
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,160
I just hope he can

42
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,600
forgive me for being so powerless.

43
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,150
Let's call him

44
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,400
Yan Han.

45
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,959
No one expected that Yan Han,
once declared

46
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,040
by the imperial physicians
to have little time left,

47
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,570
would survive so stubbornly
outside the palace.

48
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,840
I've raised him ever since,

49
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,120
under the guise of a distant relative.

50
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,750
I have something important to tell you.

51
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,550
His Majesty is going to name Huai
the Crown Prince.

52
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,630
I thought His Majesty
favored Lin the most,

53
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,720
saying he resembles the late emperor?

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Why did he choose Huai?

55
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,040
Huai is the eldest legitimate son.

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,370
Being named Crown Prince is only natural.

57
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,350
That's why Master gave strict orders

58
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,520
to take Han

59
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,020
far away from the capital,

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,640
in case anyone notices

61
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,430
how much he looks like Huai.

62
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,310
To be blunt,

63
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,720
the rules of the royal family
are truly inhumane.

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
They believe a newborn dying in the palace

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,600
is a bad omen.

66
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,010
I don't believe it.

67
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,950
But what choice did Master have?

68
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,280
If not for this superstition,

69
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,040
Han

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,840
wouldn't have ended up out of the palace.

71
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,080
Anyway, let's not talk about it anymore.

72
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,400
I'll head back to the palace now.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,330
I'll see you out.

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,600
Unfortunately,
I let my guard down for a moment,

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,130
and Yan Han learned the truth
about his birth.

76
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,610
From then on,
he bore hatred toward the Yan royal family

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,240
and secretly left home to join the army.

78
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,480
Back then,

79
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,190
they chose to let you live.

80
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,040
And now,

81
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,280
it's finally my turn.

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
The world

83
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,110
will be mine, after all.

84
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
A few years later,

85
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,130
when I heard that he personally executed

86
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,520
Fu Chengye, the rebel leader

87
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,250
who once gave him a chance,

88
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,110
and died in flames
to save the new emperor Yan Huai,

89
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,190
I knew the one thing

90
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,350
the Empress Dowager
feared most had come true.

91
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,600
The world believes His Majesty
was severely injured

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,550
while burning the forest
to destroy the rebels

93
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,480
and barely made it back
to the capital alive.

94
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
So the one who actually returned...

95
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,990
was Yan Han.

96
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,760
The very child born
with a black birthmark on his waist,

97
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,160
the one who was supposed
to be drowned at birth.

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,640
No wonder his handwriting
is different from before,

99
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,520
and he killed the Crown Prince
and Prince Cheng.

100
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,190
Ma'am Qian,

101
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,610
have you told the Empress about this?

102
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,670
Husband and wife
can be closest yet most distant.

103
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,330
The Empress has long been suspicious
of Yan Han.

104
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,090
After Yan Han returned to the capital,

105
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,590
he sent people to kill me.

106
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,190
With nowhere else to go, I had to hide

107
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,650
in the capital,
hoping to stay unnoticed in plain sight.

108
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,669
When I learned of the rift between
the Emperor and Empress,

109
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,669
I asked someone

110
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,520
to pass a message to the Empress.

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,590
Does the Empress Dowager know about this?

112
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,669
Your Highness, do you understand
a mother's heart?

113
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,309
The son she raised with her own hands

114
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,159
for over 20 or 30 years

115
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,540
was replaced by another.

116
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,600
How could Her Majesty truly not know?

117
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,320
It was just that they were both her sons.

118
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,040
And one was already gone.

119
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,970
How could she

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,570
have borne to lose the other?

121
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,160
Grandmother once said

122
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,710
there were only two times in her life
she followed her heart—

123
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,910
and both ended badly.

124
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,520
Could she have meant
sparing Yan Han's life

125
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,920
and hiding his identity?

126
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,830
Ma'am Qian,

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,830
do you know the consequences

128
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,280
if what you said today is false?

129
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
I've failed the Empress Dowager's trust.

130
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,310
I should've died to atone.

131
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,310
But I stayed alive

132
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,070
because I feared that, one day,

133
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,040
when the truth came to light,
there would be

134
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,070
no one left to testify for Her Majesty.

135
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,880
If I lied,

136
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,360
my life and death

137
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,830
are yours to decide.

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,730
If what Ma'am Qian said is true,

139
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,080
then Yan Li

140
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,610
is actually His Majesty's own son, right?

141
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,590
No wonder His Majesty claimed

142
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,640
a royal kinsman could inherit the throne,

143
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
and had the Crown Prince
and Prince Cheng executed.

144
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,250
It was all to clear the path for Yan Li.

145
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,310
I believe in Yan Li.

146
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,670
He knows nothing about this.

147
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,280
Besides, he has no interest in the throne.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,680
We'd better not tell him.

149
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,240
In all of this,

150
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,930
Yan Li and Sui are the most innocent.

151
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,440
And Grandmother is the most pitiful one.

152
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,270
Grandmother did this

153
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,400
to protect the bigger picture.

154
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,820
She never imagined

155
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,760
that in the end,
she would helplessly watch

156
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,590
her own flesh and blood
tear each other apart.

157
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,790
Grandmother's long years of endurance

158
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,680
are exactly
why her heart condition won't heal.

159
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,640
Tomorrow,

160
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,040
I'll go to the Imperial Hospital

161
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,500
to check her medical records
from back then.

162
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,190
When you visit her,

163
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,720
be careful with your words.

164
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,020
Yan Li and Sui

165
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,660
are both His Majesty's biological sons.

166
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,840
If we expose his true identity,

167
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,550
they'll hardly be able
to claim the throne.

168
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,830
Then

169
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,800
you would be the only legitimate heir
of the royal bloodline.

170
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,450
Have you ever thought about

171
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,780
taking that position?

172
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,070
I have no interest in the throne.

173
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,190
But how can the current Emperor's

174
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,880
behavior befit the role?

175
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,060
When one's virtue
doesn't match the position,

176
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,520
disaster will surely follow.

177
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,550
No matter when,

178
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,490
whoever inherits the throne

179
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,350
should be chosen for their merit.

180
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,490
Grandmother told us

181
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,760
to stay away from the palace intrigues.

182
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,470
But now it seems

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,800
you and I are about to stir up
an even greater storm.

184
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,470
Here.

185
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,650
Greetings, Grandmother.

186
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,800
Here you are.

187
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,360
Your eyes have fully recovered.

188
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,040
Thanks to your acupuncture skills,

189
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,030
my eyes can see the light again.

190
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,310
But acupuncture only helps
with blood circulation.

191
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,710
Little Wan'er, it's all thanks to you.

192
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,670
With Ze's eyes healed,

193
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,400
my heart feels finally at ease.

194
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,000
I think you should drop the title

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,880
"medical fairy"

196
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,320
and change it to "medical god".

197
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,050
Grandmother, please stop joking.

198
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,410
You're going to lose

199
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,610
this game of chess.

200
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,760
Brother.

201
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,360
Grandmother, you're playing chess.

202
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,890
Ze called me over in a hurry.

203
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,150
I thought...

204
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,380
Watch what you're saying.

205
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,120
I called you here

206
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,370
because I wanted to see you properly.

207
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,080
Since I developed my eye condition,

208
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,790
I've never had the chance to witness

209
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,450
your appearance as Prince Yi.

210
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,010
Just now when you entered,

211
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,830
I almost

212
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,800
mistook you

213
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,940
for His Majesty.

214
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,790
Now that you mention it,

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,860
he really does look a bit like him.

216
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,340
Look at him holding Yan Sui—

217
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,300
they look

218
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,280
just like

219
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,120
real brothers.

220
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,790
Do we?

221
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,880
Then Sui's lucky.

222
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,770
I'm quite handsome,

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,570
you know.

224
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,890
I can't play like this.

225
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,310
You're too noisy.

226
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,240
My head is spinning.

227
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,250
You should all leave for now.

228
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,030
Let's go play outside.

229
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,170
[Funing Palace]

230
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,240
What would you like to eat?

231
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,850
Would you like something to eat?

232
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,310
Do you want some pastries?

233
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,800
Here, take this.

234
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,240
Okay, this one.

235
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,950
Easy.

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's just her old headache
acting up again.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,260
It's nothing serious.

238
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,230
Let's not disturb her

239
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,240
and just let her rest for a few days.

240
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,360
Then I shall respectfully follow
Grandmother's decree.

241
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Why did you mention the resemblance

242
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,510
between Yan Li and Yan Sui
in front of Grandmother?

243
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,320
You know the human body very well.

244
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,310
Of course, you can keenly spot

245
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,970
similarities in appearance.

246
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,250
But Grandmother's eyesight is poor.

247
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,980
She needed a little reminder.

248
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,760
Thankfully,

249
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,990
my vision is now fully restored.

250
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,350
Heaven has truly shown me mercy.

251
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,330
Chi is here.

252
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,860
What really caused the deaths of my mother

253
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,130
and Yan Chi's mother?

254
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,410
Who was behind it?

255
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,840
Haven't you and Chi found the truth yet?

256
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,160
I'll go tell them
the Empress Dowager is fine.

257
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,560
I'll leave you two alone.

258
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,520
Eat slowly.

259
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
What's wrong?

260
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,770
Is something wrong with Ze?

261
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,040
Sui.

262
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,480
He deliberately pointed out

263
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,060
in front of Grandmother

264
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,660
that Yan Li and Yan Sui
look like real brothers.

265
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,240
I think

266
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,090
he has long known Yan Han's true identity.

267
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,050
Grandmother is fine.

268
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,830
Don't worry.

269
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,570
He traveled outside for many years.

270
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,830
How could he possibly know such a secret?

271
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,390
I'll send the Dove Unit to investigate.

272
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,930
This is another unexpected secret.

273
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,890
What have you found?

274
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,360
I checked Grandmother's
old medical records.

275
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
Only the one from
His Majesty's birth is missing.

276
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
Also, the old imperial physician

277
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,480
suddenly died
on his way home after retirement.

278
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,540
It seems that Yan Han

279
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,740
destroyed the evidence

280
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,070
to cover up his true identity.

281
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,740
He clearly went too far

282
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,380
in covering up his flaws.

283
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,000
Thank you.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,860
Young Marshal.

285
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,920
Young Marshal.

286
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,780
Your Highness.

287
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,450
Greetings.

288
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,980
You and I are relatives.

289
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,240
No need for such formalities
in the future.

290
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,400
How is Shuang doing?

291
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,070
Is her morning sickness still severe?

292
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,430
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

293
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,430
Shuang's morning sickness is mild,

294
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,590
her appetite is good,

295
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,720
and she sleeps well.

296
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,760
I'll go to your residence
to check on her in a few days.

297
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,240
Okay.

298
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,070
By the way,

299
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,280
I

300
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,540
have something important to report to you,
Young Marshal.

301
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,190
What is it?

302
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,640
Recently, several new faces appeared
in the Palace Guard Division,

303
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,710
all from the Northern Army
of the Zhao family.

304
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,920
They never served in the capital before,

305
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,560
but upon arrival, Vice Commissioner Zhao

306
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
assigned them to guard the palace gates.

307
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,960
Many of our brothers and I

308
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,950
were sent to guard the city gates.

309
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,640
I see.

310
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,119
Don't rush to leave.

311
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,030
Once I take office tomorrow,

312
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,599
I'll see who dares
to transfer you out of the palace.

313
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,060
Thank you, Young Marshal.

314
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm not...

315
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,880
trying to use our connection
for special treatment.

316
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,210
It's just that this redeployment
seems really suspicious.

317
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,470
The palace gates are restricted areas.

318
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,960
The guards there
would never be replaced without reason.

319
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,020
You informing me is part of your duty.

320
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,190
If you notice anything suspicious
in the future,

321
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,790
report it to me immediately.

322
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,360
Yes.

323
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't worry, Young Marshal.

324
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,710
The people of Lord Zhao
are trying to control the palace defenses.

325
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,350
The Empress might take action soon.

326
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,750
But aren't you afraid
that redeploying the palace guards

327
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,760
without authorization
will raise his suspicions?

328
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,960
His suspicion of me has never lessened.

329
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,370
Rather than taking hits passively,

330
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,970
it's better to prepare early

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,860
while the enemy remains unaware.

332
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,940
[Yan Han]

333
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,660
The mystery of Yan Han's identity

334
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
is like the final piece
of the Yan Ji puzzle.

335
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,030
Once it's in place,

336
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,670
all the tangled clues

337
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,160
and the connections between the victims

338
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,220
will become clear.

339
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,500
Yan Han did all this

340
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,360
to conceal his identity.

341
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,270
That's why

342
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,830
Princess Xin died,

343
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,650
Mother died,

344
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,360
Consort Jin died,

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,410
Prince Jin died,

346
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,830
and my father

347
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,430
died.

348
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,470
Princess Xin must have discovered
that black birthmark

349
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,390
while treating Yan Han's wounds.

350
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,690
[Princess Xin]

351
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,800
This hemostatic and healing bandage

352
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,840
must be applied directly to the wound.

353
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,030
If the bleeding continues,

354
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,950
call me immediately.

355
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,480
I'll be waiting right here.

356
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,180
Your Highness!

357
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,420
Please come quickly!

358
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,360
His Majesty's wound has reopened!

359
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,880
I almost mistook your birthmark

360
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,340
for rotten flesh just now.

361
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,500
Luckily, I noticed it in time.

362
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,620
Your Majesty, you're out of danger now.

363
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,680
I'll take my leave.

364
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,670
Ask Princess Xin to have some food

365
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,640
and tea before she leaves.

366
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,750
As you command.

367
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,320
His Majesty has granted you tea.

368
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,650
Thank you, Eunuch Yuan.

369
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,660
Back then, my mother
had just given birth not long ago.

370
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,390
Princess Xin went to visit her,

371
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,160
which led to her being killed.

372
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,790
Your Majesty,

373
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,840
the Investigation Department reported that

374
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,190
after leaving the palace, Princess Xin

375
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,850
went to Prince Rui's Mansion.

376
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,990
She stayed with Princess Rui

377
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,800
for an hour before leaving.

378
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,510
The two princesses are close friends.

379
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,190
And Princess Rui has recently given birth.

380
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,450
Princess Xin likely went to check on her.

381
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,580
Kill her.

382
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,420
Consort Jin entered the palace
after His Majesty suppressed the rebellion.

383
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,340
She was the only consort who bore a child

384
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,130
with the false emperor Yan Han.

385
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,830
Coming from a scholarly family,

386
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
she discovered His Majesty's calligraphy

387
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,200
when he was Crown Prince
at Linglong Pavilion.

388
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,280
She found flaws

389
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,750
in the handwriting.

390
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,160
And she was foolish enough
to take that scroll

391
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,470
to confront Yan Han,

392
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,810
which led her to her death.

393
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
Prince Jin

394
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,720
was waiting near Yong'an Palace

395
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,780
because he promised to give a gift to Sui.

396
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,940
Upon hearing Consort Jin's screams,

397
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,570
he rushed over to save her.

398
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,970
Let's go take a look!

399
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,160
Sui!

400
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,320
I'm here!

401
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,430
Go find help quickly!

402
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,010
Yes.

403
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,850
If the Emperor's killing of a consort

404
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,110
were to become public,

405
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,040
it would surely cause turmoil
in the court.

406
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,950
To protect the stability of the nation,

407
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,670
Prince Jin chose
to cover up Yan Han's crime

408
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,100
but revealed the truth to my father.

409
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,000

the country's foundation,

411
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,360
chose to help Prince Jin

412
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,750

the north is suffering a spring famine.

the Northern Army stationed in Hebei

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,670

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,120
to...

458
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,560
Prefecture in Hedong
to secure food and fodder.

459
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,400
Your Majesty, you're wise.

460
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,080
Also,

461
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,870
order the Tiger Unit
of the Huaiyang Army in eastern Jingdong

462
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,800
to return to the capital

463
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,440
to prevent riots by displaced people.

464
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,570
As you command.

465
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,160
Your Majesty, should we summon
the Deputy Minister of Revenue

466
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,080
to discuss disaster relief in the north?

467
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,880
No need.

468
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,600
My realm

469
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,880
is peaceful.

470
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
There is no famine.

471
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,200
I deserve to be slapped
for speaking out of turn.

472
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,290
Has there been

473
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,130
any unusual activity recently

474
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,450
in Fengyi Palace?

475
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,950
The Investigation Department reported that

476
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,280
the Empress was very pleased to hear that

477
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,890
the commoner Yan Qi is dead.

478
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,610
Afterward,
she still sits silently every day.

479
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,800
She must

480
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,610
have no worries left.

481
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,690
Strengthen palace security in recent days.

482
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,190
Order the Investigation Department
to keep a close watch on Fengyi Palace.

483
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,990
If another incident like the massacre

484
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,020
at Prince Cheng's Mansion happens,

485
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,230
you, the Chief Eunuch,

486
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,470
will go serve at Fengyi Palace.

487
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,430
Yes.

488
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,590
[Fengyi Palace]

489
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,700
He is very alert.

490
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,330
We must not let him notice us.

491
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,340
Sir.

492
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,000
Thank you, sir.

493
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,570
Young Marshal.

494
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,470
Earlier, Vice Commissioner Zhao

495
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,950
had just replaced the guards
at Fengyi Palace

496
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,080
when Prince Xin immediately went
to wait outside to pay his respects.

497
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,540
I think the whole thing
seemed prearranged.

498
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,840
Yan Ze?

499
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,710
Yes.

500
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,560
Did he speak with the Empress

501
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,690
or pass on a message?

502
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,190
I didn't dare get too close,

503
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,140
so I didn't see clearly.

504
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
But I suppose they

505
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,490
could have spoken through the door crack.

506
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,770
Are you on duty today?

507
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,300
I was originally assigned
to patrol the inner city tonight,

508
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,210
but at noon,

509
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,270
Vice Commissioner Zhao said

510
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,030
the guards at the Imperial Clan Court
needed reinforcement,

511
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,100
so our entire shift was reassigned there.

512
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,440
This kind of sudden redeployment

513
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,960
felt off to me,

514
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,190
so I kept following him.

515
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,230
You did the right thing.

516
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,160
Could it be...

517
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,720
that he plans to rescue the Empress
from the palace tonight?

518
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm afraid there's an even bigger plot.

519
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,110
Go inform the others immediately that,

520
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,730
regardless of whether they're
on duty tonight,

521
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,950
they must find an excuse
to stay in the guardroom.

522
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,750
But you can't make
Vice Commissioner Zhao suspicious.

523
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,320
Yes.

524
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,510
Your Highness.

525
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,120
Prefect Zheng, have you found anything?

526
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,250
It was my oversight.

527
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,240
In Li Muyun's old case files,

528
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,190
we found descriptions

529
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,950
of the Heavenly Way Society's
killing methods.

530
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,210
Yet during the trial,
he never once mentioned the society.

531
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,840
Also,

532
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,950
during the serial murders in Guanyin Town,

533
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,230
he visited
the local governor's office there.

534
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,510
It was even his suggestion
to arrest Zhang Dongxuan.

535
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,710
But before the trial concluded,

536
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,190
he returned to his jurisdiction.

537
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,030
The governor of Guanyin Town

538
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,690
even thanked him
for not trying to claim credit.

539
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,400
Li Muyun knew these killing methods

540
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,750
were linked to the Heavenly Way Society,

541
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,080
yet he never said a word—

542
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,190
and even deliberately concealed
his trip to Guanyin Town.

543
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,430
He was not only covering up
for the Heavenly Way Society

544
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,430
but also hiding his own ties to them.

545
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,030
Also,

546
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,600
today I followed Li Muyun to a residence

547
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,430
in Tianshui Alley in the east of the city.

548
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,080
I investigated the homeowner

549
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,810
of the house.

550
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,410
He's nothing special,

551
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,950
but the property
deed shows a recorded resale.

552
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,670
Six years ago,

553
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,000
the owner was Ning Buyi.

554
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,370
This is no coincidence.

555
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,270
Li Muyun must have some connection
with Ning Buyi.

556
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,400
Why are you back?

557
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,190
I'll explain later.

558
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,220
Prefect Zheng,
have you found anything else?

559
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,060
I found Ning Buyi's case files

560
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,850
suspicious

561
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
compared to previous ones.

562
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,430
A witness from Guanyin Town said that

563
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,230
besides Zhang Dongxuan, two young men

564
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,830
were seen at the crime scene.

565
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,270
One was Ning Buyi,

566
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,300
and the other was a blind young man

567
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,160
holding a cane.

568
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,980
A blind young man?

569
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,510
The witness said the blind young man

570
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,850
had an extraordinary presence

571
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,160
and looked quite refined,

572
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,820
so he remembered him clearly.

573
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,190
After Lord Shen classified

574
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,750
Guanyin Town's case files
as unsolved case files,

575
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,600
did Li Muyun ever access them?

576
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,920
Yes, he did.

577
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,880
But he only had someone

578
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,620
remove the parts annotated by Lord Shen.

579
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,670
The rest showed no signs of alteration.

580
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,160
Li Muyun is cautious
with official documents.

581
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,880
He doesn't tamper with evidence

582
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,320
that can be verified by witnesses,

583
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,190
so he won't get caught
in a situation he can't explain.

584
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,190
This is actually

585
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,360
what he taught me about being an official.

586
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,760
Today,
Yan Ze went alone to see the Empress.

587
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,980
If that blind young man is him,

588
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,160
then all the strange things

589
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,990
make sense.

590
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,990
That blind young man

591
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,600
is Yan Ze, Prince Xin?

592
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,750
For the past ten years,

593
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,360
Yan Ze has been
seeking medical treatment outside,

594
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
but no one knows exactly what he did.

595
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,190
With his demeanor and eloquence,

596
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,640
it wouldn't be hard
to win over aloof people

597
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,840
like Li Muyun and Ning Buyi.

598
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,230
Besides, the late Princess Xin
had been in the capital,

599
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,080
providing medical treatment
to the city's nobility

600
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,480
and earning many favors.

601
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,560
If Yan Ze wanted to use these connections

602
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,120
to bring Ning Buyi
and Li Muyun into the capital,

603
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,670
it wouldn't be a problem.

604
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,920
This means

605
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,270
Yan Ze has known all along that

606
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,470
the late Princess Xin
was killed by His Majesty.

607
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,190
That's why he said Sui and Yan Li

608
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,590
look very alike that day.

609
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,230
He knows the Emperor is an impostor.

610
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,840
What is the purpose

611
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,240
behind all his planning?

612
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,330
It's still unknown for now.

613
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,080
However,

614
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,400
judging by today's sudden guard shift

615
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,060
at the Palace Guard Division,

616
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,320
they must be making a move tonight.

617
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,920
Wan,

618
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,190
extraordinary times call
for extraordinary measures.

619
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,600
We don't have time for gathering evidence.

620
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,840
Let's do this my way.

621
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,800
Alright.

622
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,060
I'll follow your lead.

623
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,720
Heavens.

624
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,870
The capital is about to
descend into chaos.

625
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,600
Constable Zhan, please assign people

626
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,360
to watch all major routes in the capital.

627
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,800
Arrest anyone who tries to break through

628
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,080
or cause trouble immediately.

629
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,560
Yes.

630
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,710
Prefect Zheng,

631
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,270
please increase night patrols

632
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,510
and control key routes in the city.

633
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,560
Inspect suspicious activities

634
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,030
and eliminate fire hazards.

635
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,030
Yes.

636
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,840
Your Highness, the medicine box is ready.

637
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,950
Order the Black Armor Guards

638
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,230
into the city to assist the Patrol Department
in guarding the inner city.

639
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,710
Be alert for traitors in the Imperial Guard
trying to cause chaos.

640
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,470
No one is allowed into the imperial city
without an imperial edict.

641
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,230
Yes.

642
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,110
I'll go with you.

643
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,020
I promised

644
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,180
to stand by your side
through life and death,

645
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,990
never to part.

646
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,510
Then we shall be together
through life and death,

647
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,310
never to part.

648
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,800
Your Highness.

649
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,830
Be careful with everything.

650
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,190
Where are the guards?

651
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,850
When Father loses his temper,

652
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,920
he usually sends everyone out.

653
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,800
Why don't we come back tomorrow
to see His Majesty,

654
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,550
so we don't catch him in a bad mood

655
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,030
and get scolded for nothing?

656
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,070
I've been practicing
my calligraphy diligently.

657
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,530
Why would Father scold me?

658
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,280
I haven't, alright?

659
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,429
If we don't go now, once His Majesty is here,
we won't be able to leave.

660
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
What's that?

661
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,679
Run!

662
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:43,949
Why won't it open?

663
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,030
Hurry, follow up!

664
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,810
This way!

665
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,199
I'm so scared.

666
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:00,150
Don't be afraid. Come with me.

667
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,150
Once we enter the palace gate,

668
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,950
act according to the situation.

669
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,920
I am Princess Rui.

670
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,050
I'm here to treat the Empress Dowager.

671
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,030
The palace gates are locked.

672
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,400
Princess Rui, please leave.

673
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,320
It's not even 7 p.m. yet.

674
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,030
Why are the gates already locked?

675
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,360
If the Empress Dowager's condition
worsens because of this,

676
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,630
can you take responsibility?

677
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,160
If you don't open the gates,

678
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll ask Prince Rui
to come and reason with you.

679
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,360
Your Highness, please wait.

680
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,020
I'll open the gate right away.

681
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,310
Speak! Where is your master?

682
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,720
It's a deadly poison.

683
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,120
It's too late to save him.

684
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,840
They're all loyal death guards
of the Empress and Yan Ze.

685
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,400
I'm afraid a palace coup is brewing.

686
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,920
Wan,

687
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,280
we must split up now.

688
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,680
You go to Funing Palace
to take care of the Empress Dowager

689
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,510
and Sui.

690
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,450
I'll go save Yan Han.

691
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,090
If he dies as the Emperor,

692
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,590
tonight's coup will truly
spiral out of control.

693
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,240
Master!

694
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,030
Master,

695
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,360
all our men are in position.

696
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,070
Deputy Captain Xue's men
haven't signaled yet.

697
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,680
Seems no one in the city
is causing trouble.

698
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,950
You accompany Princess Wan
to Funing Palace,

699
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,750
find Yue Ning,

700
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,760
and protect the Empress Dowager and Sui.

701
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,110
Yes.

702
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,320
The blue one is for stopping bleeding.

703
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,740
The white one is taken internally
as an antidote.

704
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,070
You know how to use them.

705
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,260
If you dare to die,

706
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,890
I'll make you a dried corpse
to keep me company.

707
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,060
I won't give you that chance.

708
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:52,830
Go now.

709
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,120
Let's go.

710
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,320
Li.

711
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,320
Why is the door closed?

712
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
There are dead bodies everywhere.

713
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,950
I'm so scared.

714
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,400
Don't be afraid.

715
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,990
I'll go to the bedchamber
to check on His Majesty.

716
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,870
You hide in the back.

717
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,420
Remember,

718
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,360
besides me, Chi, and Wan,

719
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,520
don't come out for anyone else.

720
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,560
Li, don't go.

721
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,400
What if Father gets angry

722
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,630
and treats you like he did my mother?

723
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,530
That won't happen.

724
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,800
My martial arts are excellent.

725
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,750
If worst comes to worst,

726
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,680
I can always run,

727
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,320
and no one can catch me.

728
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,120
Then come back as soon as you can.

729
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,770
Good boy.

730
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:47,950
Go now.

731
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,680
Go.

732
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,400
Be careful.

733
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,230
Young Marshal,

734
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,320
something's wrong,

735
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,360
Tonight, all the guards
at the inner gate are unfamiliar faces.

736
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,130
They're definitely not from
the Palace Guard Division.

737
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,510
These men only stand watch
at the palace gates without lighting lamps.

738
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,570
I can't see what's happening inside,

739
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,240
so I dare not act rashly.

740
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,360
Is His Majesty inside?

741
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,950
Yes.

742
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,590
Earlier,

743
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,110
Prince Yi and Prince Sui just went in

744
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,880
and haven't come out yet.

745
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,940
When did they go in?

746
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,230
About 15 minutes ago.

747
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,500
We can't wait any longer.

748
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,550
Proceed according to plan.

749
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,990
Yes.

750
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,430
Ma'am Chen,

751
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,550
why haven't Yan Li and Sui returned yet?

752
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,400
Indeed.

753
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,760
The gates are about to be locked.

754
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,150
I'll send someone to check right now.

755
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,480
Good.

756
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,280
Ning.

757
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,920
Little Wan'er?

758
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,510
Why are you here?

759
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,430
Where is Prince Sui?

760
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,240
Just now, someone from Zichen Hall said

761
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,400
His Majesty wanted to check on
Yan Li and Sui's studies.

762
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
So they went over there.

763
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,150
What's wrong?

764
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,880
Ma'am Chen,

765
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,240
lock the palace gate tightly.

766
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,280
No one is allowed
in or out during this time.

767
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,990
Yes.

768
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,880
What's happening?

769
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,800
Is Yan Li in danger?

770
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,720
I'll explain to you later.

771
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,590
Let's go find them first.

772
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,250
Okay.

773
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,540
Welcome, Your Highness.

774
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,260
[Fengyi Palace]

775
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,150
The prisoner is awake.

776
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,560
We can begin.

777
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,170
Yes,

778
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,290
Society Leader.

779
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:06,680
Yuan Qing.

780
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,680
What are you doing?

781
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,920
You dare to kill the Emperor?

782
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,260
I've seen all the injustice
in this palace.

783
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,450
There's nothing I'm afraid to do.

784
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,840
Wan Xi

785
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,720
and Kang Bowen

786
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,630
were so loyal to you.

787
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,090
But what happened to them?

788
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,800
All these years,

789
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,070
I've done plenty of dirty work for you.

790
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,880
Sooner or later
I'll be disposed of like a used tool.

791
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,360
But the world I want hasn't come to pass.

792
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,920
I'm not ready to die.

793
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
So if anyone must die,

794
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,520
it can only be you, Your Majesty.

795
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,030
You...

796
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,240
Bastard!

797
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,030
Bastard!

798
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,880
Heaven's way is unjust.

799
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,030
Only by tirelessly

800
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,200
cleansing the filth

801
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,680
can the righteous way
of Heaven be restored.

802
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,280
The righteous way
of Heaven has been restored.

803
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,940
Society Leader,
you have achieved great merit.

804
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,240
Who are you?

805
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,590
Don't you know

806
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,840
this is treason?

807
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,200
Treason?

808
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,990
My whole life's work

809
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,590
is to correct chaos

810
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,990
and uphold Heaven's justice.

811
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,730
Yan Ze?

812
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,810
Yes, it's me,

813
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,090
the orphan
who lost both parents because of you,

814
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,800
Yan Ze.

815
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,320
On guard!

816
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,060
My blade only spills the blood

817
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,640
of nomadic enemies and treasonous rebels.

818
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,820
If you don't want to die,

819
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,410
surrender now.

820
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,510
Vice Commissioner Zhao,

821
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,070
if you move first,

822
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,510
I'll kill him.

823
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,630
Prince Rui,

824
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,880
the Empress deceived me.

825
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,370
They're not the Northern Army!

826
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,300
They're the Heavenly Way Society!

827
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,150
Attack!

828
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,630
Attack!
