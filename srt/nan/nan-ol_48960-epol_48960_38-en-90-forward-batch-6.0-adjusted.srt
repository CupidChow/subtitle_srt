[Episode 38]

4
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,900
It's no use coughing.

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,820
Didn't I tell you?

6
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,550
You'll only get a bowl of porridge every two days.

7
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,100
My dear boy, I'm not coughing.

8
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm not hungry either.

9
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm angry.

10
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,740
The other day, that Shan fellow came to quarrel with me.

11
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,180
I didn't stand up to him well.

12
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,810
Call him over now.

13
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
I'll argue with him properly again.

14
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,660
I can't believe you take quarreling that seriously.

15
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,220
I wonder why Master is even keeping

16
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,260
a blind fool like you alive.

17
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,980
Stop thinking about it.

18
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,580
Shan went down the mountain long ago.

19
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,910
Went down the mountain?

20
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,660
So we're currently staying

21
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,860
on this mountain huh?

22
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,860
Isn't it quite inconvenient for you to go down the mountain

23
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,120
to enter the city then?

24
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,950
If only we could enter the city.

25
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,960
Ruyi City is more than a dozen li away.

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,900
Just going out to buy groceries will take a day of walking.

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,380
Ruyi City is more than a dozen li away.

28
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,630
That is some distance away.

29
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,680
Forget it then.

30
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,470
Looks like I won't be able to

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,180
quarrel with Shan.

32
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,060
Why am I not locked up

33
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,120
with other people?

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,260
You mean you won't be bored if there's someone else to quarrel with?

35
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,780
There is someone else besides you.

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,140
But he's being confined in Master's room.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,740
Master treats him differently,

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,140
and visits him every day.

39
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,190
Master doesn't allow us to talk about him.

40
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,320
-Palace Commander.
-Palace Commander.
-Palace Commander.

41
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,320
Palace Commander.

42
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,500
His Majesty has never missed the morning court assembly.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,300
We would like to see His Majesty.

44
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,780
You are by His Majesty's side every day.

45
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,380
How is His Majesty's health?

46
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,940
I have something important to report to His Majesty.

47
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,060
I request to see His Majesty.

48
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,970
Please let His Majesty know.

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,160
-We request to see His Majesty.
-Guards!

50
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,790
What are you doing?

51
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,000
What are you doing?

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,630
Palace Commander!

53
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,690
What are you doing?

54
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,410
Palace Commander!

55
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,420
Why are you doing this?

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,950
Are you intending to rebel?

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,540
What?

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,980
Xuanyuan Xiao dared to arrest high-ranking officials?

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,780
The Minister of War,

60
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,820
the Minister of Rites,

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,380
on top of the Minister of Revenue, Lord Fang previously.

62
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,420
only the Minister of Industry is left in the six ministries.

63
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,260
Lord Xuanyuan also issued a verbal instruction from His Majesty,

64
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,540
saying that New Year's Eve is coming.

65
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,380
This year's Sacrifice to Heaven will be changed to a Nuo Sacrifice Ceremony,

66
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,940
and will be moved to Zhurong Hall at the suburbs of the capital.

67
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,500
They want to make it extravagant.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,230
Impossible.

69
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,690
The Nuo Sacrifice Ceremony is overly extravagant,

70
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,570
and will cost a lot of money.

71
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,940
It's already been abolished for a hundred years.

72
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,740
Father will never make such a decision.

73
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,860
I'm going to see Father now.

74
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,640
Did you hear that His Majesty is ill?

75
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,900
He can't come into contact with the wind.

76
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,390
So he's been staying in his sleeping chamber.

77
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,040
The Imperial City Division is guarding the door too.

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
No one is allowed in.

79
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,220
There must be something wrong with Xuanyuan Xiao.

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,750
Even if I have to take a risk,

81
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,010
I must see Father.

82
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,910
Li Lianhua gave me a lot of useful things previously.

83
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,820
I'm sure they'll come in handy.

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,560
[Yi'an Hall]

85
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,750
His Majesty gave the order that

86
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,590
he won't see anyone.

87
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,710
I must see him.

88
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,659
Father!

89
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,810
Father!

90
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,409
Father, what's wrong?

91
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,990
From three days ago,

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,170
I've been weak and couldn't get up.

93
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,280
Xuanyuan Xiao brought the imperial physician to see me.

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,740
They said my energy is depleted and I'm weak, and I need to rest.

95
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,430
I didn't believe it,

96
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,500
and I tested myself with a silver needle.

97
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,120
It looks like I have symptoms of poisoning.

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
This Xuanyuan Xiao is so audacious.

99
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,480
Father, what should we do?

100
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,360
Now Xuanyuan Xiao is no longer Xuanyuan Xiao.

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,340
Strange things are happening in the palace.

102
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,200
Something big will be happening.

103
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,540
The princess is disrupting His Majesty's quiet rest.

104
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,290
Take her back to Zhaohua Hall and watch her closely.

105
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,490
Without my order, she is not to come out.

106
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,450
You...

107
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,130
Father.

108
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,900
-Donâ€™t be afraid.
-Father.

109
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,600
Don't be afraid.

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,360
Father!

111
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,850
The smell of the medicine in this porridge is so strong.

112
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,100
How am I supposed to eat it?

113
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,900
The medicine is being served as porridge.

114
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,470
Looks like the cook today

115
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,960
has been changed to a medicine peddler.

116
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,220
Li Xiangyi.

117
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,050
You lost your sight,

118
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,080
but your sense of smell is still pretty sharp.

119
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,659
So it's Gang Leader Jiao we have here.

120
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,440
Sect Leader Li.

121
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,060
You were so powerful back then.

122
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,220
Looking at you now,

123
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,550
you must have suffered much

124
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,650
over these past few years.

125
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,140
How much I've suffered,

126
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,540
shouldn't your spies know

127
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,580
even better than me?

128
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,050
Li Xiangyi.

129
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,130
You should know the reason

130
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,410
why I'm not killing you.

131
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,010
It doesn't matter if Li Lianhua is dead or alive.

132
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,490
But for Li Xiangyi,

133
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,990
that's not the case.

134
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,060
I'm here today to tell you two pieces of good news.

135
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,970
Have a feel.

136
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,090
These clothes aren't made too well.

137
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,270
But I think it should suit you quite well.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,480
This is a piece of armor.

139
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,930
This is made exactly according to

140
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,159
what the powerful Li Xiangyi wore on the day

141
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,020
Sigu Sect was first founded.

142
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm gifting it to you.

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,140
You don't have to give it to me.

144
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,930
You should give it to Shan Gudao.

145
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,450
This is what he asked me to make for you.

146
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,510
On the day he succeeds in his plan,

147
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,090
he wants you to wear this armor

148
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,250
and kneel respectfully at his feet.

149
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,010
Then he will be disappointed.

150
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,690
I can't see clearly now.

151
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,010
No matter how glorious he looks, I won't be able to see it.

152
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,340
No wonder Shan Gudao hates you so much.

153
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,799
You have a glib tongue.

154
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,659
But look at you now.

155
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,559
What's the use of having a glib tongue?

156
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,290
I guess you can use it to drink wine.

157
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,920
Let's talk about the second piece of good news.

158
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,380
Let me guess.

159
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,960
Could it be...

160
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,560
a wedding toast?

161
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,210
Bingo.

162
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,410
This is a toast for the lord and I's wedding.

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,800
You must drink it.

164
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,800
I don't know if Director Di is happy about this though.

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,810
Director Di's taste

166
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,770
has become like this now?

167
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,490
What do you know?

168
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm gifting him the world as dowry,

169
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,520
and giving him my heart.

170
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,400
Isn't he satisfied?

171
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,510
So you want the world too.

172
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,530
Bingo again.

173
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,990
I think

174
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,400
no one is your match now.

175
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,740
It's not that you can't do it. You're just tired of it.

176
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,770
So now you want to take the throne.

177
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,510
I was originally a Nanyin royal.

178
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,650
Why can't I be the emperor?

179
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,200
Why can't I do

180
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,180
what those men can do?

181
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,540
But there is only one throne.

182
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,520
It seems that you are not on the same side as Shan Gudao.

183
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,820
Of course the throne belongs to me.

184
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,010
What about Di Feisheng?

185
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,390
Don't tell me...

186
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,250
you want him to be the empress?

187
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,520
Empress?

188
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,690
Li Xiangyi.

189
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,470
You're getting more interesting now.

190
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,590
How about... I marry you too?

191
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
What do you think?

192
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,190
But three days later

193
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,280
will be my wedding day with Di Feisheng.

194
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,680
I need you to officiate our marriage for me.

195
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,240
Don't be jealous.

196
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,600
When I become the emperor,

197
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,990
you'll have the chance to humor me.

198
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,410
Are you that sure

199
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,350
you'll be the one to win in the end?

200
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,500
Since Shan Gudao has the mother bug of the Karmic Bug,

201
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,160
he thinks he's guaranteed to win,

202
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,890
and has nothing to worry about.

203
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,120
He doesn't even know that I can destroy

204
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,030
that mother bug easily.

205
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,060
Talking to you is so dangerous.

206
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,110
Earlier I was careless,

207
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,540
and you made me spill so many secrets.

208
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,310
You don't believe I'll kill you?

209
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,460
If I die,

210
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,610
who else will attend your wedding with Di Feisheng?

211
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,460
I'm afraid no one will sing congratulatory songs for you.

212
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,740
It's not very appropriate for a wedding to be

213
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,000
quiet and empty, is it?

214
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,830
Li Xiangyi, good for you.

215
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,980
Let's wait and see.

216
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,440
Oh Di Feisheng...

217
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,870
Having the affection of someone like her is really dangerous.

218
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,630
I work for the Imperial City Division.

219
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,940
Why won't you let me enter the inner palace?

220
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,580
Lord Yang.

221
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,160
This is the Emperor's order conveyed by the Palace Commander.

222
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,300
Without His Majesty's special permission,

223
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,040
no one can enter the inner palace.

224
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,900
Please go back.

225
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,200
I want to go out.

226
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,700
Let me out!

227
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,190
I'm just going out for a walk.

228
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,460
Say something!

229
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,180
Let me out!

230
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,620
Don't!

231
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,050
Father is sick in bed.

232
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,530
But yet I can't even see him.

233
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,100
You people from the Imperial City Division are such bullies!

234
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,820
All the court officials are either arrested by you,

235
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,620
or chased out.

236
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,290
All the important officials in the capital

237
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,870
and the generals' families have been arrested.

238
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,070
What else do you want?

239
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,510
Master!

240
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:31,880
Master.

241
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,940
What's wrong?

242
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,350
You've been bewitched by them.

243
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,310
It's the Karmic Bug.

244
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,000
Master, you've been loyal all your life.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
How could they do this to you?

246
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,590
Master.

247
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,740
Go find Li Xiangyi.

248
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Save His Majesty.

249
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,750
Go, quickly!

250
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,290
Master!

251
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,870
Go!

252
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,390
Quickly!

253
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,490
I want to eat.

254
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,920
It's not two days yet.

255
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,140
What are you yelling about?

256
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,800
Even if it's not two days yet, I should still eat.

257
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,820
Why?

258
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,930
You ask why?

259
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,570
My dear boy,

260
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,020
you're not being very loyal here.

261
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,890
I helped you to make a contribution.

262
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,450
Aren't you going to feed me in return?

263
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,540
You agree to wear that armor?

264
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,400
Yes.

265
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
Your master is so beautiful.

266
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,950
She'll be angry if I don't wear it.

267
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,060
You are indeed thirsting for

268
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,190
my master's beauty.

269
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,940
I still thought you were a man of integrity.

270
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,670
Hey, watch what you're saying.

271
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,040
I wonder how your master

272
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,950
is treating this Di Feisheng.

273
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,170
What else, Master cut his tendons and tied him up.

274
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,370
He can't go anywhere.

275
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,440
Di Feisheng used to kill countless people.

276
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,640
But now he's only my master's prisoner.

277
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,580
Eat up.

278
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,170
Smells good.

279
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,930
Let's not be in a hurry,

280
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,460
I'll have a few bites first.

281
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,390
Not that I want to criticize you,

282
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,860
but you two are so bad at making your master happy.

283
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,450
If you call her here directly,

284
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,170
how can you show your ability?

285
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,310
If you call her after

286
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,550
I put on this armor,

287
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,080
this will all be your work.

288
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,840
Right?

289
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,970
Sorry, kids.

290
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,590
Have a good rest for now.

291
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,810
I need to go save an old friend.

292
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,420
So Jiao Liqiao's residence is here.

293
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,190
Are you having a good day today,

294
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,680
my dear lord?

295
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,910
Look.

296
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,960
This is how I looked the first time you saw me.

297
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,030
Do you remember?

298
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,550
The day after tomorrow is our wedding day.

299
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,720
Are you happy?

300
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,720
After the wedding,

301
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,579
I'll officially call you my husband.

302
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,220
Shouldn't you also change your stance,

303
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,140
and say you love me?

304
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,290
Don't worry.

305
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,220
As long as you say it to me,

306
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,760
I'll let you go.

307
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,440
This hot spring aids blood circulation.

308
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,690
The wounds on your body can't heal at all.

309
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,510
My heart aches seeing it too.

310
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,740
It must hurt so much.

311
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,380
You're still so shy.

312
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,460
You won't even open your eyes to look at me.

313
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,550
I can only play the old game we've been playing these few days.

314
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,850
If you don't answer,

315
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,490
I'll pretend to be angry

316
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,650
and give you a fierce stab.

317
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,220
Here we go.

318
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,040
Di Feisheng.

319
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,420
Do you love me?

320
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,450
Do you love me?

321
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,180
Do you?

322
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,660
Forget it.

323
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,750
We should change how we play this game.

324
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,030
Do you know Li Xiangyi is also locked here?

325
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,970
I knew you would be concerned

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,330
after hearing his name.

327
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,370
I will...

328
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,650
grant you death.

329
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,290
I can't believe you're doing this to me.

330
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,170
All the tendons in your limbs are severed.

331
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,300
You have no strength.

332
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,100
Yet you only think of killing me.

333
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,180
Granting me death...

334
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,780
Do you want me to die so badly?

335
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,500
Our wedding will happen the day after tomorrow.

336
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,190
After we exchange our vows,

337
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,070
even if you become a human swine,

338
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,000
you'll still be my husband.

339
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,800
Forever,

340
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,560
my husband.

341
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,290
Does this look good?

342
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,580
Li Xiangyi.

343
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,640
Of course Beauty Jiao looks good.

344
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,200
You can have her if you like.

345
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,940
But...

346
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,670
you don't look too good.

347
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,720
Don't tell me you're here

348
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,120
to say all this nonsense.

349
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
You're saving me unconditionally.

350
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,550
Aren't you afraid I'll attack you again after escaping?

351
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,350
Director Di.

352
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,780
Saying harsh things without meaning it,

353
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,840
you'd better save it for Jiao Liqiao.

354
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,380
Iâ€™ve been to Di Fortress.

355
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,310
You're working with Shan Gudao

356
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,510
only because you want to steal the Rama Vessel

357
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,340
to cure yourself of the mind control techniques.

358
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,760
But looking at you now...

359
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,150
I've always been a kind person,

360
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,180
and I deeply empathize with you.

361
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,310
Aren't you the same?

362
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,730
I asked Wuyan to look for you,

363
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,390
but you were captured and brought here.

364
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,220
Looks like Shan Gudao got his way.

365
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,640
Since both of us are in such a situation now,

366
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,570
let's save the spite at each other.

367
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,380
I killed the child bug of the Karmic Bug

368
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,070
using the snow salt that Wuyan gave.

369
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,330
But I didn't think that

370
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,490
Shan Gudao got the mother bug instead.

371
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,420
Let's not waste any more time talking,

372
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,820
and get out of here first.

373
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,450
Let's hide for a while first.

374
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,420
Hide where?

375
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,970
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

376
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,960
The newlywed room.

377
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,980
Newlywed room?

378
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,110
Your newlywed room.

379
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,900
Bad news!

380
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,540
The man Master caught has escaped.

381
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:14,980
Hurry!

382
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,240
Block all the exits!

383
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,350
After them!

384
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,060
You're starting to practice already?

385
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,790
There's no need for such a rush.

386
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,270
I'm rebuilding my meridians.

387
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Looks like I underestimated

388
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,430
your Windy Poplar.

389
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,120
Your Yangzhouman is proper and long-lasting,

390
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,060
but Windy Poplar seeks survival in dangerous situations.

391
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,790
We have different approaches.

392
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,210
When Jiao Liqiao got rid of my martial skills,

393
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,940
the Windy Poplar protected me,

394
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,930
and locked my internal power within my Sea of Qi.

395
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,810
That's why I still have a chance to try.

396
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,300
No wonder you could survive

397
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,880
after the battle at the East Sea.

398
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,240
My injury back then

399
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,280
was not as serious as it is now.

400
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,400
What about now?

401
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,850
It'll depend on my luck.

402
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,680
Odds of one to nine.

403
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,480
There's a 9 out of 10 probability

404
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,220
that I'll die.

405
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,540
If you die,

406
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,620
it would be a waste of me saving you.

407
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,670
Fine, whatever.

408
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,270
Treat it as me owing you a favor.

409
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,750
Fine.

410

I'll go see what kind of clothes there are.

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,480
you are so lucky.

You've won even though it was a 1-in-10 chance.

Congratulations.

You helped me just now.

I will pay you back.

427

I don't like to be indebted to people.

428
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,780
Don't say all this about paying back and what not,

429
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,910
it's tiring to hear.

I'm most afraid of returning favors.

If you really want to repay me,

433
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,610
don't ever challenge me to a fight in the future.

434
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,870
I don't need you to teach me how to repay you.

435

It seems to be today.

00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,920
You won't be able to escape.

508
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,110
Director Di,

509
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
of all people to provoke,

510
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,350
you chose to provoke her.

511
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,840
Even if you want to leave, it's hard.

512
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,550
Li Lianhua.

513
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,930
Do you think you don't have your share of traps here?

514
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,280
Look who this is.

515
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,590
Biqiu was the one who designed this formation for me.

516
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
What do you think?

517
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,310
The number one trap master of Sigu Sect.

518
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
Even Tianji Hall never had

519
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,930
such an entertaining trap formation.

520
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,060
Biqiu,

521
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,380
I like it very much.

522
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,820
Li Lianhua.

523
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,640
What a coincidence.

524
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,990
It was Yun Biqiu who brought you here

525
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,990
from Lotus Tower.

526
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,200
Now he will also help me to keep you from leaving.

527
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,790
Ten years ago,

528
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,490
it was him who used a cup of Bicha

529
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,340
to turn Li Xiangyi into Li Lianhua.

530
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,010
Now it'll also be him

531
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,180
to turn Li Lianhua into a lonely wandering ghost.

532
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,190
Saintess!

533
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,720
Saintess.

534
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,730
Bad news.

535
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,530
Qiao Wanmian and Fo, Bi, Bai, Shi

536
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,820
have led a large group of Sigu Sect disciples

537
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,020
and are already at the foot of the mountain.

538
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,500
What are you nervous about?

539
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,140
Biqiu.

540
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,450
Activate all the traps on the mountain,

541
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,220
and have them all come up to die.

542
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,730
Let's go.

543
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,460
Di Feisheng.

544
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,610
At this point,

545
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,430
you will need to choose between two options.

546
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,320
Will you choose to be my husband,

547
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,540
or to be a ghost with Li Xiangyi?

548
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,610
You'll be the one to be a ghost.

549
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,500
Director Di.

550
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,390
You really don't know how to treat ladies well.

551
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,890
Gang Leader Jiao is trying so hard to keep you,

552
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,420
but you're still so fierce.

553
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,140
You mean you know how to treat ladies well?

554
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,940
Go ahead then.

555
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,130
I dare not.

556
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,520
Di Feisheng.

557
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,920
You asked for it.

558
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,290
Don't touch it.

559
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,270
I caught him again.

560
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,990
Why don't we let him

561
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,940
stay enclosed in this metal tower,

562
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,780
so that I can control him forever?

563
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,820
It's not a bad idea

564
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,360
to let him be a zombie that won't budge.

565
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,420
Beauty Jiao.

566
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,580
You're joking around again.

567
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,800
This poisonous smoke has no effect on you.

568
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,190
I got away from the Bicha Poison already.

569
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,760
Other poisons

570
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,530
are nothing to me.

571
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,070
I thought this Bicha Poison couldn't do anything to you.

572
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,240
But you're just a paper tiger.

573
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,660
Then hurry up and die

574
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,560
to liven things up for me.

575
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,050
What's going on?

576
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,800
Sigu Sect is approaching fiercely.

577
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,780
The trap formations are all activated.

578
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,659
How did they get in?

579
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,520
We can't stop them at all.

580
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,290
You may leave.

581
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,659
Yes.

582
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,190
Useless!

583
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,260
You don't have the upper hand anymore.

584
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,230
Where is Li Lianhua?

585
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,960
Li Lianhua is waiting for you in the netherworld.

586
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,970
You still want to activate the traps?

587
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,960
It's too late.

588
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,040
Li Lianhua!

589
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,970
Li Lianhua!

590
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,690
The bullets are poisonous.

591
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,690
Don't touch them!

592
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,710
Jiao Liqiao.

593
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,230
Your Yulongniuma Gang has been wiped out.

594
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,890
Your plan has failed already.

595
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,710
Just give up.

596
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,700
Then I'll destroy this mountain

597
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,360
and let everyone die with me.

598
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,940
But Li Xiangyi,

599
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,060
you must die in my hands today.

600
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,310
[Freezing Sky and Closed Earth]

601
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,000
The mechanism is at the southeast of the mountain peak.

602
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,480
Seven-Dipper Formation is in the east,

603
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,990
and the Nine Changes of Heaven and Earth is in the west.

604
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,960
The mechanism's axis cuts through north to south.

605
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,690
In this case,

606
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,780
every section should have a trigger mechanism.

607
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,210
Eight steps east from the north corner of the building behind,

608
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,390
ten inches below the wall.

609
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,100
That's the weak point of all the traps.

610
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,270
We can destroy the traps by hitting that point.

611
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,070
Take Shaoshi!

612
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,560
Li Lianhua.

I know.

614
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,180
It's all your fault.

615
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,900
Li Xiangyi!

616
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,240
If I kill you...

617
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,030
If I kill you, no one else will

618
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,120
to get in the way of our relationship.

619
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,770
Leave first,

620
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,750
and leave things here to me.

621
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,060
I hate you.

622
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,800
Because you are hateful.

623
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,150
It has nothing to do with others.

624
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,460
Fine.

625
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,590
Since I can't keep you,

626
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,780
let's die together.

627

I don't kill women.

628
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:15,920
But you

629
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
are an exception.

630

Xiaobao.

631
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,660
You destroyed this trap, right?

632
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,370
Strange.

633
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,060
All the traps we encountered along the way,

634
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,830
all of the weak points are exposed.

635
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,630
It's obvious.

636
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,910
Logically speaking,

637
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,210
everyone who knows how to design traps

638
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,500
know that the mechanism should be hidden.

639
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,760
And this mechanism...

640
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,110
someone deliberately

641
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,290
wants to show it to others.

642
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,510
That's right.

643
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,950
Could it be...

647
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,710
I'm fine.

Shan Gudao is controlling my master with the Karmic Bug.

He has the palace under his control.

665

He also captured Princess Zhaoling,

00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,860
I told you the method behind

679
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,790
Windy Poplar's internal power.

680
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,480
Although I can't let you go back to how you used to be,

681
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,390
it can still temporarily protect your stamina and pulse.

682
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:11,990
Thank you.

683
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,200
â™«I'll fight with my swordâ™«

684
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,460
Director Di.

685
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,900
I didn't expect that...

686
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,860
â™«I enjoy the spring breeze against my swordâ™«

687
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,070
you would stay and help us this time.

688
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,460
I was right about you.

689
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,770
â™«Stop the carriage in the night forestâ™«

690
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,360
Iâ€™m not interested in helping others.

691
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,940
I just donâ€™t want Li Xiangyi to die here.

692
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,670
â™«Headed to Jiangnan on a lonely boatâ™«

693
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,470
Ten years ago, during the battle between Sigu Sect and Jinyuan Alliance,

694
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:34,330
â™«Yesterday I lit a lamp to light the four cornersâ™«

695
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,130
both sides suffered terrible losses.

696
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,140
â™«It doesn't dampen the noiseâ™«

697
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,980
Ten years later,

698
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,980
we are fighting together.

699
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,960
â™«Today we speak nonsense for ten yearsâ™«

700
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,070
Life is really interesting.

701
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,570
Of course I want the person behind the mess back then,

702
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,180
â™«Floating like flowers and grassâ™«

703
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,100
to pay with their blood.

704
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,500
â™«Every word and phraseâ™«

705
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,750
â™«Have the rules of the martial worldâ™«

706
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,290
â™«I thought making a name for myselfâ™«

707
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,240
â™«Was easyâ™«

708
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,490
â™«Grit your teeth and live onâ™«

709
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,730
â™«I must be invincible tomorrowâ™«

710
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,180
â™«The green mountains beyond, and the towers afarâ™«

711
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,370
â™«Cannot be compared to the birds singing in the willow treesâ™«

712
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,950
â™«A song on the spring river of the moonlit nightâ™«

713
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,390
â™«Discussing swordplay over wine deep in the bamboo forestâ™«

714
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,620
â™«Raise a toast to drown our deep sorrowsâ™«

715
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,470
â™«All our martial reputation are swept away with the oceanâ™«
