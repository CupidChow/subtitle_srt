[Episode 4]

3
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,000
Lately, great demons
have been stirring.

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,860
Even the Bone Nails
are showing signs of loosening.

5
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,479
There's really nothing to celebrate
on Danxia Land these days.

6
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,180
I was left with no other option,

[Fan Jiaojiao]

8
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,570
so I decided to get married myself.

9
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,009
But I didn't expect to accidentally
marry my own master's wife.

10
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,910
The one I was supposed to marry

11
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,880
was the sixth daughter
of the Liu family from Yunquan Cave.

12
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,079
Not only did I send the betrothal gifts,

13
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,150
I even gave them
several magical artifacts as compensation.

14
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,400
Her parents agreed without hesitation.

15
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
No idea what she was thinking,

16
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,870
but right before
the wedding, she ran off.

17
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,170
So you kidnapped my wife instead?

18
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,620
No.

19
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,540
Master, I'd never
even seen Miss Liu before.

20
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,560
It was pitch-black that night.

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,880
And your wife was all alone,
standing in the wilderness.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,690
I didn't see clearly.

23
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,220
I swear I didn't mean to.

24
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,120
How about

25
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,540
I apologize to her again?

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,680
Master?

27
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
So…

28
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,440
it's another coincidence?

29
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,230
What?

30
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,780
Do you believe you took her

31
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,810
by chance?

32
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,670
Master, I never meant it.

33
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,350
Please don't misunderstand.

34
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,430
All by chance?

35
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,670
Heavenly Lord.

36
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,630
My Lady.

37
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,270
His Lordship sent me to take you
to Yuewu House for some rest.

38
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,670
Where is Yuewu House?

39
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,490
It's within Canglei Palace, of course.

40
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,150
His Lordship said you may
live there from now on.

41
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't need to return to Tianmu Peak?

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,410
Yes. He said your magic is too weak,

43
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,240
and living alone could be dangerous.

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,970
So he's making an exception
and letting you stay at Canglei Palace.

45
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,400
Where is His Lordship?

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,070
He's busy. He asked me to lead the way.

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Is he mad at me
and doesn't want to see me?

48
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,330
Ah, right.
Fan Jiaojiao was rude to you earlier.

49
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,310
You must have been scared.

50
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,870
Later,

51
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,920
I'll have him personally
bring you a calming tonic.

52
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,980
It'll help you sleep better tonight.

53
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,280
Don't bother. I'm fine.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,040
But this groom called Fan Jiaojiao

55
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
is a bit clueless.

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,300
He actually mistook me for his bride.

57
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,010
His Lordship must be furious that
I took vows with someone else.

58
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,190
It's not entirely Fan Jiaojiao's fault.

59
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,850
He holds a wedding every year.

60
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,050
Anyone could make a mistake like that.

61
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,900
Every year?

62
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't tell me he kidnaps all his brides.

63
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,650
Don't worry, My Lady.

64
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,800
Even though Hell Ruins
houses many vicious demons,

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
it's not some lawless place.

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
No marriage is forced.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,160
Nothing unscrupulous.

68
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,640
Then Immortal Lord Fan must be so charming

69
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
to have so many women
lining up to marry him.

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,630
Fan Jiaojiao is one of His Lordship's

71
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,930
Three Dharma Lords.

72
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
He oversees the Nailers—

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,510
people tasked with
subduing demonic beasts.

74
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,120
Most demonic beasts are feral,
vicious, and hard to tame.

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,460
Being sealed here

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,580
only builds up their resentment.

77
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,830
Immortal Lord Fan is a master artificer.

78
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,630
The Bone Nails he forges draw on
heaven's energy and water's essence—

79
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,090
perfect for
suppressing their resentment.

80
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,970
But over time, the nails loosen.

81
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,600
So...

82
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
So he has to get married?

83
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,270
Yes.

84
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,360
The resentment is dissolved through joy.

85
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,750
And weddings provide

86
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,210
the Nailers with that joy.

87
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,270
Food at the wedding

88
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,270
is a steady source of energy for them.

89
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,040
So far,

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,120
Hell Ruins has been

91
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,830
peaceful for over 100 years.

92
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,540
This yard is called Tongyou Yard.

93
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,870
It has nine winding paths
and hidden towers among the clouds.

94
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,560
It's the heart of Canglei Palace.

95
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,270
The yard has nine exits,

96
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,520
each leading to a different corridor.

97
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,100
Due east
connects to Canglei Palace's gate.

98
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,800
Due west leads to Hell Ruins,
where demonic beasts are sealed.

99
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Due north is the Chongwu Hall, where
His Lordship handles official matters.

100
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,750
From right to left,

101
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,600
the other exits lead to the domains
of the Three Dharma Lords.

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,480
Of course, My Lady,
there's no need for you to know all that.

103
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,600
Then what should I know?

104
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,600
Naturally, your sleeping quarters
and His Lordship's.

105
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,180
Where we came from just now
is Linyuan Pavilion.

106
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,400
That's His Lordship's residence.

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,140
Your residence
is in the opposite direction.

108
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,100
It's just ahead.

109
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,790
Ah, your quarters are a bit secluded,

110
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,350
close to Hell Ruins.

111
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,680
So don't wander around at night.

112
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,040
You might run into something unexpected.

113
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,330
You mean demonic beasts?

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
You might run into
Fan Jiaojiao holding another wedding.

115
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,380
You just mentioned

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,060
His Lordship has Three Dharma Lords.

117
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,000
I've only met Immortal Lord Fan so far.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,080
Who are the other two?

119
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,830
Are they also in Canglei Palace?

120
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,090
That's a long story for such a short walk.

121
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,290
You'll know them when you meet them.

122
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Lady Qingyue, we've arrived.

123
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,870
From now on,
you'll be staying in Yuewu House.

124
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,000
Let me know if you need anything.

[Yin Tongzi]

145
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,960
Who are you, kid?
Why are you in my room?

146
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,620
Can you tell stories?

147
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,350
I don't tell stories.

148
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,380
It's late. Go home, kid.

149
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,810
How about I tell you a story?

150
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,850
You'll leave after that?

151
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,410
Fine. Go ahead.

152
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,720
Once upon a time,

153
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,720
there was a not-so-special girl
in a second-rate sect

154
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,910
in the mortal realm.

155
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,910
But she got lucky—

156
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,730
she married a powerful
and influential man.

157
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,500
But as soon as she got married,

158
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,750
her husband

159
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,750
cast her off to some remote mountain

160
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,220
and never visited her.

161
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,010
She went through hell,

162
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,510
barely survived,

163
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,510
and finally met her husband.

164
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,040
But her husband was cold as ice.

165
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,240
Even when someone else tried to marry her,

166
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,580
he didn't care at all.

167
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,910
He didn't even want to see her!

168
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,740
Shut up if you don't know
how to tell stories.

169
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,800
That's not true.

170
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,940
But she still loved her husband very much.

171
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,720
And then,

172
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,190
she was sent by an old man to Yuewu House.

173
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
She opened the wardrobe
and found a little boy inside.

174
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,910
The boy wanted to tell her a story.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,080
A story about counting heads.

176
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,220
Count how many heads are in the room.

177
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,320
Once the counting's done,

178
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,300
the boy will eat her whole in one bite.

179
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,030
One.

180
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,390
Two.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,230
What's going on?

182
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,630
Help!

183
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,870
My Lady, apologies for the fright.

184
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,840
Ning Yan.

185
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,960
Thank goodness you're here.

186
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,340
Don't be afraid, My Lady.
He's just a little demon.

187
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,020
A demon?

188
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,120
That boy is a demon?

189
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,480
What demon is he?

190
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,870
He's called Yin Tongzi,

191
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,000
a vicious demon that feeds on human heads.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,690
He was locked up
in Canglei Palace by His Lordship

193
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,960
but snuck out later.

194
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,010
Unfortunately, before he could
get a bite of anything warm,

195
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,140
he got caught again.

196
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,340
If you run into him again,
just punch him in the face.

197
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,140
Like I could beat him.

198
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,580
Then just cover your ears and ignore him.

199
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,740
That simple?

200
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,260
Didn't you say you were bound
by the Binding Spell

201
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,470
and couldn't leave Tianmu Peak?

202
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,720
How did you get here?

203
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,280
Immortal Lord Cang Tu brought me here.

204
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,260
He also said

205
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,030
you don't need
to return to Tianmu Peak anymore.

206
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,890
You'll be living here from now on.

207
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm here to protect you.

208
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,470
It's getting late.

209
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,910
You should rest, My Lady.

210
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,550
My Lady.

211
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,390
My Lady.

212
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
Do I look good?

213
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,180
Why are you drawing on your face?

214
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,140
I'm filling in my brows, not drawing.

215
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
Then why are your lips bleeding?

216
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,330
It's not blood. It's lip rouge.

217
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,870
My lips are pale
from my weak constitution,

218
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,680
so I need a bit of red to look good.

219
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,560
Want to try it?

220
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,710
I'll pass.

221
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,760
Have you ever worn rouge before?

222
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,440
No.

223
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,200
I've devoted myself
to cultivation since childhood.

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,060
I've never used things like that.

225
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,880
Then you have to try it.

226
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,480
I promise you'll love it.

227
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,840
You've dressed up so beautifully.

228
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,200
You must be going
to see His Lordship, right?

229
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,840
Yes.

230
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,710
Then you'd better hurry.

231
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,000
At this hour,

232
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,240
he's just finished the morning meeting.

233
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,680
If you delay any longer,
you might miss him.

234
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,420
You're right.

235
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll get going then.

236
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,210
What a terrifying thing.

237
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,920
Who are you?

238
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,710
Li Qingyue.

239
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,140
[Supreme Gatekeeper]

240
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,510
Heavenly Lady?

241
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,510
[Grand Gatekeeper]

242
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,770
Is His Lordship inside?

243
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,870
Yes.

244
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,470
Good.

245
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,580
My Lady, let me
announce your arrival first.

246
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,300
Wait.

247
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,030
You're too young. Not mature enough.

248
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,480
My Lady, I'll go.

249
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,600
You?

250
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,810
Look at your old face.

251
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,030
You smile with wrinkles
all over your face.

252
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,560
You may scare His Lordship.

253
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,240
Old? So what?

254
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,810
At least I'm not short.

255
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,870
If I don't look down,
I can't even see you.

256
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,670
You know that?

257
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
So what?

258
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,210
I'm talented.

259
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,910
I formed
my golden core at eight years old.

260
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,020
I can stay young forever.

261
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,270
Unlike me,
you didn't form your golden core until 80.

262
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,930
But I had a major breakthrough
in my later years.

263
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,270
My magic is now three levels above yours.

264
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,070
You know that?

265
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll go.

266
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,210
Is that so?

267
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,150
Excuse me.

268
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,120
Old man.

269
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,630
Wait. I'm warning you.

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,130
Don't you dare call me an old man again.

271
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,620
Old man.

272
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,560
Bring it on.

273
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,080
My Lord.

274
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,520
Those two guards
are still fighting outside.

275
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,180
It really doesn't look great.

276
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,980
Why don't we transfer them back

277
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,250
to guard the gate of Canglei Palace?

278
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,610
Let them be. I like the noise.

279
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,340
But as long as they're here,

280
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,180
Her Ladyship won't be able to come in.

281
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,810
All the better.

282
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,780
Let me see how badly she wants to see me.

283
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,290
Uh, stop fighting, okay?

284
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,200
I won't see His Lordship.

285
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,930
This has nothing to do with you.

286
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,819
I'm here to see His Lordship.

287
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,109
What are you looking at?

288
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,440
Can't I look at you?

289
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,319
You wanna get beaten again?

290
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,410
An old man like you

291
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,790
never gets to beat me!

292
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,109
Old man!

293
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,880
Old man!

294
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,940
Shorty!

295
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,780
Shorty!

296
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,320
My Lady, you didn't
get to see His Lordship again?

297
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,470
Are you hungry? Want a peach?

298
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,890
I feel like His Lordship
might be mad at me.

299
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,790
It's not a feeling. He's definitely mad.

300
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,150
I knew it.

301
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,480
No normal man

302
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,550
would stay calm

303
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,250
after watching
his wife marry someone else.

304
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,010
But he won't even see me now.

305
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,790
What can I do to make him forgive me?

306
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,570
Well...

307
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,530
I don't really get romance stuff.

308
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,460
I don't want to give you bad advice.

309
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,510
This is my first time getting married.

310
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,110
I have no experience either.

311
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,670
Get out!

312
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,850
No.

313
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,960
Can you tell stories?

314
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,920
Let me tell you a story.

315
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,610
Once upon a time,

316
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,200
there was a woman despised by her husband.

317
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,630
Ning Yan!

318
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,820
Someone's hitting a kid! Help!

319
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,030
Someone's hitting a kid! Help!

320
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,730
[Dear, you linger long in my heart.
Though I do not go to you, could you not send word to me?]

321
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,870
Nice handwriting.

322
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,680
Indeed.

323
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,590
Let me tell you.

324
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,390
This is exactly
the kind of stuff Master falls for.

325
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,810
[Dear, you linger long in my heart.
Though I do not go to you, could you not send word to me?]

326
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,610
[Dear, you linger long in my heart.
Though I do not go to you, could you not send word to me?]

327
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,190
Her Ladyship is quite romantic.

328
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,440
[I can't forget you since I met you.
I miss you like mad if I can't see you. -Li Qingyue]

329
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,400
[I can't forget you since I met you.
I miss you like mad if I can't see you. -Li Qingyue]

330
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,310
Her Ladyship

331
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,330
really loves His Lordship deeply.

332
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,090
Yes.

333
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,520
His Lordship
must be pleased on the inside.

334
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,480
Once upon a time, a little boy

335
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,880
was locked up in a yard.

336
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,440
He ate peaches every day.

337
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,330
Then, the boy started telling his story.

338
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,860
Count how many peaches are on the table.

339
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,110
Once he finishes counting,

340
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,340
he will eat them in one bite.

341
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,310
One.

342
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,680
Two.

343
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,920
Three.

344
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,070
Four.

345
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,790
Five.

346
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,920
Six.

347
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,350
What's wrong? You want to hear a story?

348
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,290
Let me tell one instead.

349
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,000
A guy from the Li family fell hopelessly
in love with a girl from the Wei family.

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,310
He thought about her day and night.

351
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,120
So he wrote her several love poems
and had them delivered to her.

352
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,400
Miss Wei was touched by his love poems.

353
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
So...

354
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,750
What's wrong?

355
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,490
Heavenly Lord!

356
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,550
Stop reading that kind of nonsense.

357
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,210
Heavenly Lord!

358
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,200
Heavenly Lord!

359
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,160
Heavenly Lord? Heavenly Lord!

360
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,510
My Lady, your romance books
are so helpful.

361
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,910
His Lordship actually came to you himself!

362
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,080
Of course!

363
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
He was so shy

364
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,050
that he even burned my book.

365
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,550
That's too bad.

366
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,550
How will you know what to do next?

367
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,520
It's fine.

368
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,400
I've memorized

369
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,920
everything in it.

370
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,840
I'll just keep doing

371
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,300
what the book says.

372
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,910
Who told you
to climb in through the window?

373
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,530
I came for a secret midnight rendezvous.

374
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,950
I thought you knew you couldn't beat me,

375
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,370
so you tried to scare me to death instead.

376
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,430
If you don't like it,

377
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,110
I won't wear makeup next time.

378
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,230
You're not still mad, are you?

379
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,110
I'm not mad.

380
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,480
You don't have to lie.

381
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,880
I understand.

382
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,350
If you held a wedding with another woman,

383
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,950
I'd be mad for a long time too.

384
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,560
That's why you came to see me?

385
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,830
Come on, Heavenly Lord.

386
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,400
Forgive me, will you?

387
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
Didn't I tell you to stop reading

388
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,970
that ridiculous stuff?

389
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,160
The books say this is how you apologize.

390
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,590
You…

391
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,510
No apology is needed.

392
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,140
I'm not mad.

393
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,310
The books also say when couples fight,
they mean the opposite

394
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,830
of what they say.

395
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,110
Mention those books again
and see what happens.

396
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,550
Okay, okay. I won't.

397
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,920
Tell me. What else?

398
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,630
Actually, I want you to teach me magic.

399
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,440
You want me to teach you?

400
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,980
Why?

401
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,790
Because I don't want
to keep being a burden to you.

402
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,610
You already have so much on your plate.

403
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,510
I don't want to be someone

404
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,240
you always have to rescue.

405
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,230
We're husband and wife.

406
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,040
I can't keep dragging you down.

407
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,890
That's the only reason?

408
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,840
I heard that you live
as long as the sun and moon.

409
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,170
But my magic is too weak.

410
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,500
One day, I'll grow old, get sick, and die.

411
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,720
If I could improve my magic,

412
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,070
maybe I could stay by your side

413
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,310
a little longer.

414
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,940
Come find me tomorrow.
I'll teach you magic.

415
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,240
Even though you agreed to teach me,

416
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,240
I still think you're holding onto

417
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,960
some resentment

418
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,830
about that whole wedding thing.

419
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,220
How about this?

420
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,220
Kiss me,

421
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,610
and I'll believe you're not mad anymore.

422
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,260
Look, he's shy.

423
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,850
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

424
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,890
Rise.

425
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,190
I know your magic is weak,

426
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,310
but I didn't expect it to be so weak.

427
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,980
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

428
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,770
Rise.

429
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,660
Heavenly Lord, I conjured fire!

430
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,550
Look, Heavenly Lord.

431
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,860
Heavenly Lord.

432
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,480
Look.

433
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,310
It's gone.

434
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,720
Gone?

435
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,110
This is the Blazing Fire.

436
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,480
Heavenly Lord, you're amazing.

437
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,860
Rise.

438
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,750
It's fire.

439
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,080
Ning Yan, look.

440
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,680
Ning Yan, I did it!

441
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,870
No, My Lady.

442
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,880
I'm afraid of fire.

443
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,640
I'm afraid of it.

444
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,790
Take a look.

445
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,400
No, My Lady.

446
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,590
Yin Tongzi!

447
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,790
Yin Tongzi!

448
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,720
What? Do you want to hear a story?

449
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,070
No.

450
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,250
I'm not listening.

451
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,350
I'm not listening.

452
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,710
I saw it clearly today.

453
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,870
The fire magic Her Ladyship uses

454
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,650
isn't the Fire-Parting Technique
mastered by Divine Lord Siling.

455
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,960
I took that magic from her.

456
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,210
But when she saw it again today,

457
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,530
she wasn't angered at all.

458
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:11,530

My Lady, have some peaches.

465
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,200
We've been eating peaches
for a whole month now.

466
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,530
Aren't you sick of them?

467
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,440
Not at all.

468
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,790
They're delicious.

469
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,200
I've been eating them for centuries.

470
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,160
Look, the boy loves them too.

471
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,480
Count how many peaches are on the table.

472
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,500
Isn't there anywhere here

473
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,160
even remotely like a kitchen?

474
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,510
No one in Canglei Palace
eats or cooks.

475
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,380
Of course there's no kitchen.

476
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
Immortals really do live differently.

477
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,960
My Lady, His Lordship treats you so well.

478
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,240
If you ask him for a kitchen,

479
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,770
I'm sure he'll say yes.

480
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,610
You think so?

481
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,650
Definitely!

482
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,440
No.

483
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,030
Why not?

484
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,480
No reason.

485
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,230
If I beat you in Go,

486
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,960
will you give me a kitchen?

487
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,790
You?

488
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,480
Me.

489
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,760
All right.

490
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,390
Should I put it here?

491
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,510
Can't you see my pieces

492
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,830
have surrounded yours?

493
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,730
Yeah.

494
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,770
I'll put it somewhere else.

495
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,210
How about here?

496
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,350
What do you think?

497
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,210
It probably doesn't work.

498
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,680
Let me think about it.

499
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,070
Do you know how to play Go or not?

500
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,880
I do.

501
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,830
I used to play with
Senior Zhang Suan at Jingyun Sect.

502
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,920
I never lost once.

503
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,270
Why do I keep losing to you?

504
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,670
Are you seriously
comparing me to a mortal?

505
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,800
Sorry, my bad.

506
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,200
You're the best.

507
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,820
Heavenly Lord,

508
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,780
in the mortal realm,
we say you should eat what you lack.

509
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,170
And since I'm so bad at chess,

510
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,750
I must be lacking
brain-nourishing, protein-rich food.

511
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,300
If I had some hickory nuts,

512
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,659
fish, roasted pork, and stuff like that,

513
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,320
maybe I'd improve a little.

514
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,590
Then eat them.

515
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,239
Hickory nuts are easy to find.

516
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,610
But fish and pork…

517
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,070
Even if I had the ingredients,

518
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,880
they'd need to be cooked first.

519
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,190
You're right.

520
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,840
If I could
build a kitchen in this courtyard

521
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,219
and stock it with flour, oil, and grains,

522
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,400
I could cook regularly

523
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,510
and even bring you a dish or two.

524
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,840
Whatever.

525
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,760
So you're saying yes?

526
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,710
You lost.

527
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,590
I already lost?

528
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,220
What about my kitchen?

529
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,800
My Lord.

530
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Miss Ling'er is back.

531
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,720
That's enough for today.

532
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,880
You may go.

533
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,030
Who's Miss Ling'er?

534
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,550
His Lordship actually
has to receive her personally.

535
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,760
I didn't fail my mission.

536
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,190
The cracks in the Zhuri Sword
have all been mended.

537
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,400
I placed it in a yang-infused place
to absorb the sun's energy.

538
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,960
After 81 days, it will be fully restored,

539
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,510
[Fan Ling'er]

540
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,920
and its divine power will return.

541
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,480
Well done.

542
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,720
Seems Miss Ling'er's trip
to the mortal realm

543
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,150
has made her even more capable.

544
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,590
Of course.

545
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,440
She's my daughter after all.

546
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,400
Miss Ling'er,

547
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,040
I missed you terribly while you were gone.

548
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,110
His Lordship thinks
I'm not as considerate as you,

549
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,070
and your father wouldn't listen to me.

550
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,320
Now that you're back,

551
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,590
you'd better stay a while.

552
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,360
That depends on
His Lordship's arrangements.

553
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,360
Then stay here
in Canglei Palace for a while.

554
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,020
No need to leave again.

555
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,230
-Thank you, Master.
-Thank you, My Lord.

556
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,190
Heavenly Lord, are you in?

557
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,000
Hello, My Lady.

558
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:26,970
You...

559
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,080
Let me introduce you.

560
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,140
This is His Lordship's newlywed wife,

561
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,850
Li Qingyue from Jingyun Sect.

562
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,760
This is Immortal Lord Fan,

563
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,080
one of the Three Dharma Lords.

564
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,420
You already know him.

565
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,980
This is his daughter.

566
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,420
You can call her Ling'er.

567
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,820
She's been working for His Lordship
for almost 200 years now.

568
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,390
I was worried His Lordship
might get thirsty during the meeting,

569
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,590
so I brought some tea.

570
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,760
If you're discussing important matters,

571
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,710
I won't intrude.

572
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,490
Steward Cang,
could you please take it in for me?

573
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,110
Let her in.

574
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,760
It's okay.

575
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,840
Come on up.

576
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,410
Didn't you want to see me?

577
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,210
Why so quiet now?

578
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,440
I brought you tea.

579
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,590
Enjoy it.

580
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,270
Isn't this the teapot
from Linyuan Pavilion?

581
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,920
Yes.

582
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,280
Why is it cold?

583
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800
It's meant to be cold.

584
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,960
What are you really here for?

585
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,650
I just wanted to see

586
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
the girl who could
get a personal welcome from you.

587
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,000
I didn't welcome her.

588
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,190
She returned
to report on official matters.

589
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,180
You don't need to explain
such trivial things to me.

590
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,530
I wasn't explaining.

591
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,670
I get it.

592
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,620
Wait a moment.

593
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,440
I'll go get some hot tea for you.

594
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,690
So this was the surprise
you prepared for me?

595
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,700
Be patient. There's more.

596
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,320
Come with me.

597
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,440
Come.

598
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,110
Ling'er,

599
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,630
it's not ladylike for you to wield swords

600
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,280
and fight.

601
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,070
You should learn
to be gentle and virtuous.

602
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,000
Look.

603
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,480
Later, get changed,

604
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,550
comb your hair, and wear more hairpins.

605
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm a Dharma Lord.

606
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,750
Very rich.

607
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,980
I don't know how to spend all my money.

608
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,420
So help me out a bit,

609
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,590
won't you?

610
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,570
If you're really that rich,

611
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,280
why not buy some dresses and jewelry

612
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,840
for the Heavenly Lady?

613
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,230
She may put in a good word for you

614
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,280
with His Lordship.

615
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,610
So you already know.

616
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,110
Why didn't you
tell me His Lordship got married?

617
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,790
It all happened so suddenly.

618
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,570
I only found out after the fact.

619
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,290
And with the inexplicable turbulence
in Hell Ruins lately,

620
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,180
I've been swamped, and it slipped

621
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:31,800
my mind.

622
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,710
It slipped my mind.

623
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,910
Did it slip your mind,
or did you keep it from me on purpose?

624
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,400
It's a done deal now.

625
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,140
What difference does it make?

626
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,190
Ling'er.

627
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,320
Ling'er.

628
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,000
I took a quick glance
at her today at the hall.

629
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,590
From her face alone,

630
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,070
I knew why His Lordship married her.

631
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,480
To look that much like her

632
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,970
is a skill in itself.

633
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,490
I lost, and I accept it.

634
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:02,840
Go.

635
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,400
Kill her.
