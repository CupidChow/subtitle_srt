[Episode 25]

3
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,690
Without love, where does hatred come from?

4
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,479
I don't want to hear you
talk about this nonsense.

5
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,039
Get out.

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,040
How about you listen to my story instead?

7
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,730
I once fell in love with a man.

8
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,370
He was also very nice to me.

9
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,050
Unfortunately, I was young
and didn't understand love.

10
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,850
I... was always trying to hurt him

11
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,960
just to test his feelings for me.

12
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,640
I left him battered and bruised.

13
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,870
In the end, he chose to leave.

14
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,630
Actually, he loved me very much,
and I loved him too.

15
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,970
It was when I finally realized this

16
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,720
that I went to find him again,

17
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,800
only to find he had already passed away.

18
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
In heaven and on earth,

19
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,480
I could never find someone like him again.

20
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,340
So...

21
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,220
Whatever the issue is, we should sit down
and talk it through.

22
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,310
When NÃ¼wa created humans,

23
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,080
the reason why she created a mouth

24
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,630
was precisely for this.

25
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,150
If I remember correctly,

26
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,520
you previously said that you liked someone

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
but he was a scoundrel

28
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,780
who gave away everything you had given him.

29
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,270
You stormed off in a rage.

30
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,270
Is that so?

31
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,560
Did I ever say that?

32
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,850
Y-You might have remembered it wrongly.

33
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,530
My dear disciple.

34
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,840
Do you know why I like to drink?

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
Have another story to share?

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,030
Yes.

37
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,890
I'm actually rather timid.

38
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,030
I fell in love with someone
but didn't dare to tell him.

39
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,740
I only dared to secretly leave

40
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,540
a bouquet of flowers at his doorstep
every few days.

41
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,140
I have picked all the flowers here

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,480
on Yufan Mountain at least once.

43
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,070
From then on, I wandered everywhere,

44
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,829
leaving new flowers at his door
whenever I found them.

45
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,060
I drank all day,

46
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,870
with hopes that after drinking,

47
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,450
I might become a bit braver.

48
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,000
So that the next time I see him,

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
I'll tell him I like him.

50
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:42,760
Unfortunately, I am uniquely gifted.

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,140
The more I drink, the more sober I become.

52
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,290
It didn't help me build courage at all.

53
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,060
Is this a true story?

54
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,690
This story is also fake.

55
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,750
My dear disciple,

56
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,430
don't learn from your Master.

57
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,890
What's the use of having a mouth

58
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,800
if you can't speak what's on your mind?

59
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,940
Bai Jiusi.

60
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,020
Why haven't you

61
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,159
come to find me yet?

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,340
Only I could've done it.

63
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,950
If it were someone else,

64
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,410
you might end up empty-handed.

65
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,490
These two, one human and one immortal,

66
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,850
perished six hundred years ago.

67
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,380
My Lord, why are you looking for them now?

68
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,360
Six hundred years ago?

69
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,210
Yes.

70
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,310
On the same day, in fact.

71
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,280
Do you know which day it was?

72
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,200
It was...

73
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,760
during the battle when Lord Qing Xu
besieged the Lei Bird.

74
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,980
Many were killed and injured.

75
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,000
They were among them.

76
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,980
So people and immortals
who perished 600 years ago

77
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,240
couldn't then have appeared
400 years ago.

78
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,310
Of course.

79
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,600
When immortals perish, they
completely vanish in the universe.

80
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,820
And even if mortals reincarnate,

81
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,190
they won't be the same person anymore.

82
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,210
[Prosperity]

83
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,560
Grandmaster, this Nightmare Flower is not
from the mortal realm.

84
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
I, your disciple, am ignorant
and inexperienced.

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,120
I truly cannot find a way to detoxify.

86
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,560
[Prosperity]

87
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,750
After all, it was I who brought it here.

88
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,270
Why don't I take Miss Ling'er

89
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,190
back to Canglei Palace to find
Immortal Lord Fan?

90
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,950
You were the one who got away before.

91
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,120
If you go back now, Long Yuan will
surely not let you off easily.

92
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,240
Well, he can punish me if he wants,

93
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,770
but he won't take my life...

94
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,160
right?

95
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,750
Where's Xuan Wei?

96
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,680
He seemed to have been called away
for something.

97
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,740
Is Grandmaster aware that you are
going to Canglei Palace?

98
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
Master, the situation is urgent.

99
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't have time to ask for her permission.

100
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,870
Master, I'm sure you don't want to see Qing...

101
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,360
No.

102
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,950
I'm sure you don't want to see Grandmaster

103
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,610
put herself in danger, right?

104
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,960
The reason I came to you

105
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,870
is because I feel...

106
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,320
you understand that I'm being serious.

107
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
The other seniors...

108
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,150
all just think I'm causing trouble.

109
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,179
But...

110
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,790
Your skills are no match for Canglei Palace.

111
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,380
Master, you don't need to worry
about my safety.

112
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,510
Previously, when Canglei Palace
punished Jingyun Sect,

113
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,840
weren't we given five days as well?

114
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,120
That shows...

115
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,100
the immortals of Nine Heavens
may not be entirely unreasonable.

116
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,410
Master, you must know best

117
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,970
about the grudge between her
and Heavenly Lord Dacheng, right?

118
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,030
All the more reason for you not to go.

119
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,120
No.

120
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,060
Grandmaster has already told me

121
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,940
all her stories right down

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,330
to the smallest detail.

123
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,480
Master, you're a man,

124
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,950
so you won't understand.

125
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
Sometimes...

126
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
if a person can tell their story

127
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,080
to a not-so-important friend,

128
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,030
that means she has already let it go.

129
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,080
At this time,

130
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,550
she doesn't need someone backing her up,

131
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,120
but a mediator to help them reconcile.

132
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,480
Moreover, all of you

133
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,740
have had conflicts with Canglei Palace.

134
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,460
So I'm the most suitable person for this.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Also...

136
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,820
I think the grudge between her
and Heavenly Lord Dacheng

137
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,090
might not be beyond reconciliation.

138
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,200
This Heavenly Lord Dacheng

139
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,390
may not be as cold-hearted as
she had described.

140
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,210
Master.

141
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,960
I know what you care about most
is her safety.

142
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,420
Then all the more you should agree
to my plan.

143
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,240
If I can resolve their grudge,

144
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,910
then Canglei Palace and Jingyun Sect

145
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,020
can coexist peacefully, right?

146
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Master, trust me this once.

147
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,550
Since Grandmaster has told you
everything about her past,

148
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,630
it means she trusts you.

149
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,490
Therefore, I trust you too.

150
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,080
Thank you.

151
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,960
Before I return,

152
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,830
please don't tell Grandmaster.

153
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,440
Qing Yang.

154
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,030
Be careful in everything you do.

155
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,120
If anything happens, just come back.

156
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't push yourself too hard.

157
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
I understand.

158
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,800
Oh, right.

159
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,420
Master, do you have any favorite flowers?

160
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,190
I don't like flowers.

161
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,620
Dandelions are not bad though.

162
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,940
I see.

163
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,660
Can you just stop already?

164
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,060
Haven't I already shown you
what you wanted to see?

165
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,590
Why did you summon me again?

166
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,350
I want to see it again.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,390
The 10 years when I sealed Ruyue's powers.

168
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,230
I want to see it again.

169
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,630
Are you so shaken that

170
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,890
you've lost your mind?

171
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,190
Why are you torturing yourself?

172
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm very clear-headed.

173
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,370
Clearer than ever before.

174
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,870
Who are you?

175
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,380
It's a mortal.

176
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,080
Should I also take a bow here
in the divine realm?

177
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,030
Cut the act.

178
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
What's your name?

179
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,630
How did you get up here?

180
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,830
What are you here for?

181
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,650
I'm an elder of Jingyun Sect.

182
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,310
I've come specifically to pay my respects
to Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

183
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,750
It's Heavenly Lord Dacheng!

184
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,790
Jingyun Sect?

185
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,120
The sect established by Siling.

186
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,690
Wait, wait.

187
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,870
Who are you two?

188
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,630
I am the Gate-guarding Marshal.

189
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,270
I am the Gate-guarding General.

190
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,240
He's my Senior.

191
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,100
He's my Junior.

192
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,370
Your gestures...

193
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,670
Don't misunderstand.

194
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,790
I'm here on behalf of Jingyun Sect
to seek reconciliation.

195
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,870
Could you please inform
Heavenly Lord Dacheng for me?

196
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,390
Too troublesome, not our business.

197
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,840
At least put in a good word for me.

198
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,360
No.

199
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm Li Qingyue's Master.

200
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,600
By order of rank and relation,

201
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,900
Heavenly Lord Dacheng
should also call me Master.

202
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,010
He will definitely see me.

203
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,070
Wait a moment.

204
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,970
Someone from Jingyun Sect has intruded here.

205
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,340
Such audacity.

206
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,510
Showing up here on their own?

207
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,790
Master is away and hasn't returned.

208
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,840
I'll go meet her.

209
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,870
Remember,

210
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,150
don't tell anyone that someone
from Jingyun Sect was here.

211
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,240
Yes, Senior.

212
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,790
So you're from Jingyun Sect.

213
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,790
You're Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

214
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,760
What do you want with my Master?

215
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,030
Heavenly Lord Dacheng is your Master?

216
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,390
You see.

217
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,200
Your Master, Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

218
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,960
and my disciple Qingyue,

219
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
have a tiny misunderstanding.

220
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,390
I want to explain on their behalf.

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,130
Misunderstanding?

222
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,910
If that's the case, then come with me.

223
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,570
Where are we going?

224
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,210
Wait, wait for me!

225
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,610
Where were you this morning?

226
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,220
Qing Yang had doubts about her cultivation.

227
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,960
She was afraid of being scolded
by Zi Yang and others,

228
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,620
so she came to see me secretly.

229
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,080
I have been puzzled about
something these days, Master.

230
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,690
Since we returned,

231
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,670
I noticed that you only ordered
the sect to rest,

232
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,960
without making any further plans.

233
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,000
Perhaps you've let go of everything, Master?

234
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Or have you forgotten past grievances?

235
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,240
The grievances still exist.

236
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,640
There are simply more things now
that even I can't figure out.

237
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,920
Master, please feel free to share.

238
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,880
[Mercy Over All]

239
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,850
Perhaps I can offer you some clarity.

240
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,160
I just suddenly realized

241
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,720
that in the grand scheme of things,

242
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,790
it seems like there's an invisible hand

243
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,190
constantly pushing Bai Jiusi and me apart.

244
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,990
Why do you have such thoughts, Master?

245
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,390
In the past, I was consumed by hatred
and couldn't escape it.

246
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,790
Now that I think about it,

247
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,690
the appearance of this book is
far too much of a coincidence.

248
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,080
The wandering immortal who
gave me this book

249
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,270
disappeared after fleeing
and never showed up again.

250
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,630
I can use most of the magical artifacts

251
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,760
listed inside here.

252
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,069
It's as if it was tailor-made for me.

253
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,900
Master, are you suggesting that someone

254
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,410
deliberately gave you this book?

255
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,930
It's just a suspicion of mine.

256
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,240
But failing to kill Bai Jiusi this time

257
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,250
led to an unexpected discovery.

258
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,980
I'm not the only one who
wants to kill Bai Jiusi.

259
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,760
That's why this book appeared.

260
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,349
After all, the magical artifacts inside

261
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:35,330
can all help me deal with Bai Jiusi.

262
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,920
Can't say I've heard of that.

263
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,880
Who else could have a grudge against
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

264
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,590
Indeed.

265
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,350
It's precisely because I can't figure out

266
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,480
why would others want to kill Bai Jiusi

267
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,220
that I've been bewildered all this time.

268
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,480
I don't mind others asking me to team up

269
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,540
against Bai Jiusi.

270
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,970
But I don't want to be used either.

271
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,700
If such a person really exists,

272
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,240
then you must be careful, Master.

273
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,160
I don't care what tricks you used
to get in here,

274
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,490
but you can forget about seeing my Master.

275
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,980
I'm here to seek peace,
not to cause trouble.

276
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,080
Seeking peace? Another new trick
from Siling, am I right?

277
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,590
Everyone in heaven and earth knows that

278
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,480
Siling is determined to kill my Master.

279
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,410
How could she possibly seek peace?

280
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,310
I came here without her knowledge.

281
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,570
Don't try that with me.

282
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,190
My Master might be
deceived by your tricks,

283
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,230
but I won't be.

284
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,630
If you truly want peace,

285
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,920
then get Siling to come to
the Nine Heavens on her knees.

286
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,350
Let me give you some advice.

287
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,720
If you know what's good for you,
leave now.

288
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,880
You're not worthy of seeing my Master.

289
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
What if I insist on seeing
Heavenly Lord Dacheng today?

290
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,380
Then I will show you no mercy either.

291
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,690
No one came here today.

292
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Forget everything you've seen.

293
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,640
But clearly...

294
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,280
This...

295
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,550

was killed by lightning.

you have no right to see it.

335
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,070
This person shouldn't have existed.

336
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,000
Whether it's a person or an object,

337
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,750
everything exists for a reason.

338
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,160
You just haven't grasped

339
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,310
the meaning within.

340
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,310
Everything exists for a reason.

341
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,480
However, there's something I do
admire about you.

342
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,280
Even while witnessing
past tragedies firsthand,

343
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,810
you can still spare attention for others.

344

[Tomb of Jingyun Sect's Elder, Qing Yang]

345
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,370
Senior Meng.

346
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,790
Do you know why our Grandmaster

347
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,990
had gathered us here?

348
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,310
That's right.

349
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm not even a member of the sect,

350
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,410
so why was I called here too?

351
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,570
I don't know either.

352
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,110
Our Grandmaster must have her reasons.

353
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,790
My father just left the sect yesterday.

354
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,450
Could it be that the sect is
going to fight again?

355
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,620
Master Qing Yang sacrificed her life for the sect.

356
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
We must seek justice for her.

357
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,830
We, disciples, pay our respects to Grandmaster.

358
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,270
Those standing here today

359
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,610
are those who dare to stay
and confront Canglei Palace.

360
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,030
I thank you all for your assistance.

361
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,000
I am sure everyone would have heard

362
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,690
the death of Master Qing Yang.

363
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,880
Given that Canglei Palace dares to act this way,

364
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,480
it shows that they have no regard
for Jingyun Sect.

365
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,000
We should let them know

366
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,070
that Jingyun Sect is no pushover.

367
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,590
Please give your orders, Grandmaster.
This disciple swears to follow unto death.

368
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,990
This disciple swears to follow unto death.

369
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,550
We don't need them to come
and threaten us this time.

370
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,700
We will go to them.

Seven.

Do you think Qing Yang was killed
by Immortal Lord Long Yuan?

Rise.

383
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,690
You! Come here quickly to support me.

384
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,050
-What happened?
-Master.

385
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,510
-I feel dizzy.
-Master.

386
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,770
-Is this an earthquake?
-Master.

387
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,700
Are you alright?

388
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,930
Master, look!

389
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,630
Look!

390
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,480
The mountain!

391
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,350
My goodness, how is the mountain flying?

392
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,920
How is it flying so high?

393
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,120
Where is it flying to?

394
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,750
It seems to be flying up to the sky.

395
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,010
Flying up to the sky?

396
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,120
My Bian is still up there!

397
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,870
Young Master!

398
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,400
Bian!

399
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,510
Young Master!

400
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,490
Master, why are you drinking again?

401
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,090
Master.

402
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,970
Everyone has their own path to cultivation.

403
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,400
The path I walk is one of freedom.

404
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,580
And how can there be freedom without wine?

405
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,440
Whatever you say, Master.

406
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,510
On Mount Yuelu in mortal realm's Yuzhou,

407
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,030
a white tiger has cultivated immortality

408
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,280
and has entered Venerable Xuanyou's realm.

409
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,460
It's waiting to be officially recorded.

410
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,720
I'll find time to check on it tomorrow.

411
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,110
Lord Yu Ya.

412
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,350
It's been a long time since a human
became an immortal.

413
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,860
Indeed.

414
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,030
The last time was when Fan Jiaojiao
and her father ascended to immortality,

415
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,200
which was almost 200 years ago.

416
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,030
I've heard that human cultivators
are very active in the mortal realm.

417
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,880
How could they be find it more challenging

418
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,410
to achieve immortality than
mountain spirits and tree demons?

419
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,070
Heaven and earth turn in cycles,
and a dark tribulation is upon us.

420
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,480
Spiritual energy in the mortal realm
is scarce.

421
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,010
Humans have built
their own roads and cities,

422
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,510
far from the wilderness.

423
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,590
They can't absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth,
or the essence of the sun and moon.

424
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,270
It's difficult for them to cultivate into
immortals or gods.

425
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:56,240
It's much harder than those
mountain spirits and tree demons.

426
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,310
That makes sense.

427
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,830
You're right.

430
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,840
It's been hundreds of years.

431
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,100
Finally, a human cultivator has
achieved enlightenment.

432
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,000
Indeed.

433
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,650
But why is there only a name?

434
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,710
There's no rank or immortal position.

[Human cultivator, Xuan Wei of Jingyun Sect,
Yufan Mountain, Yong region]

Xuan Wei of Jingyun Sect.

437
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,730
He must be somebody
among the human cultivators.

438
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,920
Such a momentous event.

439
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,060
It should be recorded
in the immortal annals.

Two human cultivators have actually
ascended to immortality.

have been stuck here at
Wenxuan Palace for too long

450

that we become unaware of

I am from Jingyun Sect of Yufan Mountain,

499
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,190
Jiang Bian, disciple under Elder Dan Yang.

500
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,710
I am here to deliver a message on behalf of
my Grandmaster, Divine Lord Siling.

501
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,840
Is anyone there?

502
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,550
If you're there, answer me!

503
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,960
People of Canglei Palace, listen!

504
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,480
If you don't come out,

505
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,830
my Grandmaster, Divine Lord Siling,
will come knocking!

506
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,260
Do you hear me?

507
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,960
What did that person say?

508
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,980
Is anyone there?

509
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,180
He said that woman...

510
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,830
She's here!

511
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,830
After 400 years,

512
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,130
she's finally here.

513
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,840
Let's go.

514
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,320
Wait for me.

515
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,860
Why can't we get out?

516
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,360
I don't believe it.
Is there really a barrier?

517
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,280
I'll go check.

518
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,440
Is that Second Brother
being bounced back again?

519
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,670
Seems like it.

520
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,840
It's me, it's me!

521
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,810
I was bounced back again!

522
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,860
Big Brother, Third Brother,

523
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,940
there really is a barrier.

524
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,510
A barrier set by Bai Jiusi?

525
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,000
That woman got off easy.

526
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,210
There's a sound.

527
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,320
What is it?

528
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,600
Could... could they be coming out?

529
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,290
You vile weaklings of the divine realm!

530
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,710
Come out!

531
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,870
Come out!

532
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,960
Are you coming out or not?

533
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,320
And you call yourselves immortal lords
of the Nine Heavens.

534
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
How can you be so cowardly?

535
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,070
Immortal Lord Long Yuan,

536
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,870
please allow us to go battle him.

537
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,840
That scoundrel has gone too far!

538
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,960
The Heavenly Lord has presided over
Canglei Palace for 300 years.

539
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,220
He has never suffered such humiliation.

540
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,740
We request to fight.

541
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,720
Don't forget what Master said.

542
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,480
Whoever hurts someone from Jingyun Sect

543
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,400
will have their immortal bones destroyed

544
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,460
and be expelled from Canglei Palace.

545
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,510
So are we just supposed to tolerate
their rampant behavior?

546
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,360
Indeed. A mere mortal

547
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,020
has come knocking at our door.

548
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,890
I've said it before.

549
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,980
Master shouldn't have been
soft-hearted towards her.

550
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,090
Senior.

551
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Step aside!

552
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,930
I've already sent a Blood Spell to Master.

553
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,070
He'll be back soon.

554
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,310
Senior, I suggest you
hold back a bit more.

555
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,480
Don't forget the last time,

556
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,980
Immortal Lord Cang Tu and I had to
speak on your behalf

557
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,910
before you were barely allowed to stay.

558
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,440
If you make a big fuss again,

559
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,290
I'm afraid Master won't let you stay anymore.

560
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,840
Grandmaster, the people inside
don't dare to come out.

561
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,320
There's a barrier at the entrance.

562
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I can't get in.

563
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,480
If he's unwilling to come out,

564
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,330
then we'll send ourselves in.

565
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,300
It's been a long time, everyone.

566
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,590
When an old friend pays a visit,
shouldn't you at least come out to greet us?

567
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,990
You even set up a barrier.

568
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,240
This isn't exactly good hospitality.

569
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,750
Siling,

570
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,930
you dare to bring mortals to
trespass the divine realm.

571
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,190
Do you know your crime?

572
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,370
If you people can go to the mortal realm,

573
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,770
why can't mortals come to the Nine Heavens?

574
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,710
Long Yuan.

575
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,810
since you dare to kill
Jingyun Sect's Master Qing Yang,

576
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,140
you should have expected this day to come.

577
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,070
Don't try to smear me.

578
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,220
Our Master has spared you,

579
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,730
yet you show up here causing trouble?

580
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,930
So you dare not admit to your deed?

581
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,670
It's just a pity for the other disciples

582
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,490
of Canglei Palace who will be
implicated because of you.

583
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,020
Previously, you gave
Jingyun Sect five days.

584
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,400
Today, I'll give Canglei Palace one day.

585
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,050
If you can deliver
Long Yuan's head tomorrow

586
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,450
as an exchange for a life,

587
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,080
we can let bygones be bygones

588
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,840
and no longer trouble Canglei Palace.

589
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,270
You want my head?

590
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,840
Let's see if you
have the ability to take it.

591
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,960
Listen carefully,
disciples of Canglei Palace.

592
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,940
If we don't see Long Yuan's head tomorrow,

593
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,000
we'll storm in right in and kill.

594
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,800
If the rest of you want to live,

595
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,090
leave as soon as possible.

596
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,150
Siling.

597
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,070
It's the fifth day by now.

598
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,430
You should return my daughter to me now.

599
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,840
If you want Ling'er,

600
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,490
come to Jingyun Sect yourself to get her.

601
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,360
An old acquaintance has come to see me.
You go back first.

602
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,230
Grand... Grandmaster!

603
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,280
No,

604
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,840
Grandmaster, how am I supposed to go back?

605
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,550
This is way too high!

606
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Heavenly Emissary, if you are here
just to try and mediate,

607
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,180
then there's no need to talk any further.

608
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,630
Siling, you've brought mortals to ascend
to Nine Heavens.

609
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,140
This journey itself violates the order.

610
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,320
Previously, when Long Yuan used
the Skyshade Mirror

611
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,920
to warn the mortal realm,

612
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,850
I didn't see you intervening.

613
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,530
Now that mortals have ascended,
you show up.

614
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,260
So? Are immortals allowed to
offend mortals without consequence,

615
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,120
while mortals offending immortals
deserve death?

616
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,800
Bai Jiusi and I

617
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,960
have been in conflict since
the beginning of time.

618
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,710
All these years,

619
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,180
we've never interfered with
the order of this world.

620
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,440
Now that Long Yuan has issued a challenge,

621
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,700
I've come to accept it.

622
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,360
This could also be considered maintaining
the laws of heaven and earth, I suppose.

623
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,020
Even immortals have grudges.

624
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,110
How you settle your private disputes

625
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,710
is indeed beyond my control.

626
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,740
But you shouldn't involve
innocent mortals or immortals.

627
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,150
Long Yuan previously gave
the people of Jingyun Sect

628
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,480
time to leave.

629
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,280
Now, I've also given the disciples
of Canglei Palace

630
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,230
time to leave.

631
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,030
So those who voluntarily stay behind,
be they mortal or immortal,

632
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,710
are doing so on their own free will

633
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,440
and will not implicate others.

634
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,800
Siling, from beginning to end,

635
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,320
there are only two things that I value.

636
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,280
First, maintaining the laws of heaven,

637
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,080
and second, the Infinite Stele.

638
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,410
Long Yuan is Bai Jiusi's chief disciple.

639
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,110
If you kill him, Bai Jiusi naturally
won't stand by idly.

640
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,490
I'm sure you're aware

641
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,000
that although Bai Jiusi is not part of
the heavenly order,

642
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,670
he bears the heavy responsibility of
guarding the Infinite Stele.

643
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,800
If you're acting out of selfish desire

644
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,070
and endanger the existence of
the Infinite Stele,

645
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,330
I'd of course not stand by and do nothing.

646
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,710
If this is what you're concerned about,

647
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,800
I can assure you

648
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,920
that Bai Jiusi and I

649
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,230
are both formed from the vital energy of
the Primordial God.

650
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,430
Our powers are equal.

651
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,400
What he can do, I can as well.

652
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,760
Regardless of who lives or dies between us,

653
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,630
someone will always guard the Infinite Stele.

654
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,110
The Infinite Stele is not something you can

655
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,840
casually make promises about.

656
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,590
Without proof, why should I believe you?

657
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,970
After tomorrow passes, you will
know everything.

658
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,190
Regardless of the outcome,

659
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,230
once this matter is settled,

660
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,710
I will bring Jingyun Sect back
from the Nine Heavens.

661
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,570
I will certainly not disrupt
the order of the world.

662
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,710
Alright, I'll trust you this once.

663
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,880
If you harbor any deceit,

664
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,850
you will surely face divine punishment.

665
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,710
I will never break my word.
