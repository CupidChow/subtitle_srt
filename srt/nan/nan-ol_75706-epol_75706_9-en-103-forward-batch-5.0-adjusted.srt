[Episode 9]

3
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,410
My Lord, please calm down.

4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,479
Calm down?

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,759
Li Shuang showed me such disrespect.

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,680
How can I possibly calm down?

7
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,190
To upset yourself so much

8
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,039
over a criminal's daughter

9
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,150
is not worth it.

10
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,840
Had I known Li Shuang was so arrogant,

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,680
I'd have given her dozens more strokes.

12
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,430
You,

13
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,310
write a letter to the court at once.

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,870
Report that the one who killed Huo Du
is hiding in the Changfeng Army.

15
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,530
If Li Shuang dares shield him,

16
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,750
I'd like to see
how she's going to pull that off.

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,360
My Lord,

18
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,660
that's not advisable.

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,240
Li Shuang must know

20
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,050
that he was just a servant,

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,760
and even if he were handed to the court,

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,340
His Majesty wouldn't be satisfied.

23
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,750
Yet to protect him,

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,280
she fell out with you in public,

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,410
even at the risk of crossing Prince Li.

26
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,350
Looks like that boy

27
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,350
means a great deal to her.

28
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,120
Have you looked into his background?

29
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,190
His name is Jin'an.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,190
I heard that Li Shuang
took him back a while ago.

31
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,240
He's homeless,

32
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,780
a useless wretch with no martial skills.

33
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,650
No martial skills?

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,150
Then how did he kill Huo Du?

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,060
I've already investigated it.

36
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,530
It was just an accident.

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,550
They say
he merely pushed Huo Du accidentally,

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,560
and that worthless fool just died.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Sit. Tell me more.

40
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,790
So you're suggesting

41
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,940
that I do Li Shuang a favor and let it go?

42
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,030
Exactly, My Lord.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,310
Although Li Wei has been demoted,

44
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,030
the Li family and the Changfeng Army

45
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,190
are not to be underestimated.

46
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,310
If you can persuade

47
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,630
Li Shuang to align with Prince Li,

48
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,560
His Highness will surely be pleased,

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
and you'll win

50
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,150
His Highness's favor.

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,520
If Li Shuang still refuses to cooperate,

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,470
you can bide your time to deal with her

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
and Jin'an later.

54
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,160
Send word to the General's Residence.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,670
Tell them I'll pay a visit

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,960
later today.

57
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,200
Yes.

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,280
Who does Li Zhangyi think he is?

59
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,860
He hurt you so badly.

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,700
You always worry about me.

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
But after all these years by my side,

62
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,320
you should be used to it.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,180
Don't I always get injured

64
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,030
now and then?

65
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,120
How could I ever get used to it?

66
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,600
You're my best friend.

67
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,680
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

68
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,070
At worst,

69
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,140
I'll be more careful.

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,140
I just need to be more careful.

71
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,130
You're always trying to be tough.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,730
I'm leaving now.

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,680
Remember to apply the ointment.

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,409
Don't worry.

75
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,659
I'll be fine soon.

76
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,670
What's wrong?

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
Nothing.

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Take care on the road.

79
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,920
I'm off.

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,070
Shuang,

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
it's over between you
and the Crown Prince.

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,560
Rather than dwelling on the past,

83
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,790
you should let it go

84
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,600
and cherish what you have now.

85
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Ji.

86
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,680
Miss.

87
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,230
Although this is the General's Residence,

88
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,720
it's also where Shuang lives.

89
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,050
With women everywhere,

90
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,830
your frequent visits

91
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,970
may not be proper.

92
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,600
Miss,

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,810
you misunderstand.

94
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,050
I'm here to report
something important to General.

95
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,000
Judging from your expression

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,630
and gait,

97
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,210
it doesn't seem like an urgent matter

98
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,070
that requires a personal visit.

99
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,140
You know best
if there's any misunderstanding.

100
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,720
I am

101
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
just offering a friendly reminder.

102
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,390
Just now,

103
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,480
I took matters into my own hands.

104
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,280
You don't blame me?

105
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,830
You owned up to it.

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,180
In that situation,

107
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,360
you stepped out and took the blame.

108
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
Why would I blame you?

109
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,420
But what you did today

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,750
has pulled you

111
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,890
into this power struggle.

112
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,800
They won't

113
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,690
let you off easily.

114
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,730
Li Zhangyi is Prince Li's man.

115
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,630
Prince Li is

116
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,070
both favored

117
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,990
and trusted
by His Majesty.

118
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,210
Why didn't you compromise?

119
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,820
Prince Li is ambitious

120
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,730
and aspires to be the crown prince.

121
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,830
If he truly gains military power,

122
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,490
he will certainly start a war.

123
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,000
When that day comes,

124
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,760
it's the common folks who will suffer.

125
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,830
Since ancient times,

126
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,750
the fight for the throne
has always been bloody.

127
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,600
Perhaps you're just a pawn too.

128
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,700
Why get yourself involved?

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,680
Perhaps

130
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,390
I am just a pawn.

131
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,800
But I don't want to be involved
in court politics.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,750
I only know

133
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,100
that behind me stand the Li family

134
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,280
and the Changfeng Army.

135
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,370
All I want is to protect

136
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,270
the people I should protect.

137
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
I decided to come back

138
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,850
because I wanted to face this with you.

139
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,780
It's my fault that I failed

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,460
to protect you—

141
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,250
letting Li Zhangyi hurt you like this.

142
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,560
Being in the eye of the storm,

143
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,150
I'm bound to suffer a little.

144
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:21,990
Gen…

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,670
General.

146
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,790
Li Zhangyi has sent word.

147
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,720
Tonight,

148
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,420
he'll visit you in person.

149
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,410
Make the arrangements.

150
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,790
Prepare a banquet for him.

151
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,200
Yes.

152
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,110
Your wound has opened again.

153
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,070
Let me bandage it for you.

154
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,550
It might hurt a bit.

155
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Let me attend tonight's banquet

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,920
with you.

157
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,190
You said
I'm already involved in this struggle.

158
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,120
If you hide me away on purpose,

159
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,600
Li Zhangyi

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,900
certainly won't let it go.

161
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,980
Besides, if I'm there,

162
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,080
I can protect you.

163
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,590
Protect me? How?

164
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,170
You're as weak as a kitten now,

165
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,750
and you've lost the supernatural strength
you had as a child.

166
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,480
How are you going to protect me?

167
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,970
Last time you took a blade for me

168
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,750
and barely survived.

169
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,670
Instead of risking your life for me,

170
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I'd rather

171
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,080
you stay alive and well.

172
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,150
As the mastermind behind everything,

173
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,390
she surely knows
you're bound by the blood pact

174
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,520
and can't leave her.

175
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,550
She wants you to obey her willingly.

176
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
What's wrong?

177
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,550
Nothing.

178
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,790
Don't move.

179
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
You're bleeding.

180
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,670
If I still had some of my strength,

181
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,730
I could at least do something for you.

182
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,440
But things are so unpredictable with me,

183
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
and I might never return to how I was.

184
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,120
I'm completely useless now.

185
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,170
Why are you still willing
to keep me by your side?

186
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,510
Most of the women

187
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,910
in my residence

188
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,320
are homeless castaways.

189
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,320
Since you have nowhere to go,

190
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,840
you might as well stay here for now.

191
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,670
Besides,

192
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
there's still

193
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,180
the blood pact between us.

194
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,910
There's a dense forest outside Lucheng.

195
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,720
Three days from now,

196
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,390
you must find a way

197
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,320
to bring Li Shuang there.

198
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,910
Only then

199
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,350
can I have a chance
to break your blood pact.

200
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,630
To you,

201
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,030
is this blood pact

202
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,120
a blessing

203
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,030
or a curse?

204
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,200
If it could be broken,

205
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,120
would you try?

206
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:16,930
Or…

207
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,530
would you still choose to keep me here?

208
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,670
Mr. Ji.

209
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
How is General?

210
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,240
Her wound's been dressed.

211
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Nothing serious.

212
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,390
What did you

213
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,120
and General do

214
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,750
in Ninglan?

215
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,970
You're her right-hand man.

216
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,320
Why are you asking

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,440
an outsider like me?

218
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,930
Wouldn't it be quicker

219
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,330
to ask her directly?

220
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,820
When you speak of General,

221
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,240
show some respect.

222
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,530
Exercising your authority

223
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,440
on the battlefield is not enough,

224
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,700
and now you're forcing me
to be grateful?

225
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,200
You have no right
to complain about General.

226
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,400
If it weren't for you,

227
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,550
she wouldn't have been punished today.

228
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,790
Your past is suspicious.

229
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,590
She already showed you mercy
by sparing your life.

230
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,320
Before leaving for Ninglan,

231
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,490
she even asked me to find your portrait

232
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,080
and look into your past,

233
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,660
just to give you a surprise.

234
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,750
Why did she do that?

235
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,960
You saved Young Master.

236
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,880
That makes her indebted to you.

237
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,950
If you dare use that debt of gratitude

238
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,200
and be rude to her,

239
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,790
I'll kill you myself.

240
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,840
She cares so much about me,

241
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,270
yet I let others mislead me

242
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,770
and doubted her.

243
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,510
My sharp senses

244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,830
are back.

245
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,170
General,

246
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,480
Lord Li has arrived.

247
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,970
General, I gave you strokes today.

248
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
Though it was official business,

249
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
I fear it might have offended you

250
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,830
and damaged our bond as colleagues.

251
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,120
I hope you won't take offense.

252
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,880
You overthink it, My Lord.

253
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,250
Achievements should be rewarded.

254
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,580
Mistakes should be punished.

255
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,710
That's the rule of the Changfeng Army.

256
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
Speaking of rules,

257
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,810
tell me then,

258
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,560
is Jin'an killing Huo Du

259
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,960
an achievement…

260
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,890
or a mistake?

261
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,110
I was just joking.

262
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,410
The Changfeng Army is known
for its strict discipline.

263
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,370
If you insist on protecting him,

264
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,270
you must have your reasons.

265
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,640
It's just that

266
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,070
when I think of Mr. Li,

267
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,410
who has illustrious military achievements

268
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,210
yet is affected because of this,

269
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,490
I feel bad for him.

270
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,140
This dagger is forged of cold iron,

271
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,100
sharp enough to cut through steel.

272
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,720
The pearl on its hilt
is
from the southern seas—

273
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,800
a once-in-a-century find.

274
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,240
Prince Li,

275
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,070
knowing your fondness
for fine weapons,

276
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,970
had this dagger made

277
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,360
especially for you.

278
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,920
Prince Li is

279
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,210
of noble rank.

280
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,750
His gift
is

281
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,070
lavish indeed.

282
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,090
Unfortunately,

283
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,030
I,

284
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,110
as a rough warrior,

285
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,150
am not used to such delicate things.

286
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,230
I'm afraid I can't accept

287
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,940
His Highness's kindness.

288
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,530
General Li,

289
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,640
you truly don't know what's good for you.

290
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,350
Have you forgotten your place

291
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,080
after being admired for so long

292
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,540
at the border?

293
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,400
Lord Li,

294
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
you are mistaken.

295
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,070
The Li family
is Taijin's loyal subject.

296
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,290
The Changfeng Army

297
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,730
consists of Taijin citizens.

298
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,860
For generations,

299
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,890
we've only sought to defend Taijin.

300
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,770
We know

301
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,720
our duty

302
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and have never forgotten our place.

303
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,200
My Lord,

304
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,560
General Li is devoted
to serving the country.

305
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
That's a blessing to Taijin.

306
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,350
Indeed,

307
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,030
I came today

308
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,110
just to have a simple meal

309
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,720
and offer my apologies.

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,090
I didn't expect

311
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,700
to upset you again, General.

312
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,830
My bad.

313
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
My bad.

314
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,000
Just sitting here eating and drinking
is so boring.

315
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,830
Why not

316
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,140
arrange some entertainment?

317
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,440
No girl in your residence

318
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,480
is ordinary.

319
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,250
I'm afraid

320
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,350
they can't sing or dance.

321
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,960
I heard that you're skilled

322
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,400
in riding and archery.

323
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,170
As it happens,

324
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,070
I know a thing or two about them.

325
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,480
Why don't we

326
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
have a contest?

327
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,710
What do you say?

328
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,830
Lord Li,

329
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,720
General is injured

330
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,070
and shouldn't draw a bow.

331
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,000
Please allow me

332
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,030
to take her place.

333
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,070
Generals get injured

334
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,110
in battle all the time,

335
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,780
but the war still goes on.

336
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,550
Surely they wouldn't

337
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,010
surrender just because of

338
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,710
an injury.

339
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,830
-But...
-Ji Ran,

340
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,490
stand down.

341
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,730
Don't spoil the fun for Lord Li.

342
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,310
Yes.

343
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,160
Lord Li,

344
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,840
please.

345
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,880
General,

346
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,100
since it's a contest,

347
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,400
shouldn't we

348
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,100
place a wager
to make it more interesting?

349
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,640
My Lord, what do you have in mind?

350
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,990
If I win,

351
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,410
you must accept

352
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,370
the precious dagger from Prince Li.

353
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,310
And if you lose?

354
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,240
If you lose,

355
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,570
you'll drop all charges against Jin'an.

356
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,330
As for Huo Du

357
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,020
colluding with the Yao State,

358
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,960
I will give His Majesty

359
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,620
a satisfactory explanation.

360
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,110
Report!

361
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,910
Lord Li scored nine points.

362
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,070
Seven points.

363
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,270
Eight points.

364
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,030
Nine points.

365
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,480
Six points.

366
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,530
A total of 39 points.

367
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,640
General,

368
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,560
you'd better think it through.

369
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,540
With Prince Li's help in the capital,

370
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,340
your father

371
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,800
would surely suffer less.

372
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,350
Since General's wager concerns me,

373
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,810
I should be the one

374
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,440
to shoot the arrows.

375
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,110
What do you think, Lord Li?

376
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,200
Your fate

377
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,400
should be in your own hands.

378
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,610
But if you take her place,

379
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,120
the rules are broken,

380
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,510
and the wager

381
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,580
must double.

382
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,450
Anything you say, My Lord.

383
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,750
Very well.

384
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,030
Then…

385
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,350
we'll wager your life.

386
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,970
Lord Li!

387
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,020
As you wish.

388
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,010
Missed.

389
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,970
Zero points.

390
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,640
10 points.

391
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,590
10 points.

392
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,780
10 points.

393
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,160
10 points.

394
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,440
Total of 40 points.

395
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,430
Since

396
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,430
we had a bet,

397
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,800
I hope you

398
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,690
will honor your agreement.

399
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,240
Fine.

400
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,630
Let's go.

401
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,240
You've been by my side for so long,

402
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,160
yet I had no idea

403
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,600
you had such remarkable skills.

404
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,240
Your wound is bleeding again.

405
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,640
Let me bandage it for you.

406
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,140
You deliberately
missed the target earlier.

407
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,270
You were testing me.

408
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,110
He threatened you with your father,

409
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,760
so I had to know where your heart lies.

410
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,400
You…

411
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,400
I heard it.

412
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,260
Where my heart lies has never changed.

413
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,030
Do you think I only care

414
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,030
about my father?

415
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,480
I care about your life too.

416
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,440
We've only

417
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,790
known each other for a few months.

418
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,480
I shouldn't

419
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,000
mean so much to you.

420
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,590
Why do you care so much

421
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,010
about whether I live or die?

422
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,140
In these chaotic times,

423
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,800
staying alive is hard enough.

424
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,600
How could I let you die so easily?

425
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,100
Ji Ran told me

426
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,810
you went to Zang Budu

427
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,880
to find out about my past,

428
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,540
not to investigate me.

429
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,180
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,130
I haven't uncovered anything yet.

431
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,000
There was nothing to say.

432
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,590
Perhaps you're right.

433
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,830
We've not known each other long.

434
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,400
I shouldn't have pried.

435
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,310
It's my fault

436
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,270
this time.

437
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,820
If I'd had more patience

438
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,410
or thought things through,

439
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,050
maybe I wouldn't have misunderstood you.

440
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,410
I overestimated myself…

441
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,020
and underestimated you.

442
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,930
Then tell me—

443
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,190
back in Ninglan,
you were already acting strange.

444
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,720
After we returned,
you kept testing me.

445
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,520
What is it you're hiding from me?

446
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,440
That's the whole story.

447
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,710
Do you have anything to say?

448
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,710
You already have doubts.

449
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,600
I have nothing to say.

450
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,720
Since I lost my memory,

451
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,160
that was the first time
someone had mentioned my past.

452
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,270
Naturally, I had to think it over.

453
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,610
But I figured it out.

454
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,870
I trust you.

455
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,080
You've lost all your memories.

456
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,880
What makes you trust me?

457
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,440
Without memories,

458
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,380
I still have my intuition.

459
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,030
You've never mistreated me

460
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,230
or anyone around you.

461
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,830
I trust what I see

462
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,480
and what I feel.

463
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,180
What about the blood pact?

464
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,470
It inflicts excruciating pain on you

465
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,880
and robs you of freedom.

466
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,500
If it could be broken,

467
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,800
why not give it a try?

468
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,680
If it can be broken,

469
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,120
I'll find the way myself

470
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,940
instead of putting you in danger with me.

471
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,140
Have you considered…

472
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,690
maybe that person

473
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,410
was telling the truth?

474
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
I want to tell you

475
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,400
that even if the blood pact

476
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,060
was deliberately made by you,

477
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,010
I still want to have

478
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,930
a deeper bond with you.

479
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,980
She keeps you by her side

480
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,440
just to use you

481
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,880
and turn you

482
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,970
into a bloodthirsty beast.

483
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,150
Since I've chosen to trust Li Shuang,

484
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,240
I can't let him influence me.

485
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,520
Master.

486
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,550
It's still early.

487
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,240
That shadow puppet

488
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,370
might show up later.

489
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,330
You still don't understand human nature.

490
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,480
I gave him three days.

491
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,110
If he meant to come,

492
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,460
he'd be here already.

493
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,850
Empress Dowager's 10-day limit
is almost up.

494
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,920
What should we do?

495
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,590
Ultimately,

496
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,060
a shadow puppet can't live
without their blood master.

497
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,420
If we control Li Shuang,

498
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,540
the shadow puppet
will be easy to deal with.

499
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,110
I've changed your dressing.

500
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,790
Be careful these days.

501
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,920
Don't get injured again,

502
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,650
understand?

503
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Sorry for troubling you.

504
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,750
Don't be absurd.

505
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,610
There's no trouble at all.

506
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,880
Your quick recovery

507
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,830
is the best reward

508
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,230
for me as your physician.

509
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,560
I'll write you a prescription.

510
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,960
Take the medicine for a few days.

511
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
It's just a superficial wound.

512
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,160
Why do I need to take medicine?

513
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,220
That's exactly it.

514
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,220
Normally, this kind of wound

515
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
would almost be healed in a few days.

516
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,570
Why is it healing so slowly this time?

517
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,350
Your body must not be

518
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,720
as strong as before.

519
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,890
Look at you—

520
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,240
pale as a ghost.

521
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,070
One might think

522
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,730
you've been drained of blood.

523
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,350
Could it really

524
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,040
be related to Jin'an taking my blood?

525
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,400
This one

526
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,600
is the prescription.

527
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,190
And this map

528
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,510
shows a natural hot spring

529
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,140
in the forest outside the city.

530
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,200
You only need to soak in it

531
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,090
for about 30 minutes,

532
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,360
and it'll promote blood circulation

533
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,960
and fade scars.

534
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,160
When you're better,

535
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,290
go there regularly.

536
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,770
I don't have time for that.

537
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,550
Make time!

538
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,590
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

539
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,450
I'll go.

540
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,920
Who is there?

541
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,310
Don't waste your energy.

542
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,409
My camp was ambushed

543
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,320
twice before.

544
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,810
You were behind it?

545
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,310
Sharp as ever, General.

546
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,230
What is it you want?

547
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,000
What you picked up in the Barren Forest

548
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,679
was mine to begin with.

549
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,739
I just want it back.

550
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,190
You mean

551
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,560
Jin'an?

552
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,590
Your approach

553
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,800
is inappropriate.

554
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,900
Then call me presumptuous.

555
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,360
But I'm doing it for your sake.

556
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,070
Having someone of unknown origin
by your side

557
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,320
must be unsettling.

558
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,739
Give him to me

559
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,110
so we don't have to go against each other.

560
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,510
I took him in,

561
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,840
so he's mine now.

562
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,050
Whether I keep him

563
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,150
or kill him,

564
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,360
no one else has any say in it.

565
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,400
Is that so?

566
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,740
Then you'll have to suffer for it.

567
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,940
How is this happening?

568
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,950
Li Shuang.

569
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,880
Holding out until now

570
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,630
and still not begging for mercy.

571
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,030
You deserve your reputation
as Taijin's top female general.

572
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,630
I never expected

573
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,590
such a perfect fusion.

574
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,420
Li Shuang!

575
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,150
No!

576
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,560
If you don't want her to die,

577
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,940
you must come with me.

578
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Then I'll let her go.

579
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,700
I'll go with you.

580
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,030
So you truly love your blood master.

581
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,590
Tell me,

582
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,880
after each transformation,

583
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,590
are you always this lucid?

584
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,120
Yes.

585
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,430
How long does it last?

586
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,590
Two hours.

587
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,520
I never imagined

588
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,280
Jade Linglong
could fuse with you
so perfectly.

589
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,230
So you're the one

590
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,760
behind all this.

591
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Now that you know,

592
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,220
you must realize—

593
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,630
only I hold the answers

594
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,420
to your past.

595
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,600
Come with me,

596
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,030
and I'll give you the answers.

597
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,150
What do you say?

598
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,510
Master.

599
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,710
Let's go.

600
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,500
[General's Residence]

601
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,360
Urgent military report!

602
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,940
General is not in the residence now.

603
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,820
Do you know

604
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,610
where she is at the moment?

605
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,360
General!

606
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,480
General!

607
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,190
General!

608
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,160
General!

609
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,240
General!

610
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,360
General!

611
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,720
General!

612
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,120
General,

613
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,760
the enemy has reached the border.
