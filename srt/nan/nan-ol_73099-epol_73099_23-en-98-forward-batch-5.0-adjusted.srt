[Episode 23]

3
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,680
And then?

4
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,509
Years flew by after that,

5
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,810
and somehow we started fighting.

6
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,550
We'd fight every time we met.

7
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
But that was fine.

8
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,010
At least it let me
see him from time to time.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,360
I thought

10
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,760
we would keep fighting like this forever.

11
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,520
Until one day,
he suddenly invited me to go

12
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
be a couple with him in the mortal realm

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,660
to pass the love tribulation.

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,600
I played it cool on the surface,

15
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,829
yet I was actually exhilarated.

16
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,360
We spent a hundred years together
in the mortal realm.

17
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,850
Despite occasional quarrels and fights,

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,870
those were my happiest days.

19
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,400
I even prayed deep down inside,

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
hoping that we would never
pass this love tribulation

21
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
so as to live together forever.

22
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,310
But later...

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,590
Later, he fell in love with someone else

24
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,680
and abandoned you.

25
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,310
Then you swore to kill him for vengeance.

26
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,080
Am I right?

27
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,030
Go on.

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,590
Please continue.

29
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,960
Since birth,
I've had a soft spot for mortals.

30
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,280
But he was born aloof,

31
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,120
more like a god compared to me.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,800
Lofty, indifferent, and solitary,

33
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,740
detached from the masses.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,250
Later, because of an incident,

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,079
he sealed my power

36
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,880
and left me in the mortal realm.

37
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,950
Not until then did I realize that

38
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,390
I was the only one who had fallen in love.

39
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,120
He spent all that time with me
just to pass the tribulation—

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,150
nothing more.

41
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,630
You can travel through time and space
in the Three Realms.

42
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,830
Of course I can since I'm in charge
of the rising and setting

43
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,760
of the sun and moon,
the calendar of heaven and earth.

44
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,480
The universe is boundless,
unlike the Three Realms.

45
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,310
From primordial essence comes matter;
from matter comes space;

46
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,680
from space comes time;
from time comes everything.

47
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,430
I am the God of the Sun,

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,750
the Mother of Time.

49
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,760
Then can you change the past and future?

50
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,250
Everything in the world,
karma, and reincarnation

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,159
are all under your control.

52
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:01,040
Do you know

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,430
something is immutable in the cosmos?

54
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,920
The sun rises in the east
and sets in the west;

55
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,870
plants flourish in summer
and wither in autumn;

56
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,360
karma and reincarnation
occur in their own way.

57
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,800
I can travel through time and space
in the Three Realms,

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
holding sway over
the sun, moon, and stars,

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,070
but I'm merely a witness

60
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,270
of the long history.

61
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,690
Because all things in the world,
karma, and reincarnation

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,260
take their own course.

63
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,040
Then how can I see

64
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
the past that I wish to see?

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,120
Bai Jiusi, your real karma is here.

66
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,920
This is the past,

67
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,630
the ten years when you left your wife
in the mortal realm.

68
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,390
You don't belong to this time and space.

69
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,270
But you can see

70
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,730
the people and events
of this time and space.

71
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,920
However, they can't see or hear you.

72
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,830
Bai Jiusi...

73
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,870
You're such a bastard!

74
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,920
Master!

75
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,690
It's been three months.

76
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,310
You really can't drink anymore.

77
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
Why can't I?

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,659
Because...

79
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,430
Your mortal realm's alcohol

80
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,390
is really something great.

81
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,310
Master.

82
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,160

84
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,870
Master!

85
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
He left.

86
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,750
He abandoned me.

87
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,390

Okay.

91
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
You should quit drinking from now on.

92
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,540
If you keep this up,

93
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,130
you will be totally wrecked

94
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,400
even though you're an immortal.

95
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,760
Your wife is pregnant, you know?

96
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,670
What?

97
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,930
She's four months pregnant.
You don't know that?

98
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,480
What did you say?

99
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,910
You're already four months pregnant.

100
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,110
None of you knew that?

101
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,790
You're too careless.

Yeah.

104
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,850
I want to continue.

105
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,070
You're almost there!

106
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,080
I can see the head! Just need a push.

107
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,670
There we go! The baby's out!

108

Don't cry, don't cry.

Congratulations, it's a boy.

Master, it's a boy.

114
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,970
He doesn't have a name yet.

115
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,440
Let's call him Shi'an.

116
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,750
My mom thinks so too.

117
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,910
She also entrusted
a fortune-teller in the north of the city

118
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,320
to get me a new name—

119
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,390
Lin Shi'an.

120
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,200
She said it means "peace across the land."

121
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,600
-Don't cry.
-I'll go get you some food.

122
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
Meet your mother.

123
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:53,910
Come on.

124

Don't cry, good boy.

126

Don't cry, Shi'an.

127
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,630
Uncle Bai, did you see
my bamboo dragonfly?

128
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,600
I just let go,

129
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,460
and it disappeared with a whoosh.

Who allowed you to play here?

135
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,550
I do have a dad!

136
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,790
Don't let him go! Stop him!

137
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,510
Stop him there!

138
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,040
How dare you try to run away?

139
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Where's your father?

140
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,960
My father is up in heaven!

141
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,330
So he's dead, huh?

142
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,490
Says you! My father isn't dead!

143
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,480
Look, this is my dad.

144
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,720
Do not ever call me

145
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,080
a fatherless brat again!

146
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,360
I do have a dad!

147
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,080
You can find all the truths in the past.

148
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,150
Although you were born a god,

149
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,960
you cannot see all the truths.

150
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
My dad is not dead!

151
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,150
He's not!

152

153
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,360
Continue.

154
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,000
I want to know the whole story.

155
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,910
The world moves in a grand cycle
of ten thousand years.

156
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,550
Plagues and wars

157
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,450
are common in the mortal realm.

158
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,270
This family's awash with money and food!

159
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,510
Everyone, if you don't want to starve,
join me in looting!

160
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,750
Yeah! Let's loot!

161
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,920
Come on, loot!

Open the door! Ram it!

-Harder!
-Open the door!

164
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,480
Mother, I'm so scared.

165
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,720
They're unbelievably rampant.

166
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,250
Master, I'll go fight them!

167
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,550
We're outnumbered.
Better not pick a fight.

168
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,670
Let them plunder as they wish.

169
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,400
Let's leave.

170
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,240

Open the door!

172
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,800
Be careful, Master.

173
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:40,970
Master.

174
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,440
Let's go!

175
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,080
Master, you go first.

176
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,370
Let's go.

177
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,650
Stop there! Don't come any closer!

178
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,360
Stop!

179
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,240
What are you doing? Back off!

180
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
He's alone! Charge through! Ignore him!

181
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,720
Ignore him.

182
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,310
Go wait for me at the gate.

183
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,240
I'll go save him.

184
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,270
Go!

185
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,160
Go to hell!

186
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,069
Stop hitting!

187
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,880
Go away!

188
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,680
Stop hitting!

189
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,069
Where is the food? Hand it over!

190
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
Guys! Let's go to the back
and grab the food! Hurry!

191
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,510
Mother!

192
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,960
Shi'an!

193
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,920
Mother!

194
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,550
Master?

195
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,830
Master!

196
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,310
Master!

197
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,480
Master, you're awake.

198
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,240
How do you feel?

199
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,090
I'll go get you the med.

200
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,750
It's okay.

201
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,400
Shi'an.

202
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,110
Shi'an?

203
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,310
Shi'an.

204
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,880
He's having a fever.
I'll go get him some meds.

205
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,440
Shi'an.

206
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,680
Shi'an.

207
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,400
Shi'an?

208
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,480
Shi'an!

209
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,790
Master, Master.

210
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,930
Here you are.

211
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,110
You hold him, and I'll feed him.

212
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,590
Okay.

213
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,270
Come on, Shi'an.

214
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,810
Shi'an.

215
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,880
Shi'an, take it.

216
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,330
It's the medicine.

217
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,160
Shi'an.

218
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,250
Master, he's not drinking.

219
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,630
Let me try.

220
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,960
Shi'an, take this medicine,

221
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,240
and I will take you to fly a kite.

222
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,960
Okay?

223
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,960
Come on.

224
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,400
Shi'an, I can't live without you.

225
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,070
Take the medicine.

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,480
Come on.

227
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,010

Master, calm down.

I'll go get other prescriptions.

Don't scare me.

Where's Uncle Changqin?

257
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,010
He went to buy you medicine.

258
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,200
Mother, I'm feeling terrible.

259
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,240
Mother, Uncle Changqin said
you're a goddess from heaven.

260
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,720
You used to live in heaven, right?

261
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,480
Yes.

262
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Is it beautiful up there?

263
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,850
It's beautiful.

264
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,350
Up there in heaven,

265
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,440
it's the closest to the sun.

266
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,000
At sunrise,

267
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,680
the clouds are bathed in sunlight,

268
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,310
looking like clumps of golden malt sugar.

269
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,400
Mother, if immortals get really hungry,

270
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,030
do they eat the clouds in the sky?

271
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,170
No, they don't.

272
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:18,400
There are assorted
delicious divine fruits in heaven,

273
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,350
and desserts too.

274
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,590
Besides, immortals have
spiritual energy to back them up.

275
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,850
They don't get hungry.

276
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,070
Then immortals
don't get sick either, right?

277
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,720
Yeah, immortals don't get sick.

278
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,920
Mother, is Father an immortal too?

279
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,440
He's the most powerful immortal
in the Nine Heavens.

280
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,440
Mother, if both you
and Father are immortals,

281
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,400
why don't I have spiritual energy?

282
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,350
Why do I get sick?

283
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,750
Why can't I protect you?

284
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,200
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

285
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,110
When I was pregnant with you,

286
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,830
my power was sealed.

287
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,470
You couldn't absorb any spiritual energy.

288
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,160
So you're no different
from ordinary children.

289
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,160
But it's okay.

290
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,450
Just wait three more years.

291
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,640
In three years, I'll have my power back.

292
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,610
I'll take you back to the Nine Heavens.

293
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,240
You can enjoy divine fruits
and miraculous medicine.

294
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,680
I'll teach you
immortal power and techniques.

295
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,240
And just like me,

296
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,000
you won't get hungry, die,

297
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,830
or get sick anymore.

298
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,830
Everything sounds awesome
in the Nine Heavens.

299
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,510
Mother, please go back

300
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,400
to heaven after I die.

301
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,790
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

302
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,550
