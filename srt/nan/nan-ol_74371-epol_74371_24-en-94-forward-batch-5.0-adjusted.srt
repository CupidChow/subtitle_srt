[Episode 24]

3
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,990
You, the Princess of Beidai,

4
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,770
slaughtered Imperial Guards for no reason.

5
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,419
Aren't you afraid
of His Majesty's punishment?

6
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:16,900
Would His Majesty really punish me

7
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,960
for the deaths of two lowly soldiers?

8
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,560
Ridiculous.

9
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,930
Besides,

10
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,900
if you die today,

11
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,020
no one will know I killed them.

12
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,579
You lured me here

13
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,790
just to kill me?

14
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,420
You're insane!

15
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,960
Didn't see

16
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,790
this coming
when you used all means to seduce

17
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,620
Young Commander Yan back then, huh?

18
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,740
Now,

19
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,579
I'm going to make you pay with your life

20
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,760
for all the shame

21
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,370
and neglect I've suffered

22
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,250
because of you.

23
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,770
Imagine how Yanchi

24
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,980
will treat you if you kill me.

25
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,050
You can't

26
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,980
intimidate me!

27
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,880
Your Highness!

28
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,750
Go after her!

29
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,180
Split up and get her!

30
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,810
Yes.

31
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,320
I don't care if she's alive or dead.

32
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,670
Bring that bitch to me!

33
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,460
-Yes.
-Yes.

34
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

35
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,980
You've come at the right time.

36
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,770
Has the Crown Prince

37
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,579
set off with the princes and princesses
from both countries?

38
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,410
They left more than two hours ago.

39
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,530
I wanted the Crown Prince

40
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,940
to smooth things over after you refused
to marry the Princess of Beidai,

41
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,880
but surprisingly,

42
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,170
he suggested going to enjoy the view
of plum blossoms at Southern Court.

43
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,900
I wonder if they've got

44
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,850
everything ready for their trip.

45
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,020
Sorry for causing you trouble,
Your Majesty.

46
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,310
So you know it.

47
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,140
Your public rejection of the marriage

48
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,820
nearly destroyed

49
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,650
your father's years of careful diplomacy
in the northwest.

50
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,760
If they're angry about this,

51
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,920
I don't mind leading troops
to take down Beidai and Xihan again.

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,030
Reckless words.

53
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,290
For this journey,

54
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,830
have we assigned additional guards?

55
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,350
I planned so,

56
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,270
but the Crown Prince said

57
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,090
they were only going to enjoy the scenery,

58
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,410
and with a peaceful mind,
there wouldn't be any danger.

59
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,940
So he rejected my proposal.

60
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,580
When I was still a Crown Prince,

61
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,390
I was cautious in everything.

62
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,950
If given a mission,

63
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,360
I would consider every detail

64
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,970
in case of any oversight

65
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,470
that might fail the duties
expected of the Crown Prince.

66
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,900
But Yan Che takes his role
as Crown Prince rather lightly.

67
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,770
Chi,

68
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,850
come.

69
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,580
Seven days later,

70
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,870
I

71
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,350
will go hunting
with those princes from the two states.

72
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,620
Do you know why I've entrusted

73
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,659
all security matters to you?

74
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,810
Zhou shares borders
with both Beidai and Xihan.

76
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,260
If anything happens

77
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,500
to their princes in our territory,

78
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,940
someone might take this chance

79
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,060
to stir up trouble.

80
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,700
So we must make sure nothing goes wrong

81
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,060
with the security for this hunt

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,390
and minimize the risks.

83
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,580
I've ordered to investigate

84
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,620
all staff coming with the envoys
from the two states

85
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,090
and set up security

86
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,580
within a hundred-li radius
around the hunting grounds

87
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,850
to avoid any unauthorized visitors.

88
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,650
If the Crown Prince

89
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,620
were half as vigilant as you,

90
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:17,740
I would

91
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,920
have much less to worry about.

92
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,530
But you've been keeping something from me.

93
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,110
Why?

94
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,650
Split up and search.

95
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,260
Yes.

96
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,500
Not until I read

97
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,700
the Yuzhou prefect's report did I learn

98
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,870
that the gold heist case was solved

99
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,490
with Miss Qin Wan's contribution.

100
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,070
Actually, that's not all.

101
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,970
The case of Qin An from Jingzhou,

102
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,650
the murder case of Song Rou,
daughter of the Duke of Song,

103
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,820
and the recent case
of the tailor assaulting a female resident

104
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,940
in the capital,
which the Crown Prince supervised,

105
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,600
were all solved
thanks to Miss Qin's expertise.

106
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,730
I didn't expect Miss Qin's forensic skills

107
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,410
to be this incredible.

108
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,530
Since Shen Yi...

109
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,620
The Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review

110
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,080
have had no more experts
skilled in autopsy.

111
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,320
As the saying goes,

112
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,730
talented people are one in ten thousand,

113
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,530
and one such person
can outweigh all treasures in the world.

114
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,050
But she's a woman.

115
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,730
What a pity.

116
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,730
If she's given

117
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,390
an important position,

118
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,460
some censors might accuse her
of disrupting court affairs, I'm afraid.

119
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,270
Not only might it
cause instability in the court,

120
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,930
but she would also have to endure
numerous rumors and slander

121
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,730
that might humiliate her

122
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,870
for the rest of her life.

123
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,290
I'm fed up with these clichés.

124
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,260
Why should women

125
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,900
be confined to their homes
to raise children only?

126
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,650
Why can't they make their mark
and build their careers?

127
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,650
I think some people are just jealous

128
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,850
and afraid that talented women
might outshine them,

129
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,310
so they came up
with these absurd arguments.

130
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,020
That speech of yours

131
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,700
is rather surprising.

132
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,730
It seems

133
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,530
that you're quite concerned
about Miss Qin Wan.

134
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,770
Do you have

135
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,530
some feelings for her?

136
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,380
This has nothing to do
with personal feelings.

137
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,909
I'm talking about justice.

138
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,940
Your Majesty,

139
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,620
as they say, old conventions stop

140
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,049
real genius from shining.

141
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,530
I hope you can put talent
above everything else

142
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,620
and give Miss Qin Wan a chance
to demonstrate her abilities

143
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,950
for the imperial court.

144
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,180
If you agree,

145
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,810
I can continue to employ her

146
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,290
as a secret strategist

147
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,050
to work for the Ministry of Justice.

148
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,250
A secret strategist?

149
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,750
Isn't that somewhat unfair to her?

150
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,950
From what I know of Miss Qin Wan,

151
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,380
she is only passionate
about medicine and forensics

152
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,290
and cares nothing for fame or fortune.

153
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,900
You're granting her biggest wish

154
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,630
if you allow her to practice it.

155
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,650
Then let it be as you suggest.

156
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,930
Let her serve as your strategist for now,

157
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,980
and when the time is right,

158
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,900
I will give her

159
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,050
a proper position.

160
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,290
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for granting me this sidekick.

161
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,860
I have always rewarded based on merit.

162
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,140
Quite fair.

163
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,450
Your Majesty,

164
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,440
the Southern Court guards
have returned with news

165
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,970
that Beidai's Crown Prince
has gone missing.

166
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,140
What?

167
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,560
How could such an absurd thing happen?

168
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,690
What is our Crown Prince doing?

169
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,740
What is Prince Cheng doing?

170
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,620
Our Crown Prince is leading
guards from both states

171
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,600
in search of him.

172
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,700
But it's getting dark.

173
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,650
If we don't increase our search forces,

174
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,340
spending the night in the wilderness

175
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,290
could endanger
the Beidai Crown Prince's life.

176
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,370
Chi, heed my order.

177
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,100
Yes.

178
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Take a team and search
the Southern Court right away.

179
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,050
You must find the Beidai Crown Prince.

180
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,020
You have one night

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,910
to find him

182
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,260
or his body!

183
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,380
This is truly

185
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,380
what I feared most

186
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,550
coming to pass.

187
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,770
It was you.

188
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,260
You must have secretly harmed
my Crown Prince Brother.

189
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,060
Stop making false accusations.

190
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,290
Today, my guards saw you

191
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,690
sneakily following my brother.

192
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,500
We happened to take the same path.

193
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,700
This bamboo grove in the Southern Court

194
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,940
doesn't belong to your Beidai.

195
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,080
If you can go there,

196
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,980
why can't I?

197
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,650
Stop!

198
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,180
You guys...

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,020
Do you think
that my brother's disappearance

200
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,100
can give your Xihan a chance to get

201
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,490
Zhou's Princess Zhen? Dream on!

202
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,530
As long as I'm here,

203
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,590
you won't succeed!

204
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,810
Commander Yan, my Crown Prince Brother
is Beidai's great warrior

205
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,020
who is battle-hardened with great prowess.

206
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,570
Someone must've set a trap secretly,

207
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,570
or how could he disappear
without a trace, his fate unknown?

208
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,030
Please, we need the truth.

209
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,970
-Chi.
-Chi.

210
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
We've searched everywhere

211
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,140
and found no one in the vicinity.

212
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,300
Does Crown Prince Yuan Hong
have any bodyguards with him?

213
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,770
I am Xu Chang.

214
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,770
I'm responsible
for the Crown Prince's safety.

215
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,380
The Crown Prince

216
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,530
was hunting a silver fox
for Princess Yan Zhen.

217
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,900
He found me annoying as I tried
to stop him from continuing the hunt,

218
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,590
so he sent me away.

219
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,550
This disaster has occurred

220
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,080
due to my negligence.

221
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,530
I deserve punishment.

222
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,410
Rest assured,

223
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
it's not a mere guard like you
who should be punished,

224
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,930
but the one responsible for protecting
the princes of both states—

225
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,100
Zhou's Crown Prince.

226
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,900
What does this have to do with me?

227
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,280
Chi,

228
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,410
where are the additional guards

229
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,940
supposed to be dispatched?

230
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,380
Prince Yi's heir, Yan Li,

231
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,630
follow me into the mountain

232
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,380
and lead the guards to look for
Crown Prince Yuan Hong.

233
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,020
His Majesty has ordered us
to find him or his body

234
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,620
within one night.

235
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,450
Understood.

236
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,250
I'm going too.

237
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,970
Me too.

238
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,900
Prince Yuan Rui, General Chang,

239
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,630
please wait in the plum forest.

240
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,930
Have one of Crown Prince Yuan Hong's

241
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,410
bodyguards lead the way.

242
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,790
Let's go.

243
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,820
Chi,

244
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,140
I haven't found anything on my side.

245
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,810
Master.

246
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,980
Master!

247
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,160
Miss Qin and two Imperial Guards

248
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,340
left the palace with Yuan Wu's maid

249
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,800
and haven't returned yet.

250
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,950
How dare she

251
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,080
lay a hand on Little Wan'er?

252
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,210
Does she want to die?

253
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,160
Chi,

254
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,220
Ning and I will go find Miss Qin Wan.

255
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,140
You continue searching
for Beidai's Crown Prince.

256
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,020
Wan never waits for doom
without doing anything.

257
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,140
You don't know her well

258
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,740
and might neglect
her means of saving herself.

259
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,220
Changfeng?

260
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,390
This is our Crown Prince's horse,
Changfeng.

261
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,450
It's wounded.

262
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,670
Commander Yan,

263
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,220
in no case would Changfeng
abandon its master

264
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,290
and escape alone.

265
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,980
His Highness must be in danger!

266
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,930
Please save our Crown Prince.

267
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,870
Chi,

268
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,690
what is this?

269
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,340
This is a gorgon leaf.

270
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,570
Gorgon plants grow in ponds and swamps.

271
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,900
This indicates that Changfeng

272
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,570
must've struggled
in a cluster of gorgon plants.

273
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,900
Horses are sharp and smart.

274
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,100
They're the best at sensing danger.

275
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,220
Changfeng risked entering
the gorgon plant cluster

276
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,740
definitely to save Yuan Hong.

277
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,200
Map of the Southern Court.

278
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,410
Here.

279
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,380
And here.

280
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,900
And this area.

281
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,900
These are all the ponds and swamps
near the Southern Court.

282
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,140
Check paths that are only wide enough

283
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,860
for a single horse to pass through.

284
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,410
If you find scrapes on the cliffside,

285
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,500
that's the right track.

286
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,260
Understood.

287
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
Don't worry, Chi.

288
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
Whether he's breathing or not,

289
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,290
we will definitely
bring Crown Prince Yuan Hong back.

290
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,140
Chi,

291
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,570
I'll go with you to find Little Wan'er.

292
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,380
You stay here.

293
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,130
If Yuan Wu comes back,

294
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,170
ground her here.

295
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,360
Okay.

296
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,050
I absolutely won't let her go.

297
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:32,980
Let's go.

298
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,780
Keep searching over there!

299
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,500
Get her!

300
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,530
Yan Chi,

301
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,570
I believe

302
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,240
you will find me.

303
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,570
We're near the swamp.

304
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,050
Everyone, search carefully!

305
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,720
Yes, sir.

306
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,330
Swamps are treacherous.

307
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,800
If Yuan Hong really fell into a swamp,

308
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,930
I'm afraid he wouldn't have survived.

309
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,930
Unless out of desperation,

310
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,330
who would hide in a swamp?

311
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,930
Someone must've set a trap
in secret and chosen

312
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,339
to kill Yuan Hong when our Crown Prince
was handling security.

313
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,099
Not sure
if they only meant to harm those two,

314
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,060
or if they wanted

315
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,780
to spark another war
between Zhou and Beidai,

316
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,010
killing two birds with one stone.

317
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,730
Whatever this person's purpose is,

318
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,540
harming Yuan Hong
would implicate the Crown Prince.

319
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,579
What's the difference?

320
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,930
That makes a huge difference.

321
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,300
If they went after our Crown Prince only,

322
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,540
it'd be someone from Zhou

323
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,180
who covets the throne.

324
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,210
If they schemed

325
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,010
to reignite a war between Zhou and Beidai,

326
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,010
then it was most likely done
by people from Xihan.

327
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,340
But if they tried to hit three targets

328
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,940
by dragging Xihan into this,

329
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,460
then this person must be

330
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,040
unbelievably ambitious.

331
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,300
Changfeng.

332
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,710
Why did you stop?

333
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,010
Changfeng.

334
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,830
Changfeng!

335
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,700
Follow them!

336
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,940
Over here!

337
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,640
Hurry and save him!

338
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,450

Come on.

341
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,860
Try this wild onion soup to warm you up.

342
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,980
Seeing you faint earlier

343
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,630
almost gave me a heart attack.

344
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,010
Thankfully, you saved me

345
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,960

Come on.

373
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,010
Didn't expect you

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,430
to know how to make these.

375
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,460
For countless battles in the wild,

376
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,860
it's an essential skill.

377
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
This one's not finished yet.

378
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,910
Come on.

379
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,670
Report!

380
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,340
Your Highness,

381
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,490
Crown Prince Yuan Hong has been found,

382
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,410
but with severe injuries.

383
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,780
Escort Miss Qin back home first.

384
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,900
I'll be right there.

385
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,030
Yes, Your Highness.

386
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,820
Severe injuries?

387
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,170
I'll go with you too.

388
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,100
But your legs...

389
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,030
Don't worry.

390
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,100
I'm fine now.

391
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
And I have you.

392
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,170
Beidai's Crown Prince
was gravely injured in our territory.

393
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,370
How could I just stand by and do nothing?

394
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,420
Okay.

395
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,780
My Crown Prince Brother
hasn't been found yet.

396
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,250
Why aren't you out searching for him?

397
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,730
Are you deliberately wasting time

398
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,930
to let my brother die?

399
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,280
Tell your Crown Prince

400
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,800
that if my brother doesn't return alive,

401
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,490
I will report it to my father

402
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,930
and lead troops south

403
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,250
to crush your Zhou!

404
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,100
Very well!

405
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,170
Our Shuoxi Army will be waiting for you.

406
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,860
How are you...

407
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,100
How am I still alive?

408
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,340
You should be grateful that I am.

409
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,650
I'll kill you!

410
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,790
Young Marshal,

411
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,820
my sister is losing it

412
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,250
due to our brother's disappearance.

413
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,170
Please don't take offense.

414
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,010
If my brother doesn't come back alive,

415
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,170
I'll fight you to the death!

416
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,170
No need for that.

417
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,520
Let's focus on saving his life.

418
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,300
Brother!

419
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,900
Brother!

420
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,820
Brother!

421
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,140
Brother!

422
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,900
Careful!

423
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,310
Keep crushing him like that,
and he really will die.

424
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,210
Miss Qin, please save him.

425
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,580
The wound
on Crown Prince Yuan Hong's chest

426
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,060
was caused by an arrow.

427
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,730
The arrow shaft was cut off,

428
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,780
yet the arrowhead remains inside his body.

429
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,450
To treat Crown Prince Yuan Hong's wound,

430
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,340
the first step

431
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,290
is to remove the arrowhead.

432
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,860
Crown Prince Yuan Hong
has already lost too much blood

433
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,190
and cannot take more.

434
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,760
Even if it had been treated
right after the injury,

435
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,150
no one would dare to cut open his chest

436
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,060
to remove the arrowhead.

437
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,460
You good-for-nothings.

438
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,380
If you can't save
Crown Prince Yuan Hong's life,

439
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,460
you can only apologize to my father
by killing yourselves!

440
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,130
Get lost.

441
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,520
Even if Yuan Hong really dies here,

442
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,060
it will take time for the news
to reach his state.

443
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,620
We might as well mobilize
the Shuoxi Army in advance

444
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,550
to guard against Beidai's attack.

445
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,470
The war clouds are gathering.

446
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,620
Brother,

447
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,700
what's the use of being scared?

448
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,450
Is there anything else on your mind
besides fighting and killing?

449
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,510
But this incident

450
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,780
was caused by your negligence.

451
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,250
I'm just worried about

452
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,820
the grave consequences
if Yuan Hong truly cannot recover

453
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,150
from his severe wounds.

454
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,710
We might as well plan ahead

455
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,730
to prevent Zhou
from falling into a disadvantage.

456
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,730
Brother,

457
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,770
you've misunderstood my good intentions.

458
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,030
Miss Qin,

459
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,490
we've fed him the anesthetic
and life-preserving decoction.

460
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,410
Get ready to extract

461
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,300
the arrowhead in a while.

462
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,860
Yes.

463
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,820
Crown Prince Yuan Hong
has taken the medicine.

464
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,020
We'll remove the arrow
once the anesthetic takes effect.

465
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,780
This is animal bait I found in his hair.

466
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,860
For this outing at the Southern Court,

467
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,010
the surrounding areas had been cleaned up.

468
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,490
How could any hunter sneak in
to spread baits?

469
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,850
This bait was found close to his scalp.

470
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,760
It couldn't have gotten there by accident.

471
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,630
Looks more like

472
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,580
someone rubbed this bait
into his hair,

473
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,250
so it remained there until just now.

474
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,250
Someone wanted wild animals
to feed on him to destroy the evidence.

475
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,860
This is clearly premeditated murder.

476
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,900
How vicious.

477
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,140
But there's one thing
I still don't understand.

478
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,060
Weren't you all
appreciating flowers together?

479
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,990
How did Crown Prince Yuan Hong
end up in danger alone?

480
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,370
All because of that snow fox
offered by Xihan.

481
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,750
Princess, look.

482
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,880
Is it too warm?

483
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,400
It ran away!

484
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,350
It is a heartless beast after all.

485
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,710
I'll catch it for you, Princess,

486
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,910
and teach it a lesson.

487
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,090
Get me a horse!

488
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,060
Be careful, Brother!

489
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,780
The snow fox ran wild?

490
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,650
W-What's wrong?

491
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,840
It stinks?

492
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,900
I only held it for a moment!

493
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,280
Did it defecate on me?

494
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,300
Now I see.

495
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,340
Crown Prince Yuan Hong
chased after the snow fox,

496
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,930
unwittingly giving the assailant
a chance to strike.

497
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,970
After severely wounding
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

498
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,140
the attacker then used animal bait

499
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,800
to attract wild beasts
to destroy the evidence.

500
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,120
Someone capable of such a vicious scheme

501
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,410
certainly won't stop here.

502
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,060
As long as Yuan Hong is alive,

503
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,790
he remains in constant danger.

504
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,450
Only by catching the real culprit

505
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,010
can his safety be secured

506
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,810
and the border remain peaceful.

507
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,210
Leave this matter to us.

508
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,070
Just focus on treating Yuan Hong.

509
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,500
I'll go check on him.

510
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,820
Yue Ning,

511
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,870
keep a close eye on Yuan Wu.

512
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,960
Bai Feng,

513
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,210
guard this place.

514
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,890
I...

515
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,540
Yan Li,

516
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,820
take me to where you found Yuan Hong.

517
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,690
Okay.

518
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,800
This is where we found him.

519
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,240
Let's go check it out.

520
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,290
Apply acupuncture

521
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,540
to stop the bleeding.

522
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,820
Chi,

523
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,010
look at the hoof prints here.

524
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:47,930
Yan Li.

525
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,560
Horse-tripping rope.

526
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,740
Sure enough, someone intended to kill
Crown Prince Yuan Hong.

527
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,860
Do you have any suspects in mind?

528
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,450
Based on our investigation of the envoy,

529
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,250
I already have a suspect in mind.

530
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,230
However,

531
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,920
without sufficient evidence,

532
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,780
accusing anyone could be

533
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,310
seen as false allegations.

534
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,650
No matter who the assassin is,

535
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,910
this incident occurred in our territory

536
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,820
and involves our diplomatic relations,

537
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,620
so we must proceed with caution.

538
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,290
But any further delay

539
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,970
can endanger Crown Prince Yuan Hong.

540
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,410
I...

541
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,420
I have a plan

542
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,510
to catch the culprit in the act.

543
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,600
Hope you can approve, Your Highness.

544
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,650
Don't cause
any unnecessary harm to anyone.

545
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,170
Just tell me, yes or no!

546
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,820
What a hassle.

547
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,100
What medicine is Little Wan'er decocting?

548
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,410
Smells spicy and foul.

549
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,340
She called it fumigation,
which could bring down

550
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,540
the high fever first.

551
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,950
Then it all depends on
that bowl of medicine to save his life.

552
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,490
Never thought
that a dignified general of Beidai

553
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,570
would do something so underhanded.

554
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,070
Suicidal attempt?

555
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,380
No way since I'm here.

556
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,770
Your Majesty,

557
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,450
Xu Chang used Poison Arrow Wood,

558
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,250
highly toxic,

559
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,730
typically applied
to arrowheads for hunting.

560
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,010
Once ingested by a man, it'll cause

561
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,450
the intestines to turn black
and stick together.

562
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,380
Constant abdominal pain will kill the man.

563
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,410
Xu Chang,

564
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,670
you're accused of poisoning and murdering
Crown Prince Yuan Hong

565
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,620
with both witnesses and evidence.

566
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,150
What else do you have to say?

567
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,420
You were also behind the snow fox's
frightened escape, weren't you?

568
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,340
What are you doing?

569
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,820
You rubbed the wolverine's scent

570
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,880
on Princess Yongning deliberately.

571
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,340
Wolverines love hunting young foxes.

572
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,010
Is it too warm?

573
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,780
You used this scent
to drive the snow fox mad

574
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,450
in order

575
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,970
to lure your Crown Prince out,

576
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,630
so you could assassinate him.

577
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,170
Xu Chang,

578
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,730
it's said you're defiant
and have plenty of enemies.

579
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,110
You got where you are now

580
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,210
all thanks to
Crown Prince Yuan Hong's support.

581
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,610
Would you like to explain

582
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,580
why you tried to murder him?

583
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,210
Tell me

584
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,420
who on earth ordered you to do this!

585
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,730
Brother!

586
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,780
Are you alright now?

587
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,260
Brother,

588
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,270
how do you feel?

589
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,489
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

590
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,570
no need for formalities.

591
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,489
It's okay.

592
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,020
General Xu,

593
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,340
when you shot that arrow at me,
I really wanted to ask you

594
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,050
why you tried to harm me.

595
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,699
That shot failed,

596
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,969
and you even tried to poison my medicine.

597
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,739
Xu Chang,

598
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,610
I've treated you so well, haven't I?

599
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,880
I

600
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,300
deserve to die for my crimes.

601
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,780
I

602
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,159
have nothing to say in my defense.

603
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,190
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

604
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:58,960
I have confirmed intelligence.

605
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,739
Before he received your support,

606
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:01,790
Xu Chang

607
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,090
had already been bankrolled by someone
of high position and power.

608
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,090
And if this person
were to become the Crown Prince,

609
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,010
he could earn the merit
of backing the future emperor.

610
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,090
Am I right,

611
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,790
Prince Yuan Rui?

612
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,860
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

613
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,220
To cover up your crime,

614
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,640
you scattered animal bait

615
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,570
on the dying Crown Prince Yuan Hong

616
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,030
just to attract wild beasts to devour him.

617
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,780
Yuan Rui,

618
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,090
was it really you?

619
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,450
Rui,

620
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,830
say something.

621
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,880
Explain yourself.

622
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,570
Do you hear me?

623
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,180
Rui,

624
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,220
say something!

625
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Why?

626
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,610
Why did you do this?

627
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,140
To become the Crown Prince!

628
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,560
Were it not for your incapability

629
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,260
to handle Yan Chi and Qin Wan,

630
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,900
Yuan Hong would have been dead already!

631
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Shameless!

632
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,760
Yuan Rui,

633
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,910
I've treated you with deep
and sincere brotherhood for years.

634
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,290
Never did I expect you to be

635
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,090
such a vicious and despicable hypocrite!

636
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,820
Were it not for your stupidity
and incompetence,

637
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,490
our Beidai wouldn't have kept

638
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,380
losing territory to the Shuoxi Army!

639
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,910
If Wu weren't this useless,

640
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,090
she would have won over
Young Commander Yan of the Shuoxi Army!

641
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,050
I also wished for brotherly harmony.

642
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,380
But being a nice brother

643
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,100
means I can't be an emperor.

644
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,660
The foolish yield to the talented;
the capable take power.

645
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,120
This is the natural order!

646
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,130
You think too highly of yourself.

647
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,930
A kingdom without unity,

648
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,610
a ruler without benevolence,

649
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,270
and people unable to survive.

650
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,970
If you can't bring the court closer
to the people and settle people down,

651
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,370
even killing 100 crown princes won't help!

652
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,340
Using the national interest

653
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,470
to justify your greed and disloyalty,

654
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,880
you're nothing but a hypocritical schemer
trying to steal the throne.

655
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,650
Enough.

656
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,610
Take Yuan Rui

657
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,800
and Xu Chang

658
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,050
back to the Court of Judicial Review
for detention!

659
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,110
Yes, Your Majesty!

660
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,380
You don't deserve to be the Crown Prince.

661
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,010
Regarding this matter,

662
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,820
I will personally write
to inform the Emperor of Beidai.

663
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,200
The infighting between brothers

664
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,760
is truly regrettable,

665
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,490
but at least we've figured out the truth.

666
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,520
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,
don't let it hurt yourself too much.

667
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,920
This concerns Beidai's internal affairs,

668
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,300
and I shouldn't overstep my boundaries.

669
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,200
Once your wounds have healed,

670
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,840
you may personally take those two men

671
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,300
back to Beidai for punishment.

672
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,370
Thank you

673
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,170
for your consideration, Your Majesty.

674
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,790
Your Highness, your speech

675
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,800
is truly thought-provoking.

676
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,660
After this incident,

677
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,820
I don't think I'm worthy of courting
your Princess Zhen for marriage.

678
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,210
Upon my return,

679
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,100
I will devote myself to careful governance

680
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,670
so as to maintain our peaceful borders

681
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,620
and mutual prosperity.

682
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,900
That is excellent.

683
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,240
Guards,

684
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,920
escort Crown Prince Yuan Hong
to rest and recover.

685
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,570
Everyone else may leave.

686
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,760
Li and Chi, you two stay.

687
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,910
The fight
for the Beidai Crown Prince's position

688
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,610
occurred within their imperial family.

689
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,520
It's something

690
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,560
quite upsetting for me to see.

691
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,840
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

692
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,010
Chi and I absolutely have no desire
to be the Crown Prince.

693
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,000
We mean it

694
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,090
seriously.

695
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,460
It's easy to say that

696
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,120
when you're not involved.

697
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,770
Liu Yun just submitted a memorial,

698
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,530
stating that due to poor health,

699
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,720
he requested to return
to Xihan ahead of schedule.

700
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,780
He no longer intends
to marry Princess Zhen either.

701
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,220
This Third Prince of Xihan

702
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,970
is certainly a perceptive and clever man.

703
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,970
The marriage alliance

704
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,340
was to stabilize the borders
between our three kingdoms.

705
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,300
Given Beidai's infighting,
they're no longer a threat.

706
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,930
So our goal has been achieved.

707
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,930
It's also better for Princess Zhen.

708
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,380
All thanks to Miss Qin Wan,

709
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,260
who saved the Beidai Crown Prince's life

710
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,540
and helped

711
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,190
capture the real culprits.

712
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,660
In view of her great contributions
in a row,

713
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,220
I don't even know
how to reward her properly.

714
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,360
That's easy.

715
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,900
Your Majesty, you previously rewarded her
with gold and jewels.

716
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,030
This time, you could grant her a title.

717
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,670
I have no particular friendship
with any of you.

718
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,660
And I'm not marrying
the princess either now.

719
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,400
Why

720
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,700
would you all come to see me off?

721
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,020
By imperial command.

722
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,150
I'm just here for fun.

723
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,360
I'm here
because you didn't hurt Princess Zhen.

724
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,630
Actually, I also had
no good intentions before.

725
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,600
When I followed Yuan Hong,

726
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,080
I once considered

727
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,530
killing him with Beidai's arrows

728
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,840
and framing their own people.

729
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,930
I just didn't expect them
to have internal strife,

730
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,830
allowing me

731
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,790
to reap the benefits easily.

732
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,160
You wear makeup

733
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,210
to hide your severe lung disease.

734
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,050
You still refuse my treatment?

735
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,110
I can extend your life for 3 to 5 years.

736
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,300
To live those extra 3 to 5 years,

737
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,670
how much bitter medicine must I take?

738
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,260
Not worth it.

739
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,130
Now that Yuan Hong is severely injured,

740
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,260
Beidai will surely decline for years.

741
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,700
Our Xihan people

742
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,700
can finally catch our breath.

743
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,180
Thank you all for your mercy

744
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,320
in sparing my life.

745
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Don't mention it.

746
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,550
It's also mercy for the border civilians.

747
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,900
Here comes the imperial decree!

748
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,260
Qin Wan, receive the imperial decree.

749
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:48,970
The decree states,

750
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,090
"Qin Wan, the eldest legitimate daughter
of Qin Liang from the Qin family,

751
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,660
is virtuous and prudent in character,

752
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,130
diligent and gentle in manner,

753
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,610
harmonious and pure in spirit,

754
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,010
kind and benevolent in nature,

755
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,410
with remarkable talents.

756
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,900
She has won my favor

757
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,050
and is hereby bestowed
the title of Princess Yongci.

758
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,260
Let it be announced far and wide

759
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,410
so that all may know. By imperial order."

760
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,780
Tell her to receive the decree!

761
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,750
Please wait a moment, Mr. Yuan.

762
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,140
Princess Yongci
seems too exhilarated to respond.

763
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,740
Hurry and accept the decree!

764
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,850
Thank you for the decree.

765
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,820
Get up, get up.

766
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,720
Little Wan'er!

767
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,800
His Majesty also permitted
our stay at the Ministry of Justice.

768
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,060
Our revenge is within reach now.

769
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,170
From today onwards,

770
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,830
I can truly stand
shoulder to shoulder with you.

771
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,150
D-Don't look at what you shouldn't see.

772
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,220
It's the same for you then.
