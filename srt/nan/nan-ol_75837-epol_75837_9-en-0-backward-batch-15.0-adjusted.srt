(To Ye Haitang)

2
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:30,600
Yu Nian.

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,079
Thank you.

4
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:33,960
You may leave.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,880
Is it from your dad?

6
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,672
(Tang Yixun)

7
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,879
Is your dad named Tang Yixun?

8
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:43,432
=Twelve Letters=

00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:47,611
=Episode 9=
(If...)

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,120
How is it? Are you cold?

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,439
Help me up.

12
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't even stand up.

13
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,919
I'm frozen stiff.

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,840
Frozen stiff?

15
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,960
You insisted on coming.

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,439
What if you catch a cold,

17
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,199
or get scared?

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,000
Indeed. I might catch a cold.

19
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,960
But I get scared?

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Impossible.

21
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,639
I've seen everything.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,759
We've waited all night,

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,120
yet nothing comes

24
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,039
from the mailbox.

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,199
What does Yu Nian mean?

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,919
What's the wrong with this mailbox?

27
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,960
So spooky.

28
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,719
Look.

29
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,120
Nothing.

30
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,280
It doesn't occur every night.

31
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,599
Depends on the situation.

32
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,159
Listen to me.

33
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,039
You go back first.

34
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,159
I'll keep watch for you.

35
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,800
I'll tell you once letters come.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,580
Then you come back.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,199
Well...

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,840
I'll go take a nap.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,199
Message me anytime.

40
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,479
Give out
missing person notices tomorrow.

41
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,560
Three hundred.

42
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,479
Okay.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,639
Keep watch.

44
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,240
A stray cat?

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,639
What's that noise?

46
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,039
It occurs.

47
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,360
I told you.

48
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,759
Are you okay?

49
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,199
Shen Cheng.

50
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,240
We got a reply.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,879
What does it mean?

52
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,368
(My kid, let's go to Shiqiao today.
For fish cakes.)

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,120
Are you sure

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,399
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

55
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,319
Yes.

56
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,560
Which means

57
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,720
that must be Ye Haitang from 1991.

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,480
Yes.

59
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,360
My mom is still alive.

60
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,040
She lives in the year 1991 over there.

61
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,439
300 missing person notices

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,319
were all

63
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,360
posted up.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,639
Exhausted.

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,839
Listen up.

66
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,920
When I came back,

67
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,199
that woman was still there.

68
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,120
Listen,

69
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,240
your friend

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,079
is really something.

71
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,519
She's pregnant,

72
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
but not fragile at all.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Though she likes to brag,

74
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,120
claiming she's bold.

75
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,800
But when the letter came,

76
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,120
she passed out from fright.

77
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,439
Passed out?

78
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,439
Is she okay?

79
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,240
Is the baby alright?

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,720
Yes. I took her to the hospital.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,480
The doctor said...

82
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,040
Are you sure?

83
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,079
She just got scared. Okay.

84
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,879
The baby is fine.

85
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,040
Are you crazy?

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,360
Why tell others about this matter?

87
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,839
What do you mean?

88
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,160
Aren't we in the same team?

89
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,240
Shen...

90
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Shen Cheng!

91
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,079
What's wrong with him?

92
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,439
Why slammed the door?

93
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,720
Weren't you calling us

94
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
scammers?

95
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,639
Now you're worried about leaks?

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,800
How ridiculous!

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,639
Why slammed the door?

98
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,759
Where's your manners?

99
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,040
My mom says it would get bad luck!

100
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,759
Enough.

101
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,519
Mind your manners.

102
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,639
Don't blame him.

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,519
What's wrong?

104
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,560
Is he your boss?

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,160
His mom's gone.

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,040
Where to?

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,240
She's passed away.

108
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,160
Don't blame him.

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,199
Dead?

110
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,639
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
I'm really sorry.

112
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,800
I didn't know.

113
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,160
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,199
I noticed he was acting different.

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,519
Losing his mom must be heartbroken.

116
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,120
Alright. Stop it.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,920
Wait,

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,560
we just received a letter.

119
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,120
19 years old.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
That must be his mom.

121
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,639
Cheng.

122
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,120
Don't be sad.

123
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,920
Come out.

124
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
She's still alive.

125
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,199
She's living in the other world.

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,000
Stop it.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,720
Come out and discuss

128
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,879
how to reply the letter.

129
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:15,848
(Avoid him now.)

130
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,839
What does it mean?

131
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,199
(He'll put you in danger.)
He'll put you in danger?

132
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,959
Give me.

133
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,519
I'll write.

134
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,279
Give me the letter!

135
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,279
Shen Cheng!

136
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:28,759
What?

137
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,439
Shen Cheng, explain yourself!

138
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,639
That letter isn't just yours.

139
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,399
Calm down.

140
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,000
Shen Cheng!

141
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,040
Careful.

142
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,639
Stop!

143
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,160
Careful.

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,160
Shen Cheng!

145
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,639
Keep your voice down.

146
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,439
Ma'am.

147
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,680
Don't provoke him.

148
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,639
Let him write what he wants.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
Don't delay important matters.

150
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,400
(Police)

151
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,079
This is where you used to live.

152
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,360
Do you remember?

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,639
Yes.

154
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,080
I used to live here.

155
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,120
We went to investigate.

156
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,159
Some old neighbors

157
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,600
remember your current father.

158
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,480
He returned a year before you moved.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,960
A year before?

160
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,360
That's him, right?

161
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,679
That's my father when he was young.

162
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,360
His name is Tang Yixun.

163
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,720
In 1991,

164
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,639
he was imprisoned for manslaughter.

165
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,200
Due to good behavior,

166
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,399
he was transferred to

167
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
Yu Zhiyong's prison for hit-and-run.

168
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,200
They became cellmates

169
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,200
and grew very close.

170
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,039
Later, Yu Zhiyong

171
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,480
fell ill

172
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,799
and died in prison.

173
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,399
I think he received

174
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,799
Yu Zhiyong's dying wish

175
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,399
to go to your hometown

176
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,519
and care for you and your grandma.

177
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,960
Just...

178
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,759
Just because of a dying wish?

179
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,799
This seems the most likely reason.

180
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
But first, we need to find him.

181
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,559
We found his identity.

182
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,679
That simplifies things.

183
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,080
We'll contact you

184
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,039
once we have updates.

185
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,480
Okay?

186
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,840
This mailbox stays,

187
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,159
while people come and go.

188
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,679
Everyone who sits here freezes up.

189
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,919
Bro.

190
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,600
Put this on.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,799
You'll catch a cold.

192
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,960
Yu Nian told me everything.

193
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,919
Sorry to hear that.

194
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,399
I don't know how to comfort you.

195
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,440
You must have

196
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
gone through a lot.

197
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,360
I won't ask further

198
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,679
to spare you more distress.

199
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,159
Go back soon.

200
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:45,840
It's freezing.

201
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,120
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

202
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,320
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

203
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,600
Fairly well.

204
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,759
We interacted for months.

205
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,600
What kind of person is he?

206
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,399
He?

207
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,759
An old man.

208
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,159
An old folk.

209
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,159
He sat here every day.

210
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,440
Quite stubborn.

211
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,399
Just like you.

212
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,840
He brought me steamed buns twice.

213
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,039
I think

214
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,720
he's a good person.

215
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,440
It's freezing.

216
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,600
You should go back soon.

217
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,000
Bye-bye.

218
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:00,631
(Ye Haitang's personal information)

219
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:09,896
(Middle school, Dropout)

220
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,639
He sat by the mailbox all night.

221
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,159
Just sat there wide-eyed.

222
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,240
I worried he'd freeze.

223
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,600
How do you guys handle the cold so well?

224
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
I'll go check on him.

225
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
He doesn't let me reply now.

226
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,600
What if he gets a reply?

227
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,360
I'll join him.

228
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,679
Coming.

229
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:29,799
Coming.

230
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,879
You'll break the door.

231
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,679
Bro.

232
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,960
Got a reply?

233
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,399
Freezing cold?

234
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,159
Thank you.

235
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:41,879
No problem.

236
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,519
Where to?

237
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,039
What happened?

238
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,799
Leaving now?

239
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,919
He just left?

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
How could he just leave?

241
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,840
Wait.

242
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,919
Where are you going?

243
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll follow him.

244
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,639
Police only tells him

245
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,600
about updates.

246
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,159
I need

247
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,200
to follow him.

248
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,399
He doesn't tell you?

249
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,879
He's immediate family.

250
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,879
I'm at a disadvantage now.

251
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,080
Inform Miaomiao for me.

252
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,279
I'm leaving Beixing to you.

253
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,539
Leave it to you, Quan.

254
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,279
I'm leaving.

255
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,200
You got this!

256
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,759
Wait...

257
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,399
You...

258
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,519
Leave it to me?

259
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,039
Can I handle it?

260
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,840
Well...

261
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,279
Such a huge responsibility.

262
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,080
I'll handle it.

263
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,360
This time,

264
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,279
why did you come back?

265
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,679
I know your concerns.

266
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,519
I have one goal,

267
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,440
to find my dad.

268
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,879
If he's done something wrong,

269
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,159
I won't protect him.

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
My mom's resume shows

271
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,399
she quit senior year

272
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:45,544
and didn't take the college exam.

273
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,120
I'll find people

274
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,639
who knew about this.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,720
Which year?

276
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,808
The year Tang Yixun committed the crime.

277
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,039
Did you find anyone?

278
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:02,664
(Unknown caller)

279
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,440
Hello.

280
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,759
Hello.

281
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,279
Are you Ye Haitang's son?

282
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,759
This is Tan Xin.

283
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,080
Ye Haitang

284
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,799
was hindered by that case.

285
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,639
Tang Yixun's case?

286
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,639
Ye Haitang was involved too?

287
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
The town had all kinds of rumors.

288
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,000
Some said

289
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,279
Tang Yixun killed for Ye Haitang.

290
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,799
Others claimed

291
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,919
Ye Haitang did the killing,

292
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,399
and Tang Yixun took the blame for her.

293
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,639
Anyway,

294
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm certain

295
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,679
Tang Yixun

296
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,399
would never harm Ye Haitang.

297
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,240
Why are you so certain?

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,799
They were my students.

299
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,319
When Tang Yixun was in prison,

300
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,960
he wrote me a letter.

301
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,039
Said he couldn't burden
Ye Haitang anymore,

302
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,119
or tarnish her life further.

303
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,960
He begged me to help her
retake the twelfth grade.

304
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,000
Make sure she can get into college

305
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,839
and leave Meiwan safely.

306
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,519
After she got into college,

307
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,039
then we lost contact.

308
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,960
Well,

309
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,200
about that case,

310
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
do you recall any other details?

311
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,079
Time.

312
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,519
It should be

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
November,

314
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,400
around the end of the month,

315
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,000
30th.

316
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,559
Do you know the deceased's name?

317
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,319
Someone mentioned his name.

318
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,359
But it sounded unfamiliar to me.

319
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,759
So I forgot over time.

320
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,799
My apologies.

321
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,680
Don't mind it.

322
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,839
Please think carefully

323
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,000
if there is anyone else

324
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,799
who was close to them.

325
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,599
For example,

326
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,440
friends, family members,

327
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,400
or classmates from their class.

328
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,480
Anything.

329
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,920
Anything.

330
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,559
Whatever works.

331
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,000
Xun

332
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,599
was an orphan.

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,599
He had a buddy named Zhang Hao
since childhood.

334
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,160
I saw him a few years ago.

335
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,160
Not sure if he's still in Pushui.

336
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,359
His contact...

337
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:13,799
Yes.

338
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,440
Do you have it?

339
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,880
Well, I need to look for it

340
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,680
when I get home.

341
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,599
I'll send it to you if found.

342
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,680
Great, thank you.

343
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,759
Thank you.

344
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,920
Grandma!

345
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,279
Grandma!

346
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,799
Xixi.

347
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,720
Xixi is here.

348
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,920
You got a red flower award?

349
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,559
Look, Grandma.

350
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,039
Hello, you two.

351
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,400
Hello.

352
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,799
- Mom.
- Son.

353
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,920
This is my son.

354
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:40,599
Hello.

355
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,400
Miss Tan,

356
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,680
sorry for taking up your time.

357
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:46,680
Thank you.

358
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,160
Not at all.

359
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,440
Here's our address

360
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,640
and our contacts.

361
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,000
Right.

362
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,039
If you recall anything else

363
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,200
or find Zhang Hao's contacts,

364
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,359
please tell us.

365
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,599
Contact us anytime.

366
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:58,960
Okay.

367
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,799
- Anytime.
- Okay.

368
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,079
I will.

369
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:01,960
Thank you.

370
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:02,720
- Bye.
- Thanks.

371
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,240
Let's go, Xixi.

372
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's go.

373
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Now you know my dad isn't a bad person?

374
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,880
It doesn't matter anymore.

375
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,359
I want to know

376
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,759
what they went through back then

377
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,920
that they became like this.

378
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,799
If everything hadn't happened,

379
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,880
would it have been different?

380
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,599
(Ye Haitang.)

381
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,480
(I'm your son Shen Cheng.)

382
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,319
(I don't know
how to describe my feeling now,)

383
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:55,000
(or explain what's happening.)

384
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,200
(But please believe what I say.)

385
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,039
(In 2026,)

386
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,759
(something terrible happened.)

387
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,440
(I want to know in 1991,)

388
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,640
(if you are doing well.)

389
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,160
(Is there someone
named Tang Yixun around you?)

390
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,119
(Whatever your relationship is,)

391
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,680
(please)

392
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,119
(avoid him now.)

393
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,079
(He'll put you in danger.)

394
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,200
(Believe me, Mom.)

395
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
My son?

396
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,680
You have a son?

397
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,279
Why am I involved?

398
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,799
Why must you avoid me?

399
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,480
Why did he say I'd put you in danger?

400
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,079
How is that possible?

401
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,759
What does it mean?

402
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
Wait, who is this person anyway?

403
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,799
Why should we believe him?

404
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,880
He claims he's your son...

405
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,880
Your son's surname is Shen?

406
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:38,920
So his dad is also a Shen.

407
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,799
Who's his father then?

408
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,319
Shen Xiaojun?

409
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:43,960
Impossible.

410
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,400
You and Shen Xiaojun are at odds.

411
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,319
How is that possible?

412
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Wait, where am I?

413
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
Am I dead?

414
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,759
Impossible.

415
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,360
If I had died,

416
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,759
I wouldn't write you a love letter.

417
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,559
They wouldn't write

418
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,519
to let you avoid me.

419
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,319
Wait.

420
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,400
Let's calm down.

421
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,839
The letter says

422
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,440
your son's surname is Shen, Shen Cheng.

423
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,279
Told you to avoid me,

424
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,279
I'd put you in danger.

425
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,039
Why would we believe his words?

426
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,799
Didn't you say

427
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,880
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

428
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,480
Right.

429
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,200
Look, the handwriting matches.

430
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
So this was written by Shen Cheng.

431
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:21,920
But there's no way

432
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,880
anyone else knows this.

433
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,279
I didn't even tell my grandma.

434
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,319
Wait, does this mean

435
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Yu Nian is your mother?

436
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,200
My mom is Wu Fengying.

437
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,559
Wait, this is so confusing.

438
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,440
None of these names match up.

439
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,640
They mentioned someone earlier...

440
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,279
Yu Zhiyong.

441
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,759
Who's this Yu Zhiyong?

442
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,039
No idea.

443
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,519
Then why did they

444
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,319
write these letters?

445
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,720
Told you to avoid me,

446
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,039
and I'd put you in danger?

447
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,599
What would happen

448
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,519
to us in 2026

449
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,240
has anything to do with us now?

450
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,480
Put this inside.

451
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,480
Tang.

452
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,079
Tang.

453
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,599
The test papers...

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,680
It's fine.

455
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,160
Just test papers. Let them be.

456
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,200
What's wrong?

457
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
This house

458
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,200
leaks every time it rains.

459
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,279
Xun.

460
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,480
It's okay. Really.

461
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,720
I'll rewrite them.

462
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,839
Tang.

463
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,400
I'm sorry.

464
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,880
Nothing.

465
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,079
It's no big deal.

466
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,079
I thought about it all night.

467
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,440
I must've done something wrong.

468
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,960
Nonsense.

469
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,759
Think about it.

470
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,039
If I did nothing wrong,

471
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,960
I'd be by your side

472
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,400
and they wouldn't make you leave me.

473
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,640
Don't overthink it.

474
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,839
We don't know what's happening.

475
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,519
Tang, I mean...

476
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
If one day,

477
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,480
I really put you in danger,

478
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,079
just run away if you can.

479
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,799
Time apart is nothing.

480
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,480
If I'm alive,

481
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,680
I'll come find you.

482
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,079
You won't.

483
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
Once we figure this out,

484
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,680
we'll be safe.

485
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Let's tidy up first.

486
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,359
Tang.

487
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,000
I'll get more tarp from the market.

488
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,880
I'll go with you.

489
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:51,839
The mailbox?

490
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Where's it?

491
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,880
Sir.

492
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,440
Sir.

493
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,480
Where's the mailbox?

494
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,480
Mailbox?

495
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,160
Isn't it there?

496
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,400
- It's gone.
- It's gone!

497
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:10,960
Probably washed away.

498
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,680
What?

499
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,039
Xun!

500
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:14,880
No, no!

501
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:15,920
Kid, get back here!

502
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,000
Be careful. It's dangerous!

503
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,440
Xun, come up here!

504
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,319
Tang, don't get down!

505
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,960
Come up! Forget the mailbox!

506
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,839
Xun, come up now!

507
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,720
Xun, come up here!

508
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,839
- Come up!
- Xun!

509
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,799
Just let it be.

510
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,920
Why risk your life for it?

511
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,000
Tang.

512
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,359
Be careful, Xun.

513
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,599
Careful.

514
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,320
I'll go look for it.

515
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,039
It's raining heavily.

516
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,559
Don't go out.

517
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,200
I need to find that mailbox.

518
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,599
How can I reply without it?

519
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,880
Why did the mailbox

520
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,160
suddenly vanish?

521
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,880
It's raining heavily.

522
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,720
It's an accident.

523
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,519
But the mailbox vanished!

524
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,559
I have to ask them

525
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,119
why they told you to avoid me

526
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,680
and what dangers you might be in.

527
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,480
I know nothing!

528
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,279
Xun.

529
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,480
We can't figure out what happens

530
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,480
with just some words.

531
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,720
Let's go look for it tomorrow.

532
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,200
We won't be apart.

533
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,680
Never.

534
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Okay.

535
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,319
I'll look for it tomorrow.

536
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,000
Every day.

537
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,640
Meiwan is not that big.

538
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,359
I believe I can find it.

539
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,480
The Billiards is ready.

540
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,640
And Cha is back on his feet.

541
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,079
Why doesn't Bao

542
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,960
leave you alone?

543
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
What did Qiang tell you that day?

544
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,759
You still go collect debts for them?

545
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,079
As long as we don't work for them,

546
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,720
they can't control us.

547
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Cha.

548
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,400
The rain's stopped.

549
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,799
Take Zhenzhu home.

550
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
Don't come over lately.

551
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,039
Tell Xun the same.

552
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,480
We're different from them.

553
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,599
We can still avoid them.

554
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,799
Go.

555
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:42,856
(Buddies Billiards)

556
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,359
Qiang, the door is locked.

557
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:57,960
No one's there.

558
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,839
This sign can only fool you.

559
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,920
You idiots.

560
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:06,632
(Temporarily Closed)

561
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,240
Fine.

562
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,759
Li Chadong.

563
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,839
Got guts.

564
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,680
Qiang.

565
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,200
They're trying to defy us.

566
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,960
Granny, I will restock for you later.

567
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,559
Alright.

568
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,680
Did Cha contact you?

569
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,599
What should we do?

570
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
Just listen to him.

571
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,599
Don't go over there lately.

572
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,440
If you see Qiang or Fat Dog,

573
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,599
avoid them.

574
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,559
Avoid them?

575
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,559
For how long?

576
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Shut down
both the Billiards and video parlor?

577
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,599
If we don't,

578
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,839
we'd just earn money for them.

579
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,240
Better do manual labor

580
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,039
than that,

581
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:20,680
right?

582
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,319
What a curse

583
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,559
to encounter those scumbags.

584
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,519
We can't even

585
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,160
get rid of them.

586
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,039
Get rid of them?

587
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,599
Just smashing them.

588
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:39,920
Alright.

589
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,839
Xun.

590
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,480
You go back to school.

591
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,200
I'll help Zhenzhu and Granny

592
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,400
with the sweet soup shop.

593
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,799
Let's get busy.

594
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,039
Things will be okay soon.

595
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,240
Okay.

596
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,480
I hope it didn't hit you.

597
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,000
Hai.

598
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,680
Girl.

599
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,680
Tell Rat and the others

600
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,160
to be cautious.

601
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,079
Otherwise,

602
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,200
I don't know what's in these bottles

603
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,039
next time.

604
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,039
Reading?

605
00:32:59,039 --> 00:32:59,759
What do you want?

606
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,240
Get out.

607
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,319
Reading?

608
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,119
What do you want?

609
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:03,799
Take it easy.

610
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,680
Calm down, guys.

611
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,559
What's

612
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,559
going on here?

613
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,880
Sorry, sir.

614
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,599
We're friends with the cashier girl.

615
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,279
We came to buy books.

616
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:13,880
What's wrong?

617
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,920
Not welcoming me?

618
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,200
I'm your friend?

619
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,599
I don't know you at all.

620
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,240
What?

621
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,599
We're your boyfriend's buddies!

622
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,279
Leave now, or I'll call the police.

623
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,759
Can't I buy books here?

624
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Is it against the law?

625
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,160
Come on.

626
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:34,480
Go ahead.

627
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:36,920
Tang! Tang!

628
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:40,960
Let go.

629
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,759
Let go.

630
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,000
Right.

631
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,559
Hey, here.

632
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:50,960
Buy some cigarettes.

633
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:51,920
Here.

634
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,000
Here.

635
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,679
Here.

636
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,760
Bro, here.

637
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,119
Buy your buddies cigarettes.

638
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:01,679
Sorry.

639
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,599
She is new here.

640
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,239
Come over.

641
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,079
Come over.

642
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,679
Look, he's

643
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,079
really good at it.

644
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,159
Call the police?

645
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,199
Let me tell you.

646
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,159
I've got plenty of time.

647
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,639
I can play with you every day.

648
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,400
Look, are these books

649
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,679
interesting?

650
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,519
Get something more exciting.

651
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,159
Okay? Tell me.

652
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:24,760
Yes.

653
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,800
Say it.

654
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,320
Yes.

655
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,119
I can't hear you!

656
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,119
Yes. Yes.

657
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,079
Good.

658
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,440
Call the police.

659
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:36,840
Buy books.

660
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,079
Fat Dog.

661
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,480
Let's go.

662
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,679
Like this one?

663
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,920
What are you staring at?

664
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,440
Want to get beaten?

665
00:34:59,239 --> 00:34:59,840
Sir.

666
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,239
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,039
Don't believe them.

668
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,440
I truly don't know them.

669
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,920
You shouldn't mess

670
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,840
with them.

671
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,119
I'm sorry.

672
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:21,760
Tang.

673
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,119
It's a small bookstore.

674
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,440
My wife and Hu live here.

675
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,320
I-I believe you.

676
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,522
But I can't mess with them.

677
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,519
They are barbarians.

678
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,719
Well, listen.

679
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,599
I-I'll

680
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,639
give you this month's salary early.

681
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,199
Take all of it.

682
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,079
You...

683
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,360
Should...

684
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:07,679
Should...

685
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,639
Focus on your studies.

686
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,880
I'm sorry.

687
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,480
Thank you, sir.

688
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,519
Thanks for taking care of me.

689
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,840
Sorry for causing you trouble.

690
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,039
I'm leaving.

691
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,960
Tang.

692
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,440
Why are you here?

693
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:31,840
Aren't you working?

694
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,079
I just came back.

695
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,920
What's up?

696
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,440
Xun, is something wrong
at the Billiards?

697
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,360
What do you mean?

698
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,320
Tang.

699
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,119
Did you hear some rumors?

700
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,280
Some punks caused trouble
at the bookstore today.

701
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,679
Punks?

702
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,239
Know their names?

703
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,920
I don't know.

704
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,920
Never seen them.

705
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,440
They came for you?

706
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,039
Said they'll keep coming

707
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,960
as long as I'm there.

708
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:21,960
I know who they are.

709
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,480
Xun.

710
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,840
Are you in some kind of trouble?

711
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,039
Tell me.

712
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,159
We don't want to work for Bao.

713
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:44,784
They want to take over the Billiards,

714
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,159
and Cha didn't agree.

715
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,840
I've been worried they'd cause trouble.

716
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,840
I was wondering with Rat

717
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,400
why they didn't make a move.

718
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,039
So they came to you.

719
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,239
Those scumbags!

720
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,599
Xun! Xun!

721
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,239
Xun, calm down!

722
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,039
Calm down.

723
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,599
They're trying to provoke you with this.

724
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,000
Don't fall for it.

725
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,719
I can't put you in trouble.

726
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,440
I won't.

727
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,400
They don't dare to come to school.

728
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,599
If they dare,

729
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,000
I'll call the police.

730
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,920
You finally get on the right track.

731
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,880
Don't ruin it because of me.

732
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,400
Promise me. Okay?

733
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,960
Promise me.

734
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:44,960
Please.

735
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,719
Don't worry.

736
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,039
I won't act rashly.

737
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,000
From now on,

738
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,320
I go wherever you go.

739
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,980
I'll protect you.

740
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:02,960
Okay.

741
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,384
(Temporarily Closed)

742
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:26,840
Cha.

743
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,559
You're finally back.

744
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:34,960
Why are you here?

745
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,440
When we came,

746
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,840
we saw this sign.

747
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,800
The door was locked.

748
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,320
I was so worried about you,

749
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,119
so we waited here.

750
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,800
If you are in trouble,

751
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,519
we couldn't explain to Bao.

752
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,280
You're Bao's favorite buddies.

753
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,239
Perfect.

754
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,719
Tell Bao this when you go back.

755
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,840
I'm closing the Billiards.

756
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,639
You think you can just quit?

757
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
What do you mean?

758
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,400
Nothing.

759
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,239
It's Bao's decision to make.

760
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,360
Let's take it easy

761
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,480
and not push us too hard.

762
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,239
Cha, I'm just delivering messages.

763
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,599
Since you said so,

764
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,079
I'll tell Bao about it.

765
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:16,920
Cha.

766
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:19,079
You know Miss Tan pretty well, right?

767
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,280
What do you want?

768
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,159
Nothing.

769
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,320
Come on.

770
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,079
I just want to ask

771
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,920
if Miss Tan is single.

772
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,280
Bao has been

773
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,960
worried no one

774
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,840
likes Fat Dog.

775
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,320
Miss Tan is great.

776
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,960
Young, in good shape,

777
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,400
gentle,

778
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,039
and kind...

779
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,280
If you target her,

780
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,239
I'll kill you.

781
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:48,159
It doesn't matter,

782
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,840
but there are so many of us here.

783
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,079
You only have two eyes.

784
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Can you monitor us all?

785
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,519
Good.

786
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,039
We're buddies, right?

787
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,840
Don't stay so hot-headed.

788
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:20,920
Give me a hug.

789
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,639
Much better.

790
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,159
Go back.

791
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,400
We're going back.

792
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:33,920
Don't stay up late.

793
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:35,639
Let's go.

794
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,039
Exhausted.

795
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,039
What?

796
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,800
They went to the bookstore?

797
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,639
Right.

798
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:54,400
Ye Haitang can't
even work part-time now.

799
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,039
Do you think

800
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,440
they'll go to Zhenzhu

801
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,239
or Granny?

802
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,159
Cha,

803
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
if this continues,

804
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,519
Zhenzhu and Tang will both be in danger.

805
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,639
You think Tan Xin is safe?

806
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,159
They went to Miss Tan?

807
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:16,519
Those scumbags!

808
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,400
Cha.

809
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,440
We can't just sit here.

810
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,239
We have to do something.

811
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,159
Say something!

812
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,480
Can you be quiet?

813
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:24,960
I'll handle it.

814
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,400
Let me think.

815
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,239
Okay?

816
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:31,039
It's okay.

817
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,360
Don't worry. I come frequently.

818
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,519
I'll keep a close eye on it.

819
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,000
Good.

820
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,280
This can be sold for money.

821
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,039
What are you doing?

822
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,119
Who are you?

823
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,039
Who are you then?

824
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,000
Security.

825
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:50,119
Well,

826
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,199
we're scheduled

827
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:53,159
for demolition here next week.

828
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,280
We need to clear it out now.

829
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,480
No one informed you?

830
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,000
Quan. Quan.

831
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,039
Can you hear me?

832
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,559
Go find Sun Miaomiao now.

833
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:03,559
She has connections.

834
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,039
Anyway,

835
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,320
keep the mailbox for me, okay?

836
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:08,960
Any papers?

837
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,559
Our superiors didn't give us.

838
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,000
We require official papers.

839
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,360
It's the regulation.

840
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:30,504
(Yuetu 205)

841
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,400
Coming.

842
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:40,000
Who are you?

843
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,840
You're Tang Yixun's daughter?

844
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,280
Yes.

845
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,599
And you are?

846
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,840
Rat.

847
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:55,559
