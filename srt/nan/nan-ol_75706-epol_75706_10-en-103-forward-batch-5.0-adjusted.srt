[Episode 10]

3
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,560
What's the situation now?

4
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,120
The Yao Army

5
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,710
has advanced more than 20 li forward.

6
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,150
They're expected to reach our borders
by dusk tonight.

7
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,870
Pass down the order:

8
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,680
count the weapons,

9
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,740
prepare the troops,

10
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,000
and all officers ranked
Lieutenant and above

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,890
should report to
the main tent for instructions.

12
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,820
Yes, Commander.

13
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,710
Go back to the city immediately

14
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,910
and check if Jin'an is at home

15
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,260
and whether he's injured.

16
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,190
Yes, Commander.

17
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,280
I made your favorite pear blossom pastries

18
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,430
and wanted to bring them here
while they're still warm.

19
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,310
But it seems

20
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,810
this isn't a good time.

21
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,410
Military matters are urgent.

22
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,540
You'll have to wait.

23
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,090
The Yao Army has been resentful ever since

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,720
their defeated last time because
of our fake defense map.

25
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,980
This time they'll surely come prepared.

26
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,829
With Shi Du, someone I have
defeated before, leading the troops,

27
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,230
there's nothing to fear.

28
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,260
But according to reports,

29
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,220
the Yao Army

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,190
has deployed 50,000 troops,

31
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,630
far exceeding our military strength.

32
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,430
I'm afraid we

33
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,090
need to respond with caution.

34
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,810
Indeed,

35
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,280
I've heard

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,420
Shi Du has a strategist named
Liu Yun by his side.

37
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,100
This man is full of tricks,

38
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,310
we must be extremely careful.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,520
You are indeed wise.

40
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,910
However,

41
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,630
in this battle we must use our wits.

42
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,790
In military strategy,

43
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,800
the supreme tactic is to
attack the enemy's mind.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
Fighting against superior numbers,

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
creating an illusion of
strength is crucial.

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,000
Our forces

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
are less than 20,000,

48
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,280
but we'll claim to have 40,000.

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,470
This way,

50
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,680
when the battle begins

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,400
and they only see half
our claimed numbers,

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,310
they will surely think we're
holding troops in reserve,

53
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,440
making them hesitant to commit fully.

54
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,430
Furthermore,

55
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,740
the Yao Army is penetrating deep
into our territory

56
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,960
without thorough knowledge of the terrain.

57
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,280
The northwestern plains

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,750
are the best place to break through,

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,630
but they only know it's flat land,

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,360
unaware of the trenches there.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,120
When the time comes,

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,960
we'll feign defeat and retreat,

63
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,339
luring them into the narrow passage.

64
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,360
By the time they realize
they've fallen into our trap,

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,430
they'll already be trapped
in the narrow terrain.

66
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,560
As long as we

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,680
position archers in the
high ground beforehand,

68
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,560
we can wipe them out completely.

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,950
Wait.

70
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,040
Her plan is clever,

71
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,090
but it still has flaws.

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,850
With this strategy,

73
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,480
victory is within our grasp.

74
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,210
What brilliant plan, General.

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,909
Stop there!

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,870
I wonder how many arrows
we have in our arsenal.

77
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,480
Are they enough

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,680
to kill all the Yao soldiers on the spot?

79
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,870
If we can't stop them,

80
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,000
they'll keep coming in waves,

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,390
walking over dead bodies
of their own.

82
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,310
This pass

83
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,380
would be impossible to defend.

84
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,040
What kind of beasts

85
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,160
would trample over their
own brothers' bodies

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,310
to charge forward?

87
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,430
Let him in.

88
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,950
The enemy

89
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,630
has already arranged
civilians as suicide troops.

90
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,120
So, after the vanguard withstands
our ambush,

91
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,180
reinforcements will surely follow.

92
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,870
Since this is the situation,

93
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,130
we must see it through.

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,310
We must burn

95
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,310
that passage

96
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,200
to completely block the enemy forces.

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,420
Shoot!

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,159
Also,

99
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,400
those civilians at the front,

100
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,690
if they don't resist stubbornly,

101
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,020
there's no need to slaughter them all.

102
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,080
The Changfeng Army aims for victory,

103
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,490
not massacre.

104
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,270
The Changfeng Army

105
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,750
has won a great victory!

106
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,750
Changfeng Army will triumph!

107
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,770
Changfeng Army will triumph!

108
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
Changfeng Army will triumph!

109
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,280
We've won! Victory!

110
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,920
Our first battle was successful,

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,480
and Yao's remaining forces have
retreated to their camp.

112
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,160
This time,

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,360
the enemy's morale has been
severely damaged.

114
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,070
If we fight again,

115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,120
we'll surely have the advantage.

116
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,240
This tough battle

117
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,490
has only just begun.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,950
Send orders

119
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,090
for all troops to take shifts and prepare,

120
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,680
remain vigilant at all times,

121
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,410
and never let down their guard.

122
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,560
Yes.

123
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,760
Where is Jin'an?

124
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,870
Outsiders are strictly forbidden to
move freely in the camp.

125
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,600
I've arranged for him to
stay in the barracks

126
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
under special guard.

127
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,630
Go bring him here.

128
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,170
General,

129
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,180
this man's identity is unknown.

130
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,250
He has repeatedly put you in danger,

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,500
and now he's offering military advice

132
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,620
with such insight,

133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
which makes him highly suspicious.

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Therefore, I believe

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
keeping him close to you

136
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
is truly inappropriate.

137
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,480
Recently,

138
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,310
though there have been many troubles,

139
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,110
since he entered our household,

140
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,550
he hasn't shown any signs of betrayal.

141
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,410
But General,

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,490
his strategy today

143
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,490
shows how wise and insightful he is.

144
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,460
If he's deliberately lying low,

145
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,270
it could lead to endless trouble later.

146
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,630
Just follow my orders.

147
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,930
As for the rest,

148
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,920
I know what I'm doing.

149
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,270
Yes.

150
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,360
Sir.

151
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,030
Sir!

152
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,570
You nearly scared me to death!

153
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,080
Is the carriage ready?

154
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,720
Sir,

155
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:49,510
great news!

156
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,750
The Yao Army

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,820
has retreated!

158
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,970
Is this true?

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
Absolutely true.

160
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
The frontline has just

161
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,630
sent news of a great victory.

162
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,360
I

163
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,440
wouldn't dare to lie.

164
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,150
I never thought that lady

165
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,720
actually had some skill.

166
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,000
They're just a bunch of infantry soldiers

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,360
copying from military manuals.

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,720
If not for your lordship commanding

169
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
this battle from the rear,

170
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,910
planning strategies and
stabilizing morale,

171
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,150
Lucheng would

172
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,910
have fallen long ago.

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This woman is playing dirty tricks!

174
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,000
I warned against
underestimating the enemy.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,480
Now our army has suffered heavy losses.

176
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,990
[Counsellor of Yao, Liu Yun]

177
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,120
General Shi, what's your plan?

178
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
It's all my fault,

179
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,200
for not

180
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,400
heeding your words before.

181
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,440
I plan

182
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,390
to let our troops rest and recover,

183
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,630
wait until morale is restored,

184
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,160
then attack Lucheng again.

185
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,920
What does you think?

186
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,120
So we're just going back like this?

187
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,780
Since we've started this war,

188
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,050
we must see it through,

189
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,440
just not right now.

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,030
Send word

191
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,320
to our people inside Lucheng to
take action.

192
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,850
Yes, sir.

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,790
General.

194
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,870
Know yourself and your enemy,
coordinate inside and outside forces,

195
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,470
and victory will be certain.

196
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,840
Now that

197
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,810
the threat to Lucheng has been resolved,

198
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,390
I must celebrate.

199
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,320
All my recent

200
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,720
exhaustive efforts weren't in vain.

201
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,720
I've heard there's a brothel in Lucheng

202
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,000
with a unique style.

203
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Would you

204
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
be interested

205
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,370
in experiencing it yourself, sir?

206
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,490
What quality could a
frontier town possibly offer?

207
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,100
However...

208
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,170
it wouldn't hurt to take a look.

209
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,670
Just to

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,270
experience the local customs.

211
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,200
General.

212
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
You deserve great merit

213
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
for today's victory.

214
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,180
Isn't there anything you want to ask?

215
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,630
We've been through so much together,

216
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,360
I understand your intentions.

217
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
If something's really wrong,

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,660
I don't need to ask.

219
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,150
You'll tell me yourself.

220
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,630
Actually, those strategic plans

221
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,120
seemed like they were already in my mind.

222
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,270
Somehow,

223
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,230
they just came out on their own.

224
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,960
I don't understand why either.

225
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,550
Perhaps

226
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,510
you're just learning things by

227
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,670
living here.

228
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,030
Maybe.

229
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,510
The military camp is no place to linger.

230
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,360
I've instructed Ji Ran

231
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,760
to escort you back first.

232
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,510
All right,

233
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,240
I'll wait for you at home.

234
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,030
Wait.

235
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,240
Though the Yao Army has retreated,

236
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,630
it's still chaotic outside.

237
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,270
Those clothes from the general's mansion

238
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,960
are bound to attract attention.

239
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
Change before you leave.

240
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Change here?

241
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,030
Yes, here.

242
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
No wounds.

243
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,320
How is this possible?

244
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,150
Was I mistaken?

245
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,630
What's wrong?

246
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,240
Nothing.

247
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,340
You should hurry back.

248
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,870
What's the matter?

249
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,870
Are you all right?

250
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,840
I'll go get a physician.

251
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,630
It's fine.

252
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,960
It happens all the time.

253
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,870
I just need some sleep and I'll be fine.

254
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,030
All the time?

255
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,750
When did it start?

256
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,480
Probably...

257
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,390
since the Battle of Lucheng.

258
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,960
So it started after I came to you.

259
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,610
Actually, I don't think so.

260
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,390
Come to think of it,

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,240
it started long ago.

262
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,050
With the recent border conflicts,

263
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,720
even the healthiest body
would be exhausted.

264
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
It has nothing to do with you.

265
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,080
Then promise me,

266
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,430
once the fighting eases,

267
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,270
you'll let Lu Xin

268
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,530
examine you properly.

269
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,360
Sure.

270
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,270
Mr. Ji.

271
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
When will

272
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,200
this war be over?

273
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm not trying to spy on military matters.

274
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,440
I just want to know

275
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,580
when the General can return home.

276
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,200
Why do you care

277
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,210
when the General returns?

278
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,870
Mr. Ji,

279
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,590
why have you stopped?

280
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
Who are you really?

281
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,600
What do you mean, Mr. Ji?

282
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,010
Don't you recognize me outside the camp?

283
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,490
Since you appeared,

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,200
the General has faced danger
multiple times.

285
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,240
She's always been cautious,

286
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
yet you show up with an unknown background

287
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,030
and find every way to stay by her side.

288
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,010
I'll ask you once more:

289
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,250
who are you really?

290
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,460
I was in trouble when I came here

291
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,840
and was fortunate the General saved me.

292
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,100
That's the only reason

293
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,940
I'm alive and by her side.

294
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,670
I only wish to repay her kindness.

295
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,800
What about the flame mark on your neck?

296
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,500
Before you appeared,

297
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,910
there was a child in the army
named Jin'an too.

298
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,630
You showed up

299
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,760
and he disappeared.

300
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,330
You both have the
same flame mark on your necks.

301
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,930
Could you be the same person?

302
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,600
Mr. Ji,

303
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,360
there are many things
I don't understand either.

304
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
I can't remember either.

305
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,870
No matter how much you pressure me,

306
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,730
I can't tell you what I don't know–

307
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,440
Speak.

308
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,440
It seems

309
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,370
he won't let this go easily.

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,390
But my strength is depleted,

311
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,390
and I have no power to fight back now.

312
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,070
Mr. Ji, are you planning to

313
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,400
act first and report later?

314
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,790
If you deal with me without authorization,

315
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,750
aren't you afraid the General will
hold you accountable?

316
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,480
My life belongs to the General.

317
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,670
For her safety,

318
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,860
I'm willing to take all the blame.

319
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,240
He's dead?

320
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,930
It happened so suddenly.

321
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,620
I couldn't save him in time.

322
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,050
Who gave you permission to
act on your own?

323
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,410
I have failed in my duty

324
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,810
and deserve to die for it.

325
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,070
But General,

326
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,750
this man refused to talk
even as he was dying,

327
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,070
he must be hiding something.

328
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,750
Please think–

329
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,550
Enough!

330
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,590
He just helped us defeat the enemy,

331
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,790
and based on your mere suspicion,

332
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,850
you decided whether he lives or dies?

333
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,380
You've violated military law

334
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,770
by acting without orders.

335
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,140
When we return to the city,

336
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,850
you'll be thrown in prison immediately.

337
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,510
Right now,

338
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,410
take a team and search for him.

339
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,040
Bring him back alive if possible,

340
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,200
or at least recover his body.

341
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,920
I...

342
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,110
understand my orders.

343
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,140
I still have so many questions for
you to answer,

344
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,190
so you're not allowed to die.

345
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,520
You must come back alive.

346
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,960
Sir.

347
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,000
Beautiful lady,

348
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,270
drink up.

349
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,030
Sir,

350
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,750
I really can't drink anymore.

351
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,880
Drink.

352
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,000
I truly cannot drink anymore.

353
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,240
Can't drink?

354
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,980
I'll feed you myself.

355
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,680
Open your mouth.

356
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,920
Be good.

357
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,150
You wretch!

358
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,200
How dare you ruin my good time!

359
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
I can't handle alcohol well,

360
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,830
I don't mean to offend you.

361
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,440
Please forgive me, sir.

362
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,960
Tears on your pretty face,

363
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,440
how can I

364
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,090
not teach you a proper lesson?

365
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,270
Wine.

366
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,640
Sir,

367
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,920
punishing this girl is a small matter,

368
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,070
but if you harm yourself with anger,

369
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,510
my heart

370
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,270
would break.

371
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,070
You're the sweetest.

372
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,880
Since you're

373
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,360
so considerate,

374
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,880
tonight I will

375
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,840
certainly give you some special attention.

376
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,920
You little slut!

377
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,640
How dare you compete
with me for his favor!

378
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,600
Sir, please wait a moment,

379
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,030
don't let her ruin our fun.

380
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,970
I'll report this to the madam

381
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,900
and have you beaten black and blue!

382
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,070
Go quickly.

383
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,470
I can't let you suffer in my place,

384
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,960
he'll torture you to death.

385
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,560
Don't worry,

386
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I can handle it.

387
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,770
It seems

388
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,090
that strange power has
saved my life again.

389
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,480
That's so unexpected of Ji Ran.

390
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
He's usually so quiet and reserved,

391
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,720
yet he's so

392
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,580
ruthless and decisive in action.

393
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,690
I should return to
the general's mansion first.

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,960
Sir.

395
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,440
Sir.

396
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:43,300
[Granary]

397
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,280
Who's there?

398
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,350
There's an emergency at the front line.

399
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,590
I've been sent by the Military Supervisor

400
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,240
to inspect the granary reserves.

401
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,040
Open the door.

402
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,350
Opening the granary is a serious matter,

403
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,110
always requiring the general's orders.

404
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,960
We haven't

405
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,000
received any prior notification.

406
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,830
Lord Li is specially appointed by
the imperial court

407
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,880
with the emperor's decree to
supervise military affairs.

408
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,720
Even the general must follow his orders.

409
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,200
If you don't recognize this token,

410
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400
do you expect him

411
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,440
to come all the way here himself?

412
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,180
-We dare not.
-We dare not.

413
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,510
Beautiful lady.

414
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,350
Bring me some water.

415
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,810
Put out the fire, quick!

416
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:50,920
Quick!

417
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,160
Hurry!

418
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,750
Water!

419
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,310
Water!

420
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,830
Signal flare!

421
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,680
Catch her!

422
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,430
Quick!

423
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,310
Take this

424
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,110
and report to the military camp.

425
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,550
Go!

426
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,110
Yes!

427
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,070
General.

428
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,520
It's coming from
the direction of the granary.

429
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,210
General!

430
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,920
The city reported that

431
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,200
a woman with Li Zhangyi's token

432
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,000
claimed she needed to inspect the granary,

433
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,350
but instead set fire to it,

434
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,110
causing severe damage.

435
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,360
What's her background?

436
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,920
No idea.

437
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,830
She's already escaped.

438
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,350
This was

439
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,350
left at the scene.

440
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,680
This is from Yao State.

441
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,640
The granary is a highly secured location

442
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,400
with multiple layers of defense,

443
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,130
yet she moved freely in and out.

444
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
She must

445
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,000
be a spy planted by Yao State.

446
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,920
It seems Li Zhangyi fell into their trap.

447
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,280
This signal flare is intact.

448
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,880
The news probably

449
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,280
hasn't been sent out yet.

450
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,400
How much longer does
our army need to recover?

451
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,680
We can move out at dawn.

452
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,310
Though we won this battle,

453
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,910
the enemy has 50,000 troops,

454
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,110
greatly outnumbering us.

455
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,650
Now that our supplies have been burned,

456
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,310
we shouldn't stay any longer.

457
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,500
Send the order:

458
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,120
we break camp after dawn!

459
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,280
Yes, General.

460
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Luo Teng.

461
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,310
Take this back to the general's residence

462
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,040
and tell them

463
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
that before dawn,

464
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,810
they must capture that woman.

465
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,350
Yes.

466
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,440
Sir.

467
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,240
I've cleared out everyone

468
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,310
from the entertainment house.

469
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,110
But Yunge...

470
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,000
What about her?

471
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,400
She wasn't among them.

472
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,830
You!

473
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,330
I deserve to die!

474
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,960
Useless fool.

475
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,550
Li Shuang is about to return to the city.

476
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,830
If Yunge falls into Li Shuang's hands,

477
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,680
and she learns about the lost token

478
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,400
and how all the burned supplies

479
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,240
are due to my negligence,

480
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,550
do you know what the consequences will be?

481
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,830
Sir, please don't worry,

482
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,640
you are the military supervisor

483
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,920
personally appointed by the Emperor.

484
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,880
Surely they wouldn't dare.

485
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,510
You know nothing!

486
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,430
If Yunge is truly a Yao spy,

487
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,830
they could easily accuse me

488
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,240
of treason.

489
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,160
Dying hundred times over

490
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,900
wouldn't be enough a punishment for me!

491
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,030
It's all your fault!

492
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,370
For persuading me to go to that brothel,

493
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,040
causing so much trouble.

494
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,400
Let me tell you,

495
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,790
if I'm implicated,

496
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,070
you won't live either.

497
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,270
Sir, please be wise!

498
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,960
I truly didn't know!

499
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,400
Please have mercy, sir.

500
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,580
Considering how loyally

501
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,790
I've served you,

502
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,000
spare my life.

503
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,680
Enough!

504
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,640
At this point,

505
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,510
there's only one way out.

506
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,350
We absolutely cannot let

507
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,150
Li Shuang meet Yunge alive.

508
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,270
Sir, you mean...

509
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,770
But Li Shuang is with the Changfeng Army,

510
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,660
it's difficult to make a move.

511
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,640
As a general, Li Shuang

512
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,350
cannot die mysteriously.

513
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,080
But what if she dies by
a Yao soldier's blade?

514
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,430
That'd be killing two birds with
one stone.

515
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,110
How brilliant, sir.

516
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,040
Using someone else's knife to kill,

517
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,900
eliminating Prince Li's concern

518
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,660
while keeping yourself safe.

519
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,990
Continue searching.

520
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,270
Even if you have to turn Lucheng upside down,

521
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,200
you must find Yunge,

522
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,470
dead or alive.

523
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,510
Also,

524
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,680
immediately send men

525
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,880
to replace all the city guards

526
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,240
with our own people.

527
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,530
Seal the city gates.

528
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,350
Until this matter is resolved,

529
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,310
Li Shuang must not enter the city!

530
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,640
Yes.

531
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,920
Urgent military report!

532
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,950
Urgent military report!

533
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,360
[General's Residence]

534
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,480
What is it?

535
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,930
Someone set fire to the granary.

536
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,720
The general orders

537
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,680
the arsonist be captured tonight.

538
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,590
Who did it?

539
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,700
It's only known it was a woman,

540
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,960
likely a Yao State spy.

541
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,880
This is our only lead.

542
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,400
Since she's been exposed,

543
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,000
trying to leave the city openly

544
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
won't be easy.

545
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,070
She must be disguised

546
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,030
and hiding somewhere in the city,

547
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,360
waiting for her chance.

548
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,550
Quickly tell Cuiyun

549
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,720
to make the arrangements.

550
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,830
Everyone from the mansion should
team up in pairs

551
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,030
and search throughout the city,

552
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,240
especially in
remote areas and poor alleys.

553
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,440
Don't let her escape.

554
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,960
Got it.

555
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,030
This scent...

556
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,720
it's the unique fragrance from
Fragrance Garden.

557
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,160
The intruder moved so efficiently,

558
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,820
they must have come prepared.

559
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,880
If we don't find this person quickly,

560
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,010
once Yao State gets the news,

561
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,650
they'll surely strike again,

562
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,650
and then Li Shuang will be in danger.

563
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,650
I'm still one step too late.

564
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,410
Miss?

565
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,120
Miss?

566
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,450
What happened?

567
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,370
Who did this?

568
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,960
Li Zhangyi...

569
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,120
He claimed Yunge is a Yao State spy

570
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,670
and forced the madam to hand her over.

571
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,390
Yunge...

572
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,050
Is she the one with a sachet

573
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,650
embroidered with the characters "Yanzhi"?

574
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,920
That was my gift to her.

575
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Yanzhi is my name.

576
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,160
Yunge would never do that.

577
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
She's been wrongly accused.

578
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,730
Say no more,

579
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,830
let me take you to a doctor.

580
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,480
No.

581
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,590
City...

582
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,300
City God Temple.

583
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,540
City God Temple...

584
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,580
Ms. Yanzhi...

585
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,200
Ms. Yanzhi!

586
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,290
Have you seen this person?

587
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,270
Have you seen this person?

588
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,200
Never seen them.

589
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,650
Have you seen this person?

590
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,780
I haven't seen them.

591
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,050
Have you seen this person?

592
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:24,880
Report!

593
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,550
Mission accomplished.

594
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,080
The granaries in
Taijin have been destroyed.

595
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,930
General.

596
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
With the granaries destroyed,

597
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,000
Li Shuang will surely withdraw
her troops back to the city.

598
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,440
When the gates of Lucheng open wide,

599
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,590
our army can seize this opportunity

600
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,440
to charge straight in

601
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,570
and launch a surprise counterattack.

602
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,400
Soldiers!

603
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,550
Follow me to battle!

604
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,110
The General has returned!

605
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,030
Open the gates!

606
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,090
Without Lord Li's orders,

607
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,660
I cannot open the gates.

608
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,270
They're not our men.

609
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,990
Li Zhangyi deliberately arranged this.

610
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,790
The Northern Commander is here!

611
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,530
Who does Li Zhangyi think he is?

612
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,270
Tell him to get down here and
explain himself!

613
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,070
How dare you!

614
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,540
Lord Li is here by imperial decree.

615
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,550
You're just a minor officer,

616
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,450
how dare you be so disrespectful!

617
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,280
Luo Teng.

618
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,160
Officer Luo meant no disrespect.

619
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,070
I

620
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,160
will discipline him accordingly.

621
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,070
Please, Lord Li,
give the order immediately

622
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,680
to let our troops enter the city.

623
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,590
The city's

624
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,290
granaries caught on fire.

625
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,240
I've ordered men to capture the suspect.

626
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
To prevent

627
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,240
the criminal from escaping
during the chaos,

628
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,550
I hope the General

629
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,820
can wait a moment.

630
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,030
The situation is urgent

631
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,160
and brooks no delay.

632
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,790
The Yao Army

633
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,390
has mobilized 50,000 troops

634
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,310
and has spies hiding in our Lucheng,

635
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,710
plotting for a long time.

636
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,240
Sir, why are you delaying

637
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,200
at such a critical moment?

638
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,920
Li Shuang.

639
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,680
As a general,

640
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,750
I never expected you to be such a coward.

641
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,880
The battle has barely begun,

642
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,200
yet you're already thinking of retreat.

643
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,750
His Majesty ordered me

644
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,160
to supervise this military campaign.

645
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,030
I will fulfill my duty faithfully.

646
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,480
This battle

647
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,510
must be fought.

648
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,440
Delicious.

649
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,660
How is it?

650
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,810
Good wine, isn't it?

651
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,440
Yunge.

652
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,310
She's got something.

653
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,920
But not much.

654
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,030
So you're Yunge?

655
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,989
Take her away.

656
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,320
Your timing is impeccable.

657
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,120
A moment later

658
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,080
and I would have caught her myself.

659
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,870
Aren't...

660
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,360
Aren't you dead?

661
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,590
Do you only wish the worst for me?

662
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,030
I'm trying to catch someone here.

663
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,440
Jin'an.

664
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,190
It's alright, Sister Qiao'er,

665
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,920
don't worry.

666
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,360
The message has been sent out.

667
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,290
There's no time.

668
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,489
Come with me.

669
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,440
Who do you think you are?

670
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,000
Come with me.

671
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,480
Yes.

672
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,440
Yes.

673
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,030
Our soldiers have fought hard until now

674
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,699
and are completely exhausted.

675
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,900
Sending us now

676
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,320
would be sending us to our deaths.

677
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,400
A mere lieutenant

678
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,960
dares to undermine morale like this.

679
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,480
You!

680
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,150
Do you know I have the Emperor's authority

681
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,440
and can execute you
without prior approval?

682
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,280
Report!

683
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,700
Sir.

684
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,480
Someone downstairs requests an audience,

685
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,670
claiming to be from the General's mansion.

686
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,360
Refuse it.

687
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,590
He brought a brocade box

688
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,320
and insists you must accept it.

689
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,950
Sir.

690
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,450
Where is he?

691
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,610
Below the city wall.

692
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,480
Bring him up.

693
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,190
Yes, sir.

694
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,690
You again.

695
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,670
I humbly beg Lord Li

696
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,110
to open the city gates

697
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,970
and let the Changfeng Army enter.

698
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,920
The Changfeng Army

699
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,550
is the last line of defense
against the Yao State.

700
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,750
If they are defeated,

701
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,420
Lucheng will certainly be at
the enemy's mercy.

702
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,350
Can you afford to

703
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,770
let that happen?

704
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
How dare you.

705
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,780
Are you threatening me?

706
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,250
I wouldn't dare.

707
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,110
By the way,

708
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,590
I've sent Yunge

709
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,200
safely to the general's mansion.

710
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,230
I assume you agreed to meet me

711
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,360
because you recognized

712
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,710
that sachet.

713
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,800
If you open the city gates

714
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,410
and let the Changfeng Army in,

715
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,210
I'll return Yunge to you.

716
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,360
It's never too late

717
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,070
to mend the fold,
even after the sheep are lost.

718
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,550
Sir,

719
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,480
at this point ,

720
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,250
we might as well go all the way.

721
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,840
Since he's talking like this,

722
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,920
he's clearly trying to claim

723
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,440
that you're connected to Yunge.

724
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,100
You mustn't fall for his trap!

725
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,800
Report!

726
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,630
The Yao Army has launched
a surprise attack

727
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,030
and is only 10 miles away.

728
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,810
Trying to negotiate with me?

729
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,290
Who do you think you are?

730
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,840
The Yao Army will be at
our gates any moment.

731
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,590
As long as Li Shuang dies,

732
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,630
I can still rest easy.

733
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,000
You dare threaten an imperial official!

734
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,550
Jin'an!

735
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,730
If anything happens to Official Li,

736
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,450
do you think you can escape?

737
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,010
My life means nothing,

738
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,800
but Official Li,

739
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,650
your life is so precious.

740
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,990
To have a companion like you

741
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,220
on my journey to the underworld...

742
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,650
would be my greatest honor.

743
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,950
Report!

744
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,510
The Yao Army is

745
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,570
only three miles from the city gates.

746
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,980
Open the gates!

747
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,210
Open up!

748
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,290
I said open the gates! Are you deaf?

749
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,890
Wait!

750
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,920
General!

751
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,850
The Yao Army is at our gates.

752
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,110
Opening the gates now

753
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,340
would be like letting wolves
into our home.

754
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,200
The civilians would be in danger.

755
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,880
Our only option

756
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,110
is to lure the Yao Army

757
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,480
to the dense forest outside the city,

758
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,010
then we might have a chance.

759
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,360
All troops, attention!

760
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,440
Follow me to fight the enemy,

761
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,070
and swear to share the fate

762
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,550
of Lucheng!

763
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,470
Share its fate!

764
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:36,420
Charge!

765
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,570
All of you, go over there!

766
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,800
Hurry up!

767
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,280
Sir!

768
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,640
Catch him!

769
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,120
Quick!

770
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,660
Yes!

771
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,720
Sir!

772
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,960
Kill them all,

773
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,230
leave no one alive!

774
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,400
General!

775
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,870

00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,320
Who else wants to join him?

807
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,620
General Shi Du has fallen in battle!

808
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,920
Run!

809
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,000
Run for your lives!

810
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,030
Retreat!

811
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,280
You've saved me multiple times.

812
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,570
You are a benefactor to
me and the Changfeng Army.

813
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,910
But why do you always
refuse to show your true face?

814
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,120
Who I am is not important.

815
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,680
But whatever you want to do,

816
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,470
I'll do my best to make it happen.

817
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,250
Whatever you wish to do,

818
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,130
I'll try my hardest to accomplish it.

819
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,860
Our blood oath may be real,

820
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,760
but my desire to protect you

821
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,110
is also real.

822
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,920
General,

823
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,810
the city gates are open.

824
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,820
This hero has impressive skills.

825
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,320
Who exactly is he?
