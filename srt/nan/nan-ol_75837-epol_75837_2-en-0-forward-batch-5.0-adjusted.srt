(We're all people
who crawled out of the muddy pit.)

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,440
(No one understands better than us)

4
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,879
(how pathetically small
and insignificant)

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,039
(our lives are.)

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,160
(The pit isn't the worst part.)

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,439
(I wanted to free you
from this endless suffering.)

8
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,719
(But instead,)

9
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,079
(I opened another abyss.)

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,000
(The abyss is worse than the pit.)

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,240
(Because demons)

12
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,960
(lurk in the abyss.)

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,040
(What can we possibly do?)

14
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,280
(So many things aren't ours to choose,)

15
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,120
(nor can we ever change them.)

16
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,200
(I truly wanted to save you)

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,719
(from this endless torment.)

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,760
(But I myself...)

19
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,959

(Love Letter)

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,919
Where are you running to?

23
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,960
Get back here!

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,199
Explain before leaving!

25
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,039
You need to tell me!

26
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,439
How far did you go?

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Did you kiss him or not?

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
I didn't.

29
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,159
Just like your shameless mother!

30
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,159
Already chasing after men at your age?

31
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,639
Both of you have no dignity.

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,159
But I still want my pride, understand?

33
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,960
I didn't!

34
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,120
Don't lie!

35
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,000
Enough. Give me money.

36
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,479
I don't have any.

37
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,240
Your part-time job money!

38
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,639
Did you give it to him?

39
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,520
Your job money!

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,599
Give me!

41
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,759
Why's it so little?

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,000
This is all the money I have.

43
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,319
Take it,

44
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,599
and I won't even eat tomorrow!

45
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,520
Without it,

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
I can't see tomorrow!

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,159
You've got more.

48
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
There's none.

49
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,000
You do.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,639
No!

51
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,520
Show me.

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,120
No!

53
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,479
Give me!

54
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:51,879
No!

55
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,599
Look at all this cash!

56
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,719
This isn't mine!

57
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,360
It's class funds. You can't take it!

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,800
Tang! Tang!

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,120
Dad!

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,599
I'm begging you, please!

61
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,479
Tomorrow,

62
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,199
if I win,

63
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,240
I'll pay it all back!

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
This isn't mine!

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,120
After I win tomorrow!

66
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,520
Give it back! Give it back!

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,000
Dad!

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,000
Ye Yibo.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
If you don't give me the money today,

70
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,600
you're not leaving this house!

71
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,240
Go ahead! Hit me!

72
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,720
Do it!

73
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:39,800
Strike me!

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,959
I gave you this life.

75
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,240
How dare you hit me?

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,879
Take it back then.

77
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I stopped wanting it long ago.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,199
Tang, get up.

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Tang.

80
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,680
Your life means nothing.

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,199
Neither does mine.

82
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,000
But if you stay alive, it means a lot.

83
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,040
You still want to attend university?

84
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,680
You think a university accepts anyone?

85
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,519
Stop daydreaming!

86
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,079
Now,

87
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,040
just marry someone rich.

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,560
Then I can

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,160
live a good life with you.

90
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,199
You carry my blood.

91
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,040
I'll always be your father.

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,040
I'll always follow you.

93
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,279
Even in death, I'll haunt you.

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,079
Calm down.

95
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
When I strike it rich,

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,959
I'll buy you midnight snacks.

97
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,720
Midnight snacks.

98
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,040
Look at this mess.

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
Y-Y-You clean this up.

100
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,800
Clean it.

101
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,240
But I still want to try.

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
Try one more time.

103
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,519
Pull you out of the abyss.

104
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,360
What's all this?

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
It's a total mess.

106
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,879
Someone's definitely targeting you.

107
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,600
Did you offend someone at school?

108
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,000
I've only been
at this school for two days.

109
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,519
Except for Ye Yibo's daughter,

110
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,879
I haven't met anyone else before.

111
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,000
Then it must be her.

112
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,399
It's definitely her.

113
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,360
Didn't you say

114
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,240
she cornered you at the school gate

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
for the money on the first day?

116
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
I don't think so.

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,959
But her attitude

118
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,639
toward me at school
is genuinely strange.

119
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,120
And she never told Xin
about me collecting

120
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,399
debts from her family.

121
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
Something's fishy here.

122
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,399
Your rivalry path

123
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,000
is way too narrow.

124
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,000
And now you're in the same class.

125
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,639
What I'm scared of is

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,079
that if Xin knows about

127
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,519
me collecting debts from her house.

128
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,480
If all else fails,
I'll return the money to her.

129
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,120
No.

130
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,759
Xun.

131
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,160
You didn't leave that money.

132
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,879
That hundred yuan.

133
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,639
Are you crazy?

134
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:47,800
Well.

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,959
Tomorrow, I'll bring some men

136
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,120
to corner her at the school.

137
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,279
See if she'll make trouble.

138
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,399
Enough, Rat.

139
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm spending money to buy peace.

140
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,519
Don't stir up trouble.

141
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,240
We can't let this escalate.

142
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,399
If Xin finds out Cha takes us

143
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,720
to collect debts daily,

144
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,160
she'll yell at him.

145
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,000
You've seen how Xin gets.

146
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,759
Enough.

147
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,199
I'm leaving.

148
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,959
Close this window for me.

149
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,960
(Grandma,)

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
(I'm going to join you.)

151
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,000
(I'm sorry.)

152
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,279
(I really can't hold on any longer.)

153
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,279
(I've tried so hard,)

154
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,919
(exhausting every possible method.)

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,600
(But it's too hopeless.)

156
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,320
(But I can never escape Meiwan Town)

157
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
(or get away from him.)

158
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
(I'm so tired.)

159
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,720
(I only got this last bit
of strength left.)

160
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,159
(So I chose this path.)

161
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,720
(I have no regrets.)

162
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,200
(My only regret
is not seeing Mom again.)

163
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,720
(Mom,)

164
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,759
(if you read this letter,
please forgive me.)

165
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,480
(Forgive my weakness.)

166
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,879
(Forgive me for not finding you yet.)

167
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,000
(Right now, I don't even know
whom to say goodbye to.)

168
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,159
(Then let it be my 19-year-old self.)

169
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,480
(If my life could start over,)

170
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,912
(To Ye Haitang, 1991.9.3)
(I hope I get a chance to choose.)

171
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:16,919
(Goodbye.)

172
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,559
- Big
- Big.

173
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,200
Why are you holding a knife?

174
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,600
Open it.

175
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,159
Open!

176
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,559
- Come on.
- Come on.

177
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,440
- Big!
- Small!

178
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,080
Big!

179
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,559
What are you doing?

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,159
You're insane!

181
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Want to stab me?

182
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,679
Go ahead, stab!

183
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,000
Ye Yibo, let's die together!

184
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,960
Go to die!

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,440
Stab me!

186
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,159
Ye Yibo!

187
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's die together!

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,679
Stop it!

189
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,000
Let me go!

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,679
Kill me!

191
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,279
Ye Yibo!

192
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,720
Let's die together, Ye Yibo!

193
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,279
Let go now!

194
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,360
Release me!

195
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,759
You're crazy.

196
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,080
If you stabbed him,

197
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,279
your life would be ruined.

198
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,240
Do you understand?

199
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,039
Ye Yibo!

200
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,519
Ye Haitang!

201
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,159
Truly insane.

202
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,799
- Crazy!
- Crazy!

203
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,240
- Murder.
- Murder.

204
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,000
Ye Haitang.

205
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,279
Ye Haitang, what are you going to do?

206
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,759
Why did you stop me?

207
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,279
Why didn't you let me kill him?

208
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,960
You think you saved me?

209
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,519
Sorry. I don't want to thank you.

210
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,080
For that scum,

211
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,919
is it worth it?

212
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,799
It's worth it if he dies.

213
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,000
It's worth it if I die with him.

214
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
What gives you the right to stop me?

215
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,720
Does everyone have to keep living?

216
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,840
Why can't I die if I can't live on?

217
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,279
You can die.

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,759
But not for scum like him.

219
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,320
How I die is none of your business!

220
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,759
What right do you have?

221
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,000
Ye Haitang!

222
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,360
Your strength and courage
are just for death?

223
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,080
Yes!

224
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,200
Just for death!

225
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,519
Listen, Ye Haitang.

226
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,519
Ever used a knife?

227
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,720
That piece-of-junk blade
couldn't kill anyone!

228
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,799
Listen.

229
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,759
If you stabbed Ye Yibo today,

230
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,200
you'd just leave a scar on him.

231
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,279
But you?

232
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,080
Get locked up for years!

233
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,519
What's the point?

234
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
What about your education?

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
I stopped you today

236
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,799
not to get your thanks.

237
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,559
But since I did,

238
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,759
I'll see it through.

239
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Don't move.

240
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,873
(Public Security Bureau)

241
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,440
Sit here.

242
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,360
This is a knife assault case.

243
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,399
N-N-No injuries.

244
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,159
Look, look.

245
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,200
See?

246
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm completely fine.

247
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,200
"Fine"? Your daughter
chased you with a knife!

248
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,559
Trying to hurt you!

249
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,080
You need to explain this well.

250
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,080
My daughter's a victim, too.

251
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,759
She's ill.

252
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,960
What illness?

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,320
When she gets agitated,

254
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,679
she becomes suicidal.

255
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,240
She beats me with objects daily,

256
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,440
throws things, curses me,

257
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,480
and threatens to kill me.

258
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,759
I just lost control

259
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,919
and pushed her.

260
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,440
Now, she's like this.

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,200
All faults lead back to me.

262
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,759
I shouldn't have provoked her.

263
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,799
Sick people need treatment.

264
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,519
She's dangerous now.

265
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,799
What if she hurts someone?

266
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,200
Right.

267
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,080
Calling it some delusional disorder.

268
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,519
Hospitals can treat it.

269
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,240
Everyone urged me

270
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,000
to send her to a psychiatric hospital.

271
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,639
But I thought,

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
"She's my own daughter."

273
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,480
I couldn't bear
to make her suffer there.

274
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,840
Usually, she's completely normal.

275
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,000
Tang, don't be scared.

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,759
Ye Yibo, I'll kill you!

277
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,600
Ye Yibo!

278
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,559
Police station here!

279
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,600
Quiet! Settle down!

280
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,519
Police station here!

281
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,159
Ye Yibo!

282
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,279
Young man. Young man!

283
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm truly sorry.

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,720
I will cover your medical fees, okay?

285
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Don't press charges.

286
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,000
If she goes to jail,

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,159
her life is ruined.

288
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,200
I'm begging you.

289
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,080
If I go to jail,
you're gonna die with me!

290
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,200
Officer, we're classmates.

291
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,279
She's not like this!

292
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,480
She's usually really nice!

293
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,440
This is a mistake.

294
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
I will let it go.

295
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,759
Okay?

296
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:18,799
You're okay?

297
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,919
I'm really okay.

298
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,919
Or ask her dad.

299
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,759
They normally get along great!

300
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:23,960
She...

301
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,840
S-S-She's really okay!

302
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,679
After some sleep,

303
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,799
she'll be fine.

304
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:27,720
Well.

305
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,440
Let me take her

306
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,960
back home.

307
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,519
Is that okay?

308
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,559
Tang, stop it!

309
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,600
Go home.

310
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,320
Thank you.

311
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,480
It's okay. Go back.

312
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,720
Sleep it off and you'll feel better.

313
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,480
It's nothing.

314
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,240
If everything's fine, I'll leave now.

315
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,840
Wait a minute.

316
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,240
She's in this state.

317
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,679
You want to go back and provoke her?

318
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,080
No, no.

319
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,240
I won't provoke her.

320
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,039
Sit down here.

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,759
Sit.

322
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,039
I want to ask you a question.

323
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you often go to that mahjong parlor?

324
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,799
Why do you say I'm insane?

325
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,159
I am insane!

326
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,480
Do you believe I'll kill you too?

327
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,279
You're not insane.

328
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,200
I had to say that

329
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
to get you out.

330
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,519
Still go to school?

331
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,679
I want to die now.

332
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,919
I'll drag Ye Yibo to death with me!

333
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,360
Ye Haitang.

334
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,480
Dying is easy.

335
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,559
I won't stop you if you want to die.

336
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,279
But think carefully.

337
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,080
What have you lived this long for?

338
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
To die like this?

339
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,679
Would you really be content?

340
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,200
You don't understand anything.

341
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,720
You know nothing!

342
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:09,440
I know!

343
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,079
I know what kind of person Ye Yibo is

344
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,079
and how your life is!

345
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,359
Let's go back. I'll walk you home.

346
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,720
I really don't want to meddle.

347
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,319
But I think it's such a pity.

348
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,839
I've seen how you are at school.

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,039
You're different from me.

350
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,440
You can get into university and leave

351
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,000
this place.

352
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,519
I don't know why you're like this.

353
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,359
Did Ye Yibo do anything?

354
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,519
He took our class fund.

355
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,079
For just a few dozen yuan?

356
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,359
Do you think this is worth it?

357
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,000
The class fund isn't my money.

358
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,240
I can't repay it.

359
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,519
How do I explain this to Miss Tan?

360
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,359
How could I face my classmates?

361
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,039
I'll get that money back.

362
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,559
At worst, just say

363
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,559
that I took the class fund.

364
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,960
I'll explain it to Miss Tan.

365
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,039
Let's go.

366
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,680
We have school tomorrow.

367
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Does Ye Yibo smoke?

368
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,839
Someone's been here.

369
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,319
Probably debt collectors.

370
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,480
It's not safe here.

371
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:12,440
Go.

372
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm not afraid of them.

373
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,240
Those are Bao's men.

374
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,480
You'd rather die than be taken by them.

375
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,039
You know?

376
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,240
Go.

377
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,000
That's Ye Yibo's daughter, right?

378
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,440
You stay there!

379
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,200
- Don't run!
- Stop!

380
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,200
- Stop!
- Stop!

381
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,759
Come on!

382
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,759
Stop!

383
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,400
- Don't run!
- Stop!

384
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,160
Stop!

385
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:57,839
Stop!

386
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,279
Stop!

387
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
It's safe. Come out.

388
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,079
It's nothing.

389
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,160
Just some minor wounds.

390
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,559
Got anywhere to go?

391
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,519
Those people won't talk nicely

392
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,440
if they don't get their money.

393
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,519
Ye Yibo beats you daily.

394
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,200
Nobody intervenes?

395
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,319
A father disciplines his daughter.

396
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,319
Who can interfere?

397
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,440
My family came here from another place.

398
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,319
No ancestral hall.

399
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,160
Not even relatives or friends.

400
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,839
Calling the police?

401
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,720
You saw it.

402
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,839
I just got labeled as mentally ill.

403
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,240
All paths are blocked.

404
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,400
The only hope left for me

405
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,839
is to get into university
and leave this place.

406
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,799
No matter how Ye Yibo
beats or treats me,

407
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,960
I don't care.

408
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,759
At least at school,
I'm still treated like a normal person.

409
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,000
But now with this thing,

410
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,480
I've lost even my last shred of dignity.

411
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,720
Don't worry.

412
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,759
I'll figure out the class fund issue.

413
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,279
As for the love letter,

414
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,079
I'll deal with it for you.

415
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,519
These are my own things.

416
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,799
Don't worry.

417
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,960
I won't do anything stupid again.

418
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,559
You're right.

419
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,720
If I want to keep studying,

420
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,480
I have to endure this.

421
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,680
Where are you going?

422
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,680
Stay here tonight.

423
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,720
I'll go elsewhere.

424
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,440
Wait for me.

425
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,960
You really brought him home!

426
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,720
Get out now!

427
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,400
This toothpaste is expensive.

428
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,240
It costs three yuan.

429
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,960
Okay, this one.

430
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,640
Get me some snacks.

431
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,279
This.

432
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,480
Things for bathing.

433
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,599
A basin, a towel

434
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,480
and shampoo.

435
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,559
Okay, okay.

436
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,200
It's me.

437
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,119
These are newly bought for you.

438
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,359
The bathroom's over there.

439
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,319
The light's faulty.

440
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,319
It flickers at first

441
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,920
but works normally afterwards.

442
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,559
These bedsheets

443
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,720
were washed recently.

444
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,920
Completely clean.

445
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,680
And...

446
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,039
That's all.

447
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,480
I'm leaving.

448
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,000
I should really go.

449
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,480
Where will you go?

450
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,279
Ye Yibo must be home by now.

451
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,400
It's dangerous to go back.

452
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,039
Where can you stay?

453
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,920
Don't worry.

454
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,599
But your wound...

455
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,480
It's fine.

456
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,039
I've bandaged it already.

457
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,240
Go to bed early.

458
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:33,640
(Ticket Office)

459
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,839
What are you doing?

460
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,599
Stop pushing!

461
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,839
What are you doing here so late?

462
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,200
Your hand?

463
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,559
Nothing.

464
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,119
You returned the money?

465
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:52,880
Stay out of it.

466
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,680
This is the midnight snacks
for Zhenzhu?

467
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,359
Shrimp chips?

468
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,160
What are you talking about?

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,279
I'm here to watch tapes.

470
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,039
But you.

471
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,359
Why are you here so late?

472
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm here to watch tapes, too.

473
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,599
Go ahead.

474
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,559
Take this. I've got something to do.

475
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,440
Rat.

476
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,759
(Buddies Billiards)

477
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:27,599
Girl!

478
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,720
Girl!

479
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,400
- Coming.
- Change a tape.

480
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,160
Swap it for...

481
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,039
A Moment of...

482
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,200
A Moment of Romance?

483
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,039
Got it.

484
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,839
Hurry up.

485
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,880
Coming, coming!

486
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,839
Sir, a serving of fish noodles to go.

487
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,480
Use a bowl.

488
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,480
I'll return it.

489
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,319
Extra vegetables,

490
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,400
blanched crisp.

491
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,599
Sure, right away.

492
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,279
Thanks.

493
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,119
Sir.

494
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,200
Six bowls.

495
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,160
Alright.

496
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,759
Wait a second.

497
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,400
Hello, Qiang.

498
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:19,920
Hai.

499
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,720
Mr. Hao.

500
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,319
No, no! Just Hao is fine.

501
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,319
Having noodles?

502
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,920
Just getting takeout for myself.

503
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,480
This is pathetic.

504
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,880
Sharing one bowl with the other two?

505
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
No! It's all for me.

506
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,799
I'll treat you all

507
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,640
to noodles, okay?

508
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,799
That's too kind of you.

509
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:38,480
No, no, no.

510
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,160
Come.

511
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Sit here, please.

512
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,640
Sit over here, come on.

513
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:43,720
- Thanks, Mr. Hao.
- Thanks, Mr. Hao.

514
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,480
Just call me Hao.

515
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,200
- Thanks, Mr. Hao.
- Thanks, Mr. Hao.

516
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,839
The barbecue over there is good, too.

517
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,759
Let's order some.

518
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,119
Go ahead.

519
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,839
Sir!

520
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:51,960
Coming.

521
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,680
Do you know that cripple
from the tape shop?

522
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,759
Yeah, she's pretty and fresh-faced.

523
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,039
Too bad about her leg.

524
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,160
I've always had a question.

525
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,119
What is

526
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,720
the difference between banging

527
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,440
a cripple and a normal girl?

528
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,480
You.

529
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,279
Who would know that?

530
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,200
You don't know?

531
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,759
Thanks.

532
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,759
Listen.

533
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,079
Someone knows.

534
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,359
Rat.

535
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,039
How did you take a liking to Zhenzhu?

536
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,079
She walks unevenly.

537
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,839
You've got great taste.

538
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,680
Listen up.

539
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,039
I've never banged Zhenzhu,

540
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,440
but I can imitate her perfectly.

541
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:26,960
Show us.

542
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,359
Watch closely.

543
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,640
Isn't she just like this?

544
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,279
Down, up.

545
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,960
Down.

546
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
That leg.

547
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,440
Am I wrong?

548
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,279
That leg.

549
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,200
Get up.

550
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,279
Grab something.

551
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,680
Good mimicry.

552
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,119
Check your tickets.

553
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:39,480
Hold...

554
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,160
- Good mimicry.
- Yes!

555
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,920
Tomorrow, I'll go to the shop
to chat with Zhenzhu

556
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
to have some fun.

557
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,640
Just like her.

558
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,880
Let me try again.

559
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,759
Yeah.

560
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,920
That's exactly it.

561
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,039
Stop him.

562
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,440

(2026, Beixing City)

602
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,360
Why did you tear it?

603
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,840
We can't keep it.

604
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,800
I got it.

605
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,199
This is a suicide note.

606
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,280
Wait, how did this letter come about?

607
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,639
My dad's been waiting for this letter.

608
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Ye Haitang.

609
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,599

610
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:37,800
Stop analyzing it.

611
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,519
Listen.

612
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,320
I don't follow,

613
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
but I can responsibly tell you

614
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,199
that mailbox is cursed.

615
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,719
This letter isn't from a human.

616
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,719
If not human, then who? Cats?

617
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,239
This place is haunted.

618
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,119
There are spirits.

619
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,079
Got it?

620
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,559
Spirits.

621
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,360
You know superstitions
are backward thinking?

622
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,679
Then explain this to me.

623
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,639
What's really going on?

624
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,719
Officer Hu.

625
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,800
Did you find my dad?

626
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:02,880
Not yet.

627
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,239
If you're still awake,

628
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,239
come to register your dad's information.

629

Okay, I'm coming right now.

630
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,920
Miss, can I ask you a favor?

631
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,719
Don't tell anyone about this.

632
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,880
I worked so hard to get this city job.

633
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,519
I've told my mom

634
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,400
I'm a manager here.

635
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,880
If word gets out,

636
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,800
I'll lose my job.

637
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Cut me some slack, okay?

638
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,679
Please.

639
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,199

641
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,679
I agree to what you said.

642
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,280
If you see my dad, let me know.

643
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,320
Deal.

644
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:28,920
Alright.

645
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:29,599
No problem.

646
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,320
Okay.

647
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,599
Thank you.

648
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,840
Don't mention it.

649
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,400
Take care.

650
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,199
Yu Zhiyong, right?

651
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:52,719
Yes.

652
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,079
His ID number.

653
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
Officer, I don't have his ID number.

654
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,719
You don't know?

655
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,159
Okay.

656
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
We can use yours instead.

657
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,320
Your ID should work.

658
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
I think I carry it.

659
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,480
Here's my ID card.

660
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,360
This one.

Mother, Chen Qingfang.

663
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,559
Father, Yu Zhiyong.

664
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,199
You sure you're this person?

665
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes, I am.

666
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,920
Your father's missing?

667
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,800
Yes.

668
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,199
He went missing today?

669
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,559
Either this morning

670
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,719
or last night.

671
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,920
Around that time.

672
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,480
Listen, young lady.

673
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,719
Filing a false report
has legal consequences.

674
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,400
You understand?

675
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,360
Wait, officer.

676
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,239
I'm not lying.

677
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,119
My dad is missing.

678
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,719
Didn't we just watch the security video?

679
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,239
Look here.

(Yu Zhiyong, Nullified)

684
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,599
No, officer, there's a mistake.

685
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,639
The person in this photo

686
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,400
is not my father.

687
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,400
Our database is nationwide.

688
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,280
How could it be wrong?

689
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,239
I can't be mistaken either.

690
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,199
My dad raised me since childhood.

691
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,320
He was at home yesterday.

692
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,039
How could he

693
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,376
suddenly be in prison

694
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:15,480
and die over 20 years ago?

695
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,119
It's impossible.

696
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:16,800
How about this?

697
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,480
Do you have anything that proves

698
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,239
your so-called father's existence?

699
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,079
Officer,

700
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:21,920
so you mean

701
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,239
you still don't believe me?

702
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,480
My dad's really missing!

703
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,800
We were just watching the video!

704
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,679
You saw it too.

705
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,159
He disappeared on the footage.

706
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:28,760
How about this?

707
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,480
You go home.

708
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,599
Look for his ID card,
household registry,

709
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,440
or anything that proves his identity.

710
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Okay?

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,840
We'll expand our search area.
