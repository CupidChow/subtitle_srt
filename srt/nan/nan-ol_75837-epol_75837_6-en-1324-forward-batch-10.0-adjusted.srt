(2026, Beixing City)

2
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,480
Let me do it.

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,800
Be careful.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,280
Thank you.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,679
Nothing.

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:24,800
It's nothing.

7
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,880
Thank you.

8
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,519
Kitty, don't run away.

9
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,760
Kitty, don't run away.

10
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,439
Where's the kitten?

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Where's the kitten?

12
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:41,952

15
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,520
I always thought

16
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,240
these writings
came from genuine emotions.

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,599
Now that you mention it,

18
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,199
they do mirror our current situation.

19
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,680
Look,

20
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,159
daily fights and debt collection,

21
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,520
living in constant fear,

22
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,879
like weeds by the roadside.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
I really miss...

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,560
2026.

25
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll be in my fifties.

26
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,360
Why would I write this to you?

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
This is so bizarre.

28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,560
No.

29
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,879
I need to figure this out.

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,520
Why did it happen suddenly?

31
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,960
It all started with
that mailbox appearing.

32
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,719
After that mailbox showed up,

33
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,479
the love letter came,

34
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,280
then my suicide note,

35
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,800
Yu Nian's reply...

36
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,120
That mailbox is the key.

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,439
Where did that mailbox come from?

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,439
An old man collecting scrap.

39
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,680
He pulled a flatbed cart

40
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,479
with that mailbox on it.

41
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,039
Not sure if it's the same one

42
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,080
we know now.

43
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,560
But the day after he left,

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,840
the mailbox appeared.

45
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,719
An old man with a cart?

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,199
Was his hair gray?

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,599
Yes.

48
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,319
And very thin?

49
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,319
Extremely thin.

50
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,000
With a cat?

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,560
Yes.

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,959
I saw him at your doorstep, too.

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Pulling a cart

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
with a mailbox on it.

55
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,319
Also red-colored.

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,759
Strange. Why aren't we getting letters?

57
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,279
Maybe the time has passed?

58
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,720
No longer September on their end?

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,519
But if they don't reply,

60
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,439
we won't have

61
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,360
stationery to write on.

62
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,079
If the time over there

63
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,240
has pasted September 23rd,

64
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,120
what would they reply?

65
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,480
They'd call us scammers.

66
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,319
So it must not be

67
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,800
the time on their end.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,279
Don't worry. Let's wait longer.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,480
When will we get replies then?

70
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,920
This defies all logic.

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,759
There's no clear timeline at all.

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Now you believe in science.

73
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,959
Officer Hu?

74
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,120
We just got word.

75
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,959
Near a gas station in Wangjialing,

76
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,759
a car was found.

77
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,120
An elder with dementia was inside.

78
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,319
It's perhaps your father.

79
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,519
Go check immediately.

80
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,839
Okay. I'm coming now.

81
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,839
Seems they found my dad.

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,839
Found who?

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,360
My father.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,519
Quan,

85
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,639
do you have a car?

86
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,040
Your dad?

87
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,079
An old man,

88
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,600
thin with gray hair.

89
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
Pulling a cart

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,040
with a cat.

91
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,439
Probably a scrap collector.

92
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,079
A cat?

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
I've never seen anyone matching that.

94
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,680
Fully Gray-haired.

95
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:00,879
Nope.

96
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,279
No one that old here.

97
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,519
Any other recycling plants

98
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,360
nearby?

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,079
Mine's the only one in town.

100
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,800
I've never seen that person.

101
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,959
Try somewhere else.

102
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,120
Thank you.

103
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,600
I regularly sell paper scraps.

104
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
It's always been that middle-aged man.

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,160
I only saw that old man once.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,199
Maybe that old man

107
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,240
doesn't live in our town?

108
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,160
Both of us have seen him.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,519
The letters in the mailbox
all have our names.

110
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,199
This whole thing
is definitely targeting us.

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,279
Honestly,

112
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,360
I still can't believe this is real.

113
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,160
Even if it is real,

114
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,959
what does that even prove?

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,839
If they really are from the future,

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,439
I want to ask them

117
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,759
if I can get into college

118
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,120
and leave Meiwan.

119
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,639
You don't need to ask them.

120
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,639
Just ask me.

121
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,959
You'll definitely get in.

122
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,160
What about you?

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,680
I just want to know

124
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,199
if you will be doing well in the future.

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,079
What about yourself?

126
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,839
I haven't thought much about it.

127
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,319
But I always feel like the future

128
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,600
can't be anything good.

129
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,759
Even if bad things happen,

130
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,399
knowing in advance helps us avoid them.

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,519
You have a point.

132
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
Who exactly is Yu Nian?

133
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,519
I think she

134
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,240
might not know our future selves.

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Hard to tell.

136
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,720
From the tone of her letter,

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,639
I can sense

138
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,800
this communication
is crucial for her too.

139
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,680
Somehow, I instinctively trust her.

140
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
Like that love letter.

141
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,600
It didn't feel fake.

142
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,120
The car for hauling vegetables.

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,680
Awesome.

144
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,879
Don't damage the vegetables.

145
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,519
Got it.

146
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,680
Drive slowly.

147
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,600
There are many narrow roads.

148
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Watch out for big trucks.

149
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,199
Drive fast.

150
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,360
It's over 70 kilometers away.

151
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Be careful.

152
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,639
Let's talk when we're back.

153
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,800
Safe travels.

154
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,639
What are you doing?

155
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,199
I can't drive a manual.

156
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,320
Get out!

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,679
Why sit here if you can't drive?

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,039
Officer.

159
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,720
Officer.

160
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,720
Where's my dad?

161
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,519
In the car.

162
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,279
Dad.

163
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,039
Dad.

164
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,879
Not my father.

165
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
Not the one we're looking for.

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,879
Call 120.

167
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,600
On it.

168
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,360
Here.

169
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,480
It's cold.

170
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,240
Is my dad like that old man,

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,879
unable to say his own name

172
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,519
or where his home is?

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,279
On such a cold day,

174
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,840
is he dressed warmly enough?

175
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,559
Where did he go?

176
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
What if something happened?

177
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,840
Why did I argue with him?

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Why did I have to argue with him?

179
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,879
Dad.

180
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Where are you, Dad?

181
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,240
Why did I argue with him?

182
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,080
Dad.

183
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,440
Where are you, Dad?

184
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,639
Where are you, Dad?

185
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,519
It's so lively here.

186
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,879
Cha.

187
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
What are you here for?

188
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
Bao's worried about you guys.

189
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,480
He sent me to check in.

190
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,559
We brought fruits.

191
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,320
Hope you don't mind

192
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
if we share some fruits.

193
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,559
He's too kind. You can leave.

194
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,559
Cha.

195
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,279
Why say that?

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,919
This little shop

197
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,240
isn't worth continuing.

198
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,639
Bao said it.

199
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,639
We'll let bygones be bygones.

200
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,879
We're still in the same boat together.

201
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,399
Let's keep making money.

202
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,399
We're just battered soldiers now

203
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,879
and can't board your boat.

204
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,240
We don't want to hold you back.

205
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,919
You're complaining
we went too hard on you?

206
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,320
My leg's still lame.

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't blame you.

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,120
You don't understand?

209
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,879
Fine.

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,320
Let me put it simpler.

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,639
From now on,
we'll just run the pool hall

212
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,559
to make a living.

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,600
Your business has nothing to do with us.

214
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,519
Clear?

215
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,799
Want to do legitimate business now?

216
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Good.

217
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,600
I wish you a thriving business

218
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,759
and great prosperity

219
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,600
in advance.

220
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,440
Let's go.

221
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,799
Go, Fat Dog.

222
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,200
Enough.

223
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,639
Cha,

224
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,159
they really walk away like this?

225
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,879
We'll see.

226
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,799
At least, they can't force us.

227
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,200
Anyway, remember this.

228
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,519
Don't provoke them when you see them.

229
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,080
It's okay.

230
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,399
It's okay.

231
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:05,960
Back to work.

232
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,919
Xin.

233
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:18,759
Zhenzhu.

234
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,519
Miss Tan.

235
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,559
Have a seat.

236
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,080
You don't have to stand.

237
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
No. I'll just look around.

238
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,279
How about a drink?

239
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,639
No, thanks. You sit.

240
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,879
I'll just say a little.

241
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,679
Sit.

242
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,720
Tang Yixun.

243
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,519
Miss Tan.

244
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,559
To return to school,

245
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,600
agree to two conditions.

246
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,320
I agree.

247
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,480
I haven't told you.

248
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll accept anyway.

249
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,039
First,

250
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,960
study hard at school from now on.

251
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,759
Don't cause me any more trouble.

252
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,399
Tang promised me

253
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,320
she'd tutor you.

254
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,159
You two will improve together.

255
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
Deal. No problem.

256
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,519
Second,

257
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,879
no fighting outside school.

258
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,080
No associating

259
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,759
with punks.

260
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,960
If discovered,

261
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,799
instant expulsion.

262
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,679
Why are you looking at me?

263
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm a decent person.

264
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,440
Do you accept?

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,440
Yes.

266
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,320
Good.

267
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,039
I told the school.

268
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,399
Come back tomorrow.

269
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

270
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,200
- Thanks.
- No problem.

271
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,120
Carry on with your work.

272
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,840
I'm leaving.

273
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,919
Tang, tutor him.

274
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,559
Go home early.

275
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,360
Miss Tan.

276
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,519
Please stay.

277
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,039
Stay and try our boss's cooking.

278
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,879
He's an excellent cook.

279
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,840
Yes, Xin.

280
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,440
Stay and dine with us.

281
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,799
If it's good, eat a lot.

282
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,399
You and your silver tongue.

283
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,960
Spend time studying instead.

284
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,200
Xin.

285
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,360
Cha.

286
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,399
She's gone.

287
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,759
Long gone now.

288
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,519
What idiots!

289
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,919
Like I need your advice!

290
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,919
He's the shyest one.

291

Tang Yixun.

292
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,039
Didn't you go home to do homework?

293
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,920
Ye Yibo's back?

294
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,119
You're returning to school tomorrow.

295
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,400
I'll cut your hair.

296
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,480
Can you?

297
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Of course I can.

298
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,279
I cut my own hair all the time.

299
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,079

and Ye Yibo.

349
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,160
Grandma left me the house.

350
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,119
She wanted me to sell it
after getting into college

351
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,359

352

You're different.

362
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,039
You'll get into college.

363

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
recognize myself anymore.

387
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,400
You did a great job.

388
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,559
Thanks.

389
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,319
If what the letter says
about the 23rd is true,

390
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,960
let's ask Yu Nian

391
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,799
if we can get into the same college.

392
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:52,640
That...

393
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,119
No need to ask about this.

394
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:57,119
I won't get into your target university.

395
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,119
Another letter?

396
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,240
No.

397
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,960
This one's from me to you.

398
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,079
I'm going in.

399
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:50,920
Ye Haitang.

400
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,720
Tomorrow morning,

401
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,359
I'll pick you up.

402
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,759
Okay.

403
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,519
(To Tang Yixun)

404
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,119
(May we have the courage
to journey through mountains and seas)

405
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,440
(and the luck to witness the aurora.)

406
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,960
(Ye Haitang)

407
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,480
Ye Haitang.

408
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:41,920
Ye Haitang.

409
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,640
Ye Haitang.

410
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:41,248
(Meiyu Building)

411
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,480
I bought this for you. Eat.

412
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,039
Got a haircut?

413
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,119
Wow.

414
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,119
I thought you'd dropped out.

415
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
You stepped on my shoes!

416
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,000
My bad.

417
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,720
I didn't see them.

418
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,920
That's all?

419
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,200
You know how much they cost?

420
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,920
The only pair!

421
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,960
You can't pay for them!

422
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,599
I can't,

423
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,359
so I won't.

424
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,799
And don't mess with me.

425
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,960
You can't handle me.

426
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,200
You're threatening me?

427
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,720
Shen Xiaojun,

428
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:14,920
listen,

429
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,799
from now on,

430
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,480
let's get along well at school,

431
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,839
so we can graduate smoothly.

432
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,960
But after school,

433
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,200
it's hard to tell.

434
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,319
This part is meant to scare you.

435
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,759
Remember this.

436
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,240
Has Ye Haitang not arrived?

437
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,759
She might be here soon.

438
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,119
Class dismissed.

439
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:54,559
Stand up.

440
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,880
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

441
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,720
Alright, goodbye.

442
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,200
Miss Tan.

443
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,359
Why didn't Ye Haitang come today?

444
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,079
She took a few sick days.

445
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:17,960
Sick leave?

446
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:19,720
What sick leave?

447
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,960
Her dad requested it

448
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,839
this morning.

449
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,920
Her father?

450
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,519
Where are you going?

451
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,519
I'm taking leave, too.

452
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,680
It's your first day back today.

453
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,400
Tang Yixun!

454
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,519
Ye Haitang!

455
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,720
Ye Yibo!

456
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,400
Ye Yibo!

457
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,680
Ye Yibo!

458
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:57,720
Ye Yibo!

459
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,559
What's your problem?

460
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,440
Who? What's going on?

461
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,119
Ye Yibo?

462
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,200
Haven't seen him.

463
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,279
Was he here recently?

464
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,400
With unpaid debts

465
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,559
and new ones now,

466
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,240
how could he come?

467
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,720
Three against one?

468
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:16,839
This.

469
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,160
Hello.

470
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,640
Is this the Fenghua Sugar Factory?

471
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,319
May I speak to Ye Yibo?

472
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,119
I... I am...

473
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,200
I'm his relative.

474
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,240
He's on leave?

475
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:31,839
When?

476
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,160
Okay.

477
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,960
Thank you.

478
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,039
Sir.

479
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:50,759
(Meiwan Police Station)

480
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,680
Take it easy.

481
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,319
Speak slowly.

482
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,440
What are you to Ye Haitang?

483
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,559
Classmate.

484
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,799
Classmate?

485
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,079
Yeah.

486
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,839
Does the school know

487
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,559
she's missing?

488
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,160
Her dad asked for leave,

489
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,440
but he's suspicious.

490
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,039
What's wrong with her father?

491
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,680
Give this to Liu.

492
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,319
Got it.

493
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
You are the girl's classmate

494
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,440
from last time, right?

495
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,720
Yes.

496
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:13,880
What's wrong?

497
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
He reported his classmate missing,

498
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,240
but

499
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,200
the parent already notified the school.

500
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Same girl as before?

501
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:21,680
Yes.

502
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,240
Did her dad take her to the hospital?

503
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,559
They say she has delusions.

504
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,759
Treatable.

505
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,839
Many tell me to send her
to a psychiatric hospital.

506
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,240
Mr. Chen!

507
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,920
Let me borrow your bike.

508
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:41,880
Let me use it.

509
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:42,759
Alright.

510
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,359
Calm down.

511
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,319
Return it tonight, Xun.

512
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:46,880
Okay.

513
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,680
Make way.

514
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:27,408
(Mental Rehabilitation Center)

515
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,799
Tang.

516
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,160
Don't blame me for being harsh.

517
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,519
It's for your own good.

518
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
They'll feed you.

519
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,039
Focus on getting better.

520
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,319
Wait till I sell the house

521
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,240
and win big.

522
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,160
I'll come back for you.

523
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:54,680
Tang.

524
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,119
We're here now.

525
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,039
Go along.

526
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,960
Let me untie you.

527
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,119
No more outbursts, okay?

528
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,240
Work with the doctors.

529
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,400
Stay still. Isn't this better?

530
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,559
I'm fine, really.

531
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,359
My child is ill.

532
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,319
Why hit me again?

533
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,400
It's okay.

534
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,160
My child is ill.

535
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,319
I'm here with you.

536
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,920
It's alright.

537
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:18,839
We're here.

538
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,400
We're here.

539
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,559
We're at the hospital.

540
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,240
Ye Haitang!

541
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,559
Ye Yibo!

542
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,359
We're here.

543
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Ye Yibo!

544
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,559
Raising your hand against me?

545
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:42,960
Ye Yibo!

546
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,759
Ye Yibo!

547
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
You're an animal!

548
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,960
You hit me?

549
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm her father!

550
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,160
I make the rules!

551
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,640
I'll do whatever I want!

552
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,680
You can't stop me!

553
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,400
Ye Yibo!

554
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,279
What did she do wrong?

555
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,759
Why treat her like this?

556
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,920
She tried to stab me!

557
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,799
She tried to kill me!

558
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,039
To stab me to death!

559
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,519
Go ahead! Kill me!

560
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,759
Come on, Ye Yibo!

561
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,039
- Stop it!
- Stop!

562
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:23,880
No more fighting!

563
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,839
He will die!

564
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,640
Ye Yibo!

565
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:26,839
He will die!

566
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:27,960
Let go!

567
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,480
Stop fighting!

568
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,160
Ye Yibo!

569
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,839
You beast!

570
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,720
Do it! Kill me!

571
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,640
Ye Yibo!

572
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,720
My own daughter tried to stab me!

573
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,799
She brought

574
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,799
this punk to kill me!

575
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,000
Come on! Kill me!

576
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,759
Don't you run!

577
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,960
Stay right there!

578
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,799
You beast!

579
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,640
Ye Yibo!

580
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Stop!

581
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,200
Don't run away!

582
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,240
Get lost!

583
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,559
Ye Haitang.

584
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,720
I'm sorry.

585
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,359
I'm sorry.

586
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:15,839
I'm sorry.

587
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,279
I'm sorry.

588
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,640
Let's go home.

589
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,599
Let's go home.

That monster.

You're his daughter.

602
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,440
How can he do that?

603
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,079
He resents my mom.

604
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,840
He said she was promiscuous

605
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,679
and seduced men.

606
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,519
Still want fish cakes?

607
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,639
It's too far.

608
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,320
I will make tomato egg noodles tonight.

609
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,639
Your mom will be back soon.

610
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,599
Mom.

611
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,800
Ye.

612
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,239
Why are you home today?

613
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,440
Day off today.

614
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,239
Coming back to cook.

615
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,280
Go ahead.

616
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,079
Alright.

617
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:11,920
Where are you going?

618
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,719
Explain yourself today!

619
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,159
You sold yourself
for a can of malted milk?

620
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:18,920
Mom.

621
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,960
Bo.

622
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,679
What are you doing now?

623
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,960
Mom, stay out of this!

624
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,519
Speak clearly!

625
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:24,960
Tang.

626
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:25,880
Mom!

627
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,760
Let's go.

628
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,719
Mom!

629
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,239
I saw it today.

630
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,559
You got out of his car
at the alley entrance.

631
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,880
Have you no shame?

632
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,039
All for a can of malted milk?

633
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,840
Ye Yibo, stop talking nonsense.

634
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,920
We're just ordinary friends.

635
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,400
He gave me this just to show

636
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,079
his gratitude.

637
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:42,719
Mom!

638
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,920
Was it that man?

639
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,639
The malted one?

640
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,480
Is it him?

641
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,079
Ye Yibo, stop talking nonsense!

642
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,000
Out with it!

643
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,840
Mom, I'm home.

644
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,039
Give me your dress.

645
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,719
Who paid for it?

646
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:58,760
I bought it.

647
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,960
But I've never seen it.

648
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,280
I bought it.

649
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,239
Where did you get the money to buy this?

650
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,360
Who gave you the money?

651
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,400
Who paid for this?

652
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,239
Who?

653
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,559
I saved it myself.

654
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,400
Mom.

655
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,199
You seduced another man, right?

656
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,199
Who did you seduce?

657
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,920
Get inside!

658
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,519
Mom!

659
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,360
Explain yourself!

660
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,079
Go out with me.

661
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:21,760
Go, hurry.

662
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,159
Which man did you seduce this time?

663
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,079
I didn't.

664
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:24,559
Go.

665
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,519
Mom.

666
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,280
You didn't?

667
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,400
My mom wasn't that kind of person.

668
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,239
He's the mentally ill one.

669
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,719
Whenever my mom spoke to other men,

670
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,760
he'd fly into rage.

671
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,639
Later, he gambled.

672
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,639
When he lost,

673
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,199
he'd come home
and beat my mom even worse

674
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,960
until she couldn't bear it

675
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,039
and ran away from home.

676
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,760
He couldn't find her,

677
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,079
so he took his anger out on me.

678
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,039
Didn't the factory leaders intervene?

679
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:53,760
Didn't you

680
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,119
think about talking to them?

681
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,599
They worked at the same place.

682
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,199
My mom was the cashier.

683
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,880
She took the factory funds
when she left.

684
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,519
Ye Yibo cried and said

685
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,840
he'd repay this money.

686
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,400
The factory leaders were moved.

687
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,559
Tang, it's still hot.

688
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,559
Wait for it to cool down.

689
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,599
I don't mind,

690
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,760
but she needs to eat.

691
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,039
Ye.

692
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,519
This isn't a small amount of money.

693
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,679
Director Wei,

694
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,840
I'll repay this money.

695
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,360
I've discussed it with Secretary Liu.

696
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,719
I'll write an IOU.

697
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,280
Deduct it from my wages later.

698
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,360
I won't default.

699
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,480
Then how will you and your family eat?

700
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:39,239
No, I...

701
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,039
I can manage the hardships.

702
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,039
Tang and I eat simply.

703
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,679
Just let me keep a little

704
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,800
for my mom's medical bills.

705
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,679
There's been no news
of Wu Fengying at all?

706
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,480
Her hometown relatives are all gone.

707
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,159
I don't know where to look for her.

708
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,159
How about this?

709
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
Write me an IOU.

710
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,719
If you can repay the money,

711
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,599
the factory won't press charges.

712
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,639
Director Wei,
I'll definitely repay this.

713
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,800
I'll come to your office tomorrow.

714
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,360
Thank you.

715
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,079
I'll be going.

716
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,320
Take care of the child.

717
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,000
Goodbye, Ye.

718
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,679
Take care.

719
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,599
He never spoke ill of my mom

720
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,239
in front of others.

721
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,159
He always said it was his poverty

722
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,920
that made her suffer so much.

723
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
All these years, everyone

724
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,440
saw him repaying

725
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,880
the debts, raising me through hardships,

726
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,559
and caring for
my grandma in the hospital.

727
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,360
When the sugar factory caught fire,

728
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,719
he rushed into the flames alone,

729
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,920
saving over a dozen people.

730
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,800
The factory paraded in with an award.

731
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,119
He stood in the hall,

732
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,199
wearing a red flower,

733
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,920
solemnly vowing to be

734
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,960
a just and courageous man.

735
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,519
Whenever my neighbors needed help,

736
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:33,360
if he was home,

737
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
he'd assist them.

738
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,199
Those who tried matchmaking for him

739
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,280
all got turned down.

740
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,360
He said he'd not let me be mistreated

741
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,440
by a stepmother.

742
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,599
I told people Ye Yibo was a bad person.

743
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,280
Who'd believe that?

744
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,360
Scum.

745
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,360
Worse than an animal.

746
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,519
Every time I fought back,

747
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,639
it only made things worse for me.

748
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,920
I ran out and told people many times,

749
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,079
but he always claimed
I was mentally ill.

750
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,480
He even consulted doctors

751
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,679
and learned a term called

752
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,840
delusional disorder.

753
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,760
Everyone said my mom ran away.

754
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,039
I was insane.

755
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,239
Since childhood,

756
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,840
I've never seen my father.

757
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,280
My mom told me then

758
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:36,960
she'd go find my dad

759
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,519
and come get me when she found him.

760
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,800
But after that day,

761
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,960
I never saw her again.

762
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,039
I was only 4 years old then.

763
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,280
I was in our house,

764
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,480
nearly starving to death.

765
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,719
Then I went out

766
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,679
to scavenge food from trash bins.

767
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,960
Later on,

768
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,880
I got sent to an orphanage.

769
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,360
My parents left me nothing.

770
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,599
Not even a proper name.

771
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,199
I only knew myself as Xun.

772
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,559
My current name

773
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,960
was given by Chubby Auntie
at the orphanage.

774
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,039
Chubby Auntie is Miss Tan's mother.

775
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,159
That was when I realized

776
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,639
my birth parents

777
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,159
never cared about me at all.

778
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,039
So whether I become a wolf

779
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,199
or a dog,

780
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,519
I have to survive.

781
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,559
Did you ever go back to search?

782
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:14,639
Maybe your mom
came back looking for you?

783
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,199
Of course I went back.

784
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,440
But the old house had collapsed.

785
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,400
She never came back at all.

786
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,519
Without Chubby Auntie,

787
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:30,736
I would have starved to death.

788
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:34,559
No wonder Miss Tan
worries about you so much.

789
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:41,119
Both Miss Tan and Chubby Auntie

790
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,320
have always told me

791
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,960
to study hard

792
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:46,599
and gain more knowledge,

793
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,239
so I could succeed in the future.

794
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,719
But I did study hard.

795
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,920
My classmates all looked down on me.

796
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,880
They called me a stray dog

797
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,840
and threw my books in the toilet.

798
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,039
I couldn't take it,

799
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,480
so I fought back.

800
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,280
Then I got sent to reform school.

801
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,079
Xin never gave up on me.

802
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:18,920
Through her,

803
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,280
I met Cha.

804
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,719
But Xin always thought

805
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,119
Cha was a bad influence.

806
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,079
She felt guilty about it

807
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,800
and kept pushing me to return to school

808
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,880
and focus on studies.

809
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,960
Were they together before?

810
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:36,039
Yes.

811
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:38,960
Xin used

812
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,639
to attend a normal college in the city.

813
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:43,199
Cha would bike

814
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,360
to visit her every week.

815
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,760
Riding a bicycle

816
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,960
for five or six hours.

817
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:50,559
But later,

818
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,119
Xin thought Cha took the wrong path

819
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,800
and was crooked,

820
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,039
so they broke up.

821
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,719
Cha isn't that bad.

822
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,119
Right?

823
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,840
He's a good person.

824
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,440
He just never got proper schooling.

825
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
He's uncultured,

826
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:20,480
so he

827
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,039
couldn't find decent work.

828
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,360
He can only do what he knows how to do.

829
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,519
Same with Rat.

830
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:29,840
He's not bad.

831
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,079
His dad was a murderer.

832
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:39,480
When his dad got locked up,

833
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,599
he and his mom
became outcasts in the village.

834
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,400
His mom couldn't take the bullying

835
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
and killed herself.

836
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,239
As for Rat,

837
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:03,360
he's lived feeling ashamed,

838
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,039
like he's inferior to others,

839
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,280
so he doesn't go to school.

840
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,880
Just wandering around.

841
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:18,159
Why are there
so many unfortunate people in the world?

842
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,159
Living like weeds,

843
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:24,760
easy to be crushed underfoot.

844
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:32,920
You asked me before

845
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,880
why I grabbed your knife.

846
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:42,960
No reason.

847
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,599
Just to help you.

848
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:47,320
I wanted you to live.

849
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:53,039
We hopeless folks

850
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:54,960
are still hanging on.

851
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,199
You did nothing wrong.

852
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,360
And you've tried so hard.

853
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,320
So you deserve to live well.

854
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,519
Thank you

855
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,159
for keeping me alive.

856
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,599
When I was injured before,

857
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,360
you kicked at my door.

858
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,440
Seeing how worried you looked

859
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,159
made me think

860
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:33,239
this must be
what having family felt like.

861
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:41,960
Ye Haitang.

862
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:48,159
I want to be your family,

863
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,360
if you let me.

864
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,199
Let's live well.

865
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,320
Okay.

866
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,360
We'll live well.

867
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:08,639
Okay.

868
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,079
Live well.

869
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:14,519
Live well.

870
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,719
Millet porridge.

871
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,480
Any else?

872
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,159
Corn.

873
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:54,840
Seek for.

874
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,519
Both mean "seeking".

875
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:57,400
What's the difference?

876
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,840
"In search of"

877
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,199
means seeking hard.

878
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:02,000
It emphasizes the active effort.

879
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,199
What follows it?

880
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:05,320
In search of a job.

881
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,320
Or what you all crave.

882
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,639
In search of freedom.

883
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,960
After the examination,
you'll all be free.

884
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,119

By Euclidean geometry,

911
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:12,039
AC squared equals AD multiplied by AB.

912
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,320
Given AD is 3 units

913
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,679
and AB is 4 units,

914
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:19,079
so AC squared is 3 multiplied by 4.

915
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,679
So x squared equals 12,

916
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:22,440

00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:23,480
Is it tomorrow or the day after?

961
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,400
Or beyond?

962
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,199
Just not today.

963
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:31,960
Look!

964
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,079
There's a dragon!

965
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:34,960
Such a huge dragon!

966
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,159
What's going on?

967
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,320
Have you ever seen this before?

968
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:52,960
(Hello, Yu Nian,)

969
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,039
(at our local dock,)

970
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:55,800
(a waterspout phenomenon did occur.)

971
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,840
(Now is)

972
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,920
(September 23rd, 1991.)

973
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,360
(I can't believe I'm writing)

974
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,000
(to a person from 2026.)

975
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:05,280
(I did receive a letter,)

976
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,760
(but it wasn't from Yu Zhiyong.)

977
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,000
(And I don't know him.)

978
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:10,440
(I'm sorry the letter was already torn.)

979
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,519
(I don't know where Beixing City is.)

980
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,199
(At midnight,)

981
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,760
(when a cat jumps
onto the mailbox, letters arrive.)

982
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,280
(Please explain what all this means.)

983
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:20,440
(Ye Haitang)

984
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,519
(1991)

985
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:22,639
(September 23rd)

986
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:25,440
Are you sure

987
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,719
she's your mother?

988
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,280
I can't confirm yet.

989
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,280
She mentioned receiving a letter before,

990
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,119
but it wasn't from your father.

991
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:41,960
Exactly.

992
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,960
How could my dad write a love letter?

993
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,239
The mailbox connects two timelines.

994
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,960
May be others also discovered it.

995
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,280
We aren't the only ones.

996
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,480
Maybe others are doing the same?

997
00:54:58,639 --> 00:54:59,239
Or perhaps

998
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,599
not just two mailboxes?

999
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,000
You mean it could be crossed?

1000
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,559
Right.

1001
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,480
So perhaps

1002
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,039
others could join this correspondence.

1003
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,239
If that's really the case,

1004
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:13,599
things just got more complicated.

1005
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:16,920
I need to first

1006
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,079
confirm if she is my mom.

1007
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,360
Stay out of this reply.

1008
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:23,239
Why?

1009
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:24,880
Even now,

1010
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,679
you don't trust me?

1011
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,239
I apologize for doubting you before.

1012
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,960
I hope you understand how I felt then.

1013
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,760
To verify if the sender

1014
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,960
is truly Ye Haitang,

1015
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:35,440
I'll ask something

1016
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,880
only my mom and I would know.

1017
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,800
So I'll write this letter alone.

1018
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,119
I'll mail it myself.

1019
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:44,199
Okay?

1020
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:46,559
Fine.

1021
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,599
Coming!

1022
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,800
Well? Did it work?

1023
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,639
Did it work?

1024
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:21,880
Explain what happened.

1025
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,320
I'm going to Pushui.

1026
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:25,760
They found my mom.
