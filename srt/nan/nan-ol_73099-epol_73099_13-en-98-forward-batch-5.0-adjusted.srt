00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,080
Look at my radish, so fresh.

4
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,920
These greens are super fresh too.

-They do look fresh.

Song was right after all.

9
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,479
He really came back to life.

10

12

His leg was broken.

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,640
How could he be working here

14
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,970

15

I heard Her Ladyship went in to see him,

16
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,980

17
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,680
Do you think

18
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,560

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,560
What kind of method
could heal a broken leg

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
and bring him back from the dead?

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,960

she must've used some dark arts.

Not human?

25

You know full well that
altering a mortal's fate with magic

would you also stop to help it?

00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,270
[Execute]

335
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,560
Lord Meng is a good official!

336
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,680
You can't kill him!

337
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,660
No, please!

338
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,440
No! No!

339
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,320
Don't kill him!

340
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,030
Step back! Step back!

341
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,510
Back off! Don't push!

342
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,450
Don't kill him!

343
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,570
Step back!

344
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,070
Such good wine.

345
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,800
What a waste!

346
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,400
Step back.

347
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,000
Lord Meng!

348
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Don't go forward.

349
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,840
Step back.

350
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,940
Lord Meng! Lord Meng!

351
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,580
No!

352
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,680
Stop! You can't do this!

353
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,120
Back off, back off!

354
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,950
No!

355
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,560
Lord Meng.

356
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,520
Step back!

357
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
Lord Meng! Lord Meng!

358
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,370
Execute him! Now!

359
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
No! Stop!

360
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,870
No!

361
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,480
You…

362
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,560
Meng Changqin?

363
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,230
That's me.

364
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,970
Meng Chi's grandson.

365
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,920
Lord Meng.

366
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,060
He's gone.

367
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,840
Where is Lord Meng?

368
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
Sir, what should we do now?

369
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,400
What else can we do?
Put out an arrest warrant!

370
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
Bring Meng Changqin back to me!

371
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,410
[Order]

372
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,010
[Bai Jiusi]

373
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,290
[Bai Jiusi]

374
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,970
I went out to take care of something.

375
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,370
Don't look for me.
I'll be back in a few days.

376
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,280
This is...

377
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,410
Are you an immortal?

378
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,760
Or a demon?

379
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
You just mentioned my grandfather.

380
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,380
Do you know him?

381
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
What's your relationship with him?

382
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
You're not my grandmother, are you?

383
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,430
I've never met her.

384
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,400
I only heard my grandfather say

385
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,760
she was a gentle beauty.

386
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,760
You kinda match the description.

387
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,560
Are you okay?

388
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,060
Using magic to rewrite a mortal's fate

389
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,670
comes with consequences.

390
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,739
Where are you going?

391
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,420
None of your business.

392
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,739
Then where should I go?

393
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,320
That's none of my concern.

394
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm a wanted man now.

395
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,320
Just do me another favor

396
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
and point me in the right direction.

397
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,370
Are you okay?

398
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,350
Told you to take me with you,

399
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,570
but you refused.

400
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,800
See? If it weren't for me,

401
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,480
you'd have been torn apart by wild dogs.

402
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,460
But no need to thank me.

403
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,670
You saved my life,

404
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,510
and I saved yours.

405
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,700
We're even now.

406
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,250
We don't owe each other anything anymore.

407
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,620
Smells amazing.

408
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,900
I'm telling you,

409
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,970
my roast rabbit is next-level.

410
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,040
I learned it young
while wandering mountains.

411
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,190
After you eat it,

412
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,770
you have to take me with you.

413
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,960
So noisy.

414
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,680
Better than being boring
and silent like you.

415
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,320
Here.

416
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,510
I'll pass.

417
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,050
Just take it.

418
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,040
As an enlightened one, don't act

419
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,550
all shy and coy.

420
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,120
What did you do?

421
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,720
I didn't do anything.

422
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,520
Then why were they going to execute you?

423
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,910
Because I'm upright
and selfless, that's why.

424
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,940
What's wrong with an official
being upright and selfless?

425
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,830
I'm not wrong.

426
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,640
The problem is this rotten,

427
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,070
chaotic bureaucracy.

428
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,130
I refused to be corrupted like them,

429
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,220
so they framed me.

430
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,080
The officials in that mess of a system

431
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,410
spend all day scheming and backstabbing.

432
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,880
How boring.

433
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,150
I planned to quit anyway.

434
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,620
I'll start cultivation with you.

435
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,280
Once I become an immortal,

436
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,320
I'll go straight back to Huai'an County

437
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,100
to beat those crooked officials
into a pulp.

438
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,160
Then I'll point at…

439
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,760
I'll point right at the emperor's nose

440
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,160
and call him a blind fool.

441
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,520
He couldn't even recognize my talent.

442
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,160
No wonder he's getting manipulated

443
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,340
by a bunch of schemers.

444
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:34,940
Bah!

445
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,080
What?

446
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,640
Do you also think
I'm exceptionally talented

447
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,780
and brilliantly gifted?

448
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,510
Wanna take me as your disciple?

449
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,910
I just think

450
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,720
you're nothing like your grandfather.

451
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,780
Of course not.
My grandfather was never this handsome.

452
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,800
This is the money
I prepared for my burial.

453
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
Once the city gates open tomorrow,

454
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,640
I'll treat you to a feast.

455
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,320
After that, I'm officially your disciple.

456
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,840
You've already
prepared money for your burial?

457
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,560
Of course.

458
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,560
When I joined the county office,

459
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,190
I brought a coffin with me

460
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,120
to show I'd never bow to those in power.

461
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,570
It's just politics,

462
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,520
but you make it sound worse than hell.

463
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,660
You don't understand.

464
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,850
Once people get caught up
in power and status,

465
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,040
they can be way worse
than any hell you can imagine.

466
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,900
How about I tell you the wild story

467
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,500
of what I went through back then?

468
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,360
Boring.

469
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,190
Boring.

470
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,000
Everyone, may I have your attention?

471
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,200
Do you know what caused the drought
thousands of miles away

472
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,550
in the north?

473
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,210
What caused it?

474
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,300
Yeah.

475
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,430
What caused it?

476
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,730
The Drought Dragon in the north!

477
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,890
The Drought Dragon?

478
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,610
It was the mount of Nüba.

479
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,240
Back then, it was sealed with Nüba

480
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,600
north of the Chishui River
by the Yellow Emperor.

481
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,290
But now it has escaped.

482
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,080
Wherever it goes,
the land for miles around

483
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,810
is left cracked and parched.

484
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,080
Springs dry up,
and not a single crop grows.

485
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
After all this talk,

486
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,460
what can you actually do about it?

487
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,290
Yeah, do you have any solution?

488
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,480
Of course.

489
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,620
There's only one thing in this world
that can slay the Drought Dragon.

490
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,470
What is it?

491
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,060
It's this Xuanze Saber.

492
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,800
Forged from the shell
of the ancient divine beast,

493
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,320
the Xuan Tortoise,

494
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,720
tempered by storm winds
and soul-freezing ice,

495
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,840
this saber
can summon wind and rain when drawn.

496
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,480
It can surely kill the dragon.

497
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,200
It's so powerful!

498
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,320
If it's so powerful,

499
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,880
why don't you go kill the dragon yourself?

500
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,140
The sword has a spirit.

501
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,800
It chooses its own master.

502
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,690
Only someone really powerful
can control it.

503
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,360
I'm just a normal Daoist,

504
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,480
not nearly powerful enough to wield it.

505
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,000
You just made that up, didn't you?

506
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,240
You're just lying.

507
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,880
Instead of listening to his nonsense,

508
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
we'd be better off
praying to the Dragon King.

509
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,960
Wait, let me explain…

510
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,400
Wait.

511
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,250
Let's go.

512
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,480
Wait, wait.

513
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,430
Sir, sir.

514
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:44,920
Sir.

515
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,480
Sir.

516
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:46,920
What?

517
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,610
You and I must be fated to meet.

518
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,210
I charge others 700 coppers,

519
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,360
but for you, just 500. What do you think?

520
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,200
-No.
-Hold on.

521
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,470
300 coppers. This is below cost.

522
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,040
300?

523
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,480
What do you think?

524
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,000
Still no.

525
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,480
Come on.

526
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,460
Sir, sir.

527
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,860
[For Sale]

528
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,260
[For Sale]

529
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,320
Stop, stop.

530
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,350
Stop.

531
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,570
You're for sale?

532
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,030
I'm Zhu.

533
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
I can cook, raise livestock,

534
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,600
and do needlework.

535
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,130
I can help clean your house.

536
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,880
All I ask is two sacks of rice.

537
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,900
You're not young anymore.

538
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,260
You're not worth much.

539
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,880
But this one here…

540
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,620
M-My daughter is not for sale.

541
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,790
Only myself.

542
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,750
I told you, you're worthless.

543
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,340
No one would trade
even a sack of rice for you.

544
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,320
But your daughter looks great.

545
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,820
She's cute and pretty.

546
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,940
She could fetch two sacks of rice.

547
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,040
Sir, I don't sell my children.

548
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
Please, spare her.

549
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,080
I said I want her, and I will have her!

550
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,480
Come with me!

551
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,840
-Sir!
-You bad guy! Go away!

552
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,400
Let go of me!

553
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,720
Sir, please let her go!

554
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,450
Sir.

555
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,360
Sir.

556
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
You dare bite me?

557
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,640
Sir.

558
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,120
Not taking the easy way out, huh?

559
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,000
Help!

560
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,120
-Sir.
-I'm not leaving.

561
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,800
-Please let her go.
-Guards!

562
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,180
Get this little girl onto the carriage!

563
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,760
Let me go!

564
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,240
I'll make sure
you don't get a single grain of rice!

565
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,080
Sir!

566
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,420
Take this!

567
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,290
You scum, I'll beat you to death!

568
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,160
Why are you so useless?

569
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,380
Go get him!

570
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,740
What are you waiting for? Go beat him!

571
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:58,990
Beat…
