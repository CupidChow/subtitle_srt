[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,460
Senior.

4
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,890
What illness does Xinlan actually have?

5
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,890
Is it something even you can't cure?

6
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,050
What she has is

7
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,420
a congenital deficiency
she's had since birth.

8
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,890
I wrote to our master about it,

9
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,890
and he confirmed that
my prescription is correct.

10
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,550
It's just that her body is too frail,

11
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,979
so the effect is a bit slow.

12
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,910
Winter is especially hard for her.

13
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,060
Sometimes, she sleeps for days;

14
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,170
other times when she wakes up,

15
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,700
she can't fall back asleep.

16
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,450
With you here, Senior,

17
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,509
I'm sure Xinlan will get better soon.

18
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,660
Thank you for your kind words, Junior.

19
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,850
Here.

20
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,310
Thank you, Senior.

21
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,670
Why did Senior buy such a large residence?

22
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,300
Xinlan is in poor health,

23
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,970
and logically speaking,

24
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,630
a lack of vitality isn't conducive
to recovery.

25
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,090
Look at these rooms.

26
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,570
They're specifically used by Senior

27
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,020
to shelter those poor patients.

28
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,410
It may seem quiet here now,

29
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,370
but that's only because
they've all recovered and gone home.

30
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,780
It's just a temporary lull.

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,440
No wonder the villagers
all respect Senior so much.

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,750
Senior's actions

33
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,980
truly deserve the words
"Benevolent Heart, Benevolent Skills."

34
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,660
[Benevolent Heart]

35
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,250
Senior comes from a prestigious family,

36
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,570
with exceptional medical skills
and no desire for fame.

37
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,900
He always focuses on researching incurable
diseases that others can't treat,

38
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,000
which is why his name remains low-profile.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
If Xinlan weren't so ill
and unable to travel,

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,370
he would probably

41
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,740
be traveling everywhere like me,

42
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,400
searching for rare and unusual diseases.

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
It's truly a pity.

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,410
I hope Senior's devotion

45
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,740
will move the heavens,

46
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,620
allowing the two of them
to grow old together.

47
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,410
Don't run! Stop right there!

48
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,790
What's that place over there?

49
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,760
I think it's Senior's herb garden.

50
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,250
Help! Someone's stealing herbs!

51
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,130
Help!

52
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,000
Song!

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,940
Mr. Sun!

54
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,340
-Someone was stealing herbs here!
-What happened?

55
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,300
Someone was stealing herbs!

56
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,570
The medicinal herbs Master worked so hard
to grow

57
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,740
have all been ruined by the thief!

58
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,850
Mr. Dong will surely scold me again
if he finds out.

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,810
Where's the thief?

60
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,650
I failed to catch up with him.

61
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,710
He climbed over the wall and escaped!

62
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,740
Take me to see.

63
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,100
It's right over there!

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,810
Right there.

65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Was it this patch?

66
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:05,970
This patch?

67
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,030
Yes. That's right.

68
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,340
This...

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,100
That person wasn't here for the herbs.

70
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
But I saw him bending over right there
with my own eyes.

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,960
If he wasn't stealing herbs,
then what was he doing?

72
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,560
If he were here to steal herbs,

73
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,690
he should have at least taken
some herbs away.

74
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,130
But the herbs in the garden

75
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,260
were all just trampled and knocked over.

76
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,860
Judging by the roots and stems,

77
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,260
there's no sign of them
being uprooted or harvested, either.

78
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,620
When you saw him,

79
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,180
he might have just climbed over the wall

80
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,980
and was about to stand up,

81
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,440
rather than bending down.

82
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,370
Junior, you're truly impressive.

83
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,020
No wonder that brat Yan...

84
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,830
Senior.

85
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,270
Alright, alright.

86
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,659
Did you get a good look at
that person's appearance?

87
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:04,770
I didn't see clearly.

88
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,690
As soon as I called out,

89
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,750
he ran off without even looking back.

90
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,340
What happened here?

91
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,300
Mr. Dong, a thief broke in here.

92
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,980
We need to quickly
dispatch more people to patrol.

93
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Miss Qin, you're truly thoughtful.

94
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,350
Now that winter has come,

95
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,990
life is inevitably hard for the poor
in the mountains.

96
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,790
We just need to be more vigilant.

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,420
Making such a big fuss,

98
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,150
what if you scare Her Ladyship?

99
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,550
Mr. Dong, I was wrong.

100
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,260
As long as you offer me food,

101
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,030
you can punish me however you want.

102
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,790
Look at you.

103
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,450
Come on.

104
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,370
Get up, get up.

105
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,220
I was wrong.

106
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,310
Alright, alright.

107
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,620
Don't be afraid.

108
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,510
How could I possibly starve you?

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,810
Don't be afraid.

110
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,250
He's also a poor child
taken in by Young Master,

111
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,510
and he was traumatized by hunger before.

112
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,000
It's getting late.

113
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,130
Young Master Sun,

114
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,330
I'd trouble you to escort Miss Qin back.

115
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,250
Mrs. Lin will bring dinner

116
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,740
to everyone's quarters later.

117
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,870
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

118
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,380
You're welcome.

119
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,420
Let's go.

120
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,030
Little Wan'er.

121
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,820
Wan.

122
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,370
Why are you back so late?

123
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,410
Come here. Come on.

124
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,910
-Come here. Sit down.
-What's wrong?

125
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,290
When I woke up today, you weren't here,

126
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,740
so I thought I'd go look for you.

127
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,330
I didn't expect to not find you

128
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,190
but witness quite a show instead.

129
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,370
Where did Little Wan'er go anyway?

130
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,430
Where on earth did she run off to
so early in the morning?

131
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,210
Why couldn't we find her anywhere?

132
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,740
She probably went
to hang out with her senior.

133
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,060
They're senior brother and junior sister,

134
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,720
yet they don't even know
to keep their distance.

135
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,340
Isn't this a plum forest?

136
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,960
Why does it stink so badly?

137
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,540
Look.

138
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,710
What is that?

139
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,020
Let me see.

140
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,410
What's there to look?

141
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,250
What's wrong?

142
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,560
What do you want to see?

143
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,100
What is it?

144
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,030
What are you trying to look at?

145
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,030
It's a wild animal's carcass!

146
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,980
A wild animal's carcass?

147
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,040
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,810
I thought it was night-blooming jasmine.

149
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,840
My Lady, come on.

150
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,740
Why are there so many carcasses
of wild animals here?

151
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,060
Are you alright?

152
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,880
Why didn't you stop me?

153
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,370
You just joined in watching me
make a fool of myself.

154
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,300
What kind of friend

155
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,130
are you?

156
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,100
I'm Bai Feijue.

157
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,770
Sorry for disturbing you ladies.

158
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,970
I'd like to offer my sincere apologies.

159
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,860
Shuang.

160
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,090
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,870
I was almost frightened to death just now.

162
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,950
That's why I lost my composure.

163
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,590
Are you okay?

164
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,690
It's alright.

165
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,740
Later,

166
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,380
I casually mentioned that the Bai family
is a prestigious family in Yizhou,

167
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,420
and Qin Xiang's gaze at Young Master Bai
was so intense

168
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,140
that it seemed like it could drip water.

169
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,970
Where are those animals' carcasses now?

170
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,140
I'd like to take a look.

171
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,040
Why do you want to see those things?

172
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,780
Young Master Bai had his servants
bury them right away.

173
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,300
Ning.

174
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,900
You said those carcasses
were disemboweled,

175
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,340
as if cut open by a blade, right?

176
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,930
Yes.

177
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,350
I would never mistake blade wounds.

178
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,870
My Lady.

179
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,990
Mrs. Lin has brought some pastries.

180
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,570
What kind of pastries?

181
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,050
It's tea shortbread.

182
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,570
I'd like to try some too.

183
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,070
I don't want to go back to that room.

184
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,660
Just seeing her makes me lose my appetite.

185
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,900
My skills are humble.

186
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,160
I hope you ladies won't be disappointed.

187
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,450
This tea shortbread

188
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,210
is even better than what we had
at the tea stall.

189
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,210
Come on, try some.

190
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,500
I'm glad you ladies like it.

191
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,020
Young Master has instructed

192
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,020
that I shall attend to you ladies
for the next few days.

193
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,900
Mrs. Lin, you call Senior "Young Master."

194
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,630
Are you his household servant?

195
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,460
Yes.

196
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,210
Among all the people here, only Dong and I

197
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,780
came here with Young Master.

198
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,020
The others were all cured by Young Master

199
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,750
and chose to stay voluntarily.

200
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,420
Mrs. Lin, your pastries

201
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,450
taste even better than those
made by the locals.

202
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,490
That's truly impressive.

203
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,540
Actually, I didn't know
how to make them before, either.

204
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,060
It was after Young Master cured
my heart ailment

205
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,810
that I suddenly became skilled

206
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,090
at kitchen work.

207
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,480
Dr. Sun can even cure heart ailments?

208
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,560
Indeed.

209
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,810
Young Master said I had necrosis
on my heart

210
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,570
and that cutting it out would cure me.

211
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,920
Please take your time to enjoy, ladies.

212
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,110
If you want anything to eat,

213
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,780
just let me know.

214
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,170
Mrs. Lin, let me open the door for you.

215
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,770
Thank you.

216
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,490
Little Wan'er.

217
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,300
Your senior's medical skills

218
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,160
seem to be even better than yours.

219
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,020
Well, he's my eldest senior,

220
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,950
so of course he's the most skilled.

221
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,880
My Lady, Your Highness.

222
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,170
Breakfast is ready.

223
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,450
Okay.

224
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,560
Junior, something terrible has happened!

225
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,970
Song was killed!

226
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,270
Wan.

227
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,460
Where are you going?

228
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,300
Something happened to
one of Senior's servants.

229
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,140
I'm on my way to check on him.

230
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,970
You can't go.

231
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,570
Senior has always treated me nicely,

232
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,780
and now, with such a great matter
happening in his household,

233
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,240
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

234
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,420
This is not Jingzhou.

235
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,490
No one will cover for you here.

236
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,950
If word gets out about
you examining corpses,

237
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,020
what will become of
you sisters' reputation?

238
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,850
If anyone dares
to speak ill of Little Wan'er,

239
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,540
they'll have to answer to my sword first!

240
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,070
Let's go.

241
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,810
But...

242
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:23,940
Wan.

243
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,630
Cousin Yan.

244
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,900
Don't worry.

245
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,760
Wan's skills

246
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,300
are admired even by Lord Yan
and Prefect Huo.

247
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,540
I'm sure her reputation won't be damaged.

248
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,210
Is that so?

249
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,630
Well then, Shuang,

250
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,850
please tell me more about it.

251
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,120
Mr. Dong.

252
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,380
Sorry for troubling you, Young Master.

253
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,520
Please don't tell my senior
about this yet.

254
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,980
Thank you for easing
Young Master's burden.

255
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,210
Song

256
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,630
is over here.

257
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,570
Ning, don't go there.

258
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,730
Fuling, go get my box
and writing materials.

259
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,210
Yes.

260
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,350
I'll go with you. I know martial arts.

261
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,880
Let's go.

262
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,490
Who could have done this to Song?

263
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,060
Send someone to report this
to the authorities first.

264
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,810
But

265
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,570
the county office is over 20 miles from here,

266
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,300
and with heavy snow and slippery roads,

267
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,780
a round trip would take
two days and two nights.

268
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,380
Even so, we still need to report this
to the authorities.

269
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,580
I'll begin the examination here first.

270
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,740
Young Master Sun, this...

271
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,060
Don't worry.

272
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,000
Junior's forensic skills are exceptional.

273
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,640
She won't make any mistake.

274
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,560
Okay.

275
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,110
I'll go make arrangements right away.

276
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,940
Senior.

277
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,500
The first three days after a crime
are crucial for investigation.

278
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,280
We can't just
wait for officials to arrive.

279
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,990
We must examine everything possible.

280
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,960
In case of delays,

281
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,010
at least we can preserve
some earliest evidence.

282
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,610
Alright.

283
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,930
Who discovered Song first?

284
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,730
It was me.

285
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,330
Why were you here

286
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,550
so early in the morning?

287
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,540
I'm responsible for daily cleaning,

288
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,660
and once I recover,
I'll be leaving the mountain.

289
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,730
I'm grateful to Master for saving my life,

290
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,020
so I got up early this morning,

291
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,850
thinking of sweeping the snow
for Master again.

292
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,090
But I didn't expect

293
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,070
to see a stray cat on the way,

294
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,090
so I chased after it.

295
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,420
And that's when I found Song.

296
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,850
Your body is still weak,

297
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
so why would you chase after that cat?

298
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,060
Young Master Bai instructed yesterday

299
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,320
that we must get rid of
all the stray cats,

300
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,890
so they won't frighten
the ladies at night.

301
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,210
You may go now.

302
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,660
But don't wander off these days.

303
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,390
The officers will come
to question you again.

304
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,430
I understand.

305
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,470
Little Wan'er.

306
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,090
Give it to me.

307
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,330
Let me.

308
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,870
Thank you, Senior.

309
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,100
Little Wan'er.

310
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,900
Your cousin Yan seems to be discussing
with the steward

311
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,060
about getting on the road immediately.

312
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,720
Given the current situation,

313
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,990
nobody can leave.

314
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,700
Senior.

315
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,600
Take notes.

316
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,900
Notes of what?

317
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,020
As per usual,

318
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,730
you talk,

319
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,730
I write.

320
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,090
Write down everything I say.

321
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,190
Alright.

322
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,540
Note this.

323
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,210
Initial examination.

324
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:03,940
Victim:

325
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,300
Song.

326
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,570
Approximately 16 years old.

327
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,150
Judging from the color of the bloodstains,

328
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,390
the time of death was around 1-3 AM.

329
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,770
Based on the victim's posture at death,

330
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,050
the killer likely pinned him
against the wall first,

331
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,310
then cut his limbs off.

332
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,410
Judging from the leg wounds,

333
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,140
the killer intended
to sever the arms as well,

334
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,580
but the blade became dull,

335
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,840
so the arms weren't completely severed.

336
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,870
The fatal wound is a stab to the chest.

337
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,220
No weapon was found at the crime scene.

338
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,850
Based on the wound shape,

339
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,060
the weapon

340
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,090
appears to be an iron blade capable of
both cutting and stabbing,

341
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,060
crudely made,

342
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,700
similar to...

343
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,270
A billhook.

344
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,490
Could the killer be

345
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,450
a madman who enjoys torture and murder?

346
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,260
Why would someone harbor

347
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,660
such hatred toward Song?

348
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,970
The motive for this crime
requires further investigation.

349
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,260
Please have your men
seal this area off first

350
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,420
and guard it day and night, Senior.

351
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,810
The body should not be collected until

352
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,350
after official investigation.

353
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,150
Leave it to me.

354
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,570
Song lost both his parents

355
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,660
and was an orphan.

356
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,280
He suffered from heart disease too,

357
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,590
just like me.

358
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Since childhood,

359
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,050
he was pushed around by those relatives,

360
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,540
with no place to call home.

361
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,140
He had such a miserable life.

362
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,570
Later, after Young Master
cured his illness,

363
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,850
he decided to stay.

364
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,490
I was even thinking of
adopting him as my godson.

365
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,250
I'd raise him as a kid,

366
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,810
and he would care for me in my old age.

367
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,070
Who would have thought

368
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,180
he'd be killed by someone?

369
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,280
Mrs. Lin.

370
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,630
Has Song had any conflicts
with anyone recently?

371
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,300
No.

372
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,900
He was always such an obedient kid.

373
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,830
How could he have offended anyone?

374
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,590
Offend anyone...

375
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,920
Ning, check the wall for
any new footprints.

376
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,569
Got it.

377
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,270
The top of the wall is covered with snow.

378
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,390
Little Wan'er.

379
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,829
What would new footprints look like?

380
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,069
Why did it have to snow last night?

381
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,619
Regardless of whether they're old or new,

382
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,150
check if there are any footprints
in the snow.

383
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
There aren't any.

384
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,140
Junior.

385
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,010
Junior.

386
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,450
You suspect it was the thief
from yesterday?

387
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,420
Mrs. Lin said

388
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,480
Song never made enemies with anyone.

389
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,380
But the thief from yesterday

390
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,860
was discovered by Song,

391
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,710
so he had to take precautions.

392
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,450
Song ruined that thief's plans yesterday,

393
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,250
and that's why he did such ruthless things
to Song.

394
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
The motive is the hardest thing
to investigate,

395
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,880
and we don't have enough evidence
to make any conclusions yet.

396
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,580
If it really was that thief,

397
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,290
he should have climbed over the wall

398
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,580
before 5 AM

399
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,510
for the footprints to be completely
covered by snow.

400
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,870
So what should we do now?

401
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,580
Find the murder weapon.

402
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,240
Has the murder weapon been found?

403
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,040
A billhook is indeed missing
from the storage yard.

404
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,150
If the killer took the murder weapon
with them,

405
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,450
there's a high chance they might
commit another crime.

406
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,770
But with the heavy snow,

407
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,090
the mountain roads are difficult
to traverse.

408
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,340
The government officials

409
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,290
won't arrive until tomorrow evening
at the earliest.

410
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,420
For now, we can only rely on ourselves.

411
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,290
We don't have many guards with us,

412
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,530
and if everyone stays
in separate quarters,

413
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,050
we won't be able to protect everyone.

414
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,210
Tell Senior that

415
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,960
if his wife can be moved,

416
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,510
they'd better stay with us.

417
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,450
Okay.

418
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,820
I'll go inform Young Master right away.

419
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,340
Junior.

420
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,620
What about me?

421
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,480
What's my task?

422
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,010
Such heavy snow

423
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,620
can cover up many traces.

424
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,820
There are no guards in the mansion,

425
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,340
so outsiders could've sneaked in,

426
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,210
but we can't rule out the possibility
of an inside job.

427
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,250
Let's split up and question

428
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,690
the servants about their whereabouts
last night.

429
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,930
Anyone whose story doesn't add up

430
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,790
is a suspect.

431
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,240
Brilliant.

432
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
I learned this method from Lord Yan.

433
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,010
You know, Junior,

434
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,620
at this very moment,

435
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,020
I actually miss him a bit.

436
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,150
Ning?

437
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,450
Why are you here?

438
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,910
I'm guarding the gate for you.

439
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,170
I believe I'm better at guarding the gate
than Fuling, right?

440
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,240
What about you?

441
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,740
Have you found anything?

442
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,600
Everything adds up

443
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,510
perfectly.

444
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,290
All testimonies match,

445
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,570
with nothing suspicious at all.

446
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,250
Young Master Sun, Miss Qin.

447
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,820
Young Master said it was inconvenient
for Young Madam to be moved,

448
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,380
and he'd ensure her safety.

449
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,030
I'll go talk to Senior.

450
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,420
What's wrong?

451
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,340
I miss Chi. What about you?

452
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,110
He...

453
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,590
He has his own matters to attend to.

454
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,440
I used to

455
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,900
think

456
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,450
I was very capable,

457
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,490
but I couldn't even tell
if a footprint was new or old.

458
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,160
Am I completely useless?

459
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,440
So that's what you were talking about.

460
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,570
What did you think I was talking about?

461
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,450
Nothing.

462
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,030
The first time I treated a patient,

463
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,850
I also thought I was really good,

464
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,020
but I misdiagnosed even a simple cold.

465
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,410
Even the medical fairy
made mistakes before?

466
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,610
Everyone in this world makes mistakes.

467
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,490
You only make fewer mistakes
with more experience.

468
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,380
The same applies to you.

469
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,840
We're both exceptionally gifted after all.

470
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,100
I like hearing that.

471
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,660
When I mentioned Chi just now,

472
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,660
why did you blush?

473
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,620
I didn't.

474
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,500
It was the cold weather.

475
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,620
If you say so.

476
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,100
Anyway,

477
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,860
I really miss him.

478
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,010
I also...

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,130
Miss him quite a bit.

480
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,590
The Herbal Garden.

481
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,660
Master.

482
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,520
Master!

483
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,950
Are you alright, Master?

484
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,430
I'm okay.

485
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,600
Let me rest for a while.

486
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,340
Wan.

487
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,770
I'm here.

488
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,390
Hurry! Hurry!

489
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,750
Alright.

490
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,580
Leave it to me.

491
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,460
Fortunately we found them in time,

492
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,900
so the frostbite isn't too severe.

493
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,730
They're currently soaking
in medicinal baths,

494
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,140
but they haven't regained
consciousness yet.

495
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,270
Still unconscious?

496
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,410
Lord Yan has been stationed
at the border for years

497
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,100
and knows well how to march through snow.

498
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,010
How could his body
be damaged to this extent?

499
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,970
Who knows?

500
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,900
If it weren't for
his horse's intelligence...

501
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,770
-Be careful.
-It's okay.

502
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,430
They might have frozen to death
at our doorstep.

503
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,180
His Highness must have overexerted himself

504
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,880
and depleted his vital energy.

505
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,220
I'll go prepare a few doses of

506
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,180
Four Gentlemen Decoction for him.

507
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,440
Senior. His Highness has always been

508
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,420
in good health with strong
Qi and blood energy, so it's unsuitable

509
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,280
for him to take nourishing medicines like
Four Gentlemen Decoction.

510
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,050
That's right.

511
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,450
Medication should be tailored
to the individual.

512
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,340
No wonder Master says I'm book-smart
but lack practical wisdom.

513
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,650
They must have had irregular meals
while traveling,

514
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,860
causing cold invasion and Qi stagnation.

515
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,050
Senior, you could prepare some
navel-warming plasters

516
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,730
for external application
to warm the interior and dispel cold,

517
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,210
promoting Qi circulation
and relieving pain.

518
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,410
Yes, that's what I was thinking as well.

519
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,620
I'll go prepare some plasters
for him then.

520
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,940
I'm better than you at this, Junior.

521
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,620
My Lady, the medicine is ready.

522
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,970
Mrs. Lin, please prepare
two bowls of sugared water for me,

523
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,970
not too sweet,

524
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,580
and also boil some rice oil
to have on hand.

525
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,100
Got it.

526
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,650
Senior, why don't you go
attend to General Bai?

527
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,650
Why?

528
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,130
You want to apply the medicine
on him yourself?

529
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,340
Yes.

530
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,500
He's completely naked right now.

531
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,660
Don't you care about your reputation?

532
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,880
A physician should see no difference
between men and women.

533
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,310
If there's no difference,

534
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,750
then you go attend to General Bai,

535
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,810
and I'll handle this one.

536
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,730
Why is that?

537
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,830
He...

538
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,100
I saw how this guy
looked at you last time,

539
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,510
with questionable intentions.

540
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,570
What if he becomes obsessed with you?

541
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,380
Why would a young lord like him
be obsessed with me?

542
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,000
Besides, I've treated his wounds before
when he was undressed.

543
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,640
If he wanted to do anything,
he would have done so already.

544
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,200
But

545
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,420
he...

546
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,010
He's completely naked now!

547
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,800
If you really feel that uneasy, Senior,

548
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,250
I'll go attend to General Bai instead.

549
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:58,970
No, no, no.

550
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,620
That guy's naked too.

551
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,440
Since you've treated him before,

552
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,010
alright then.

553
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,730
This guy is really getting lucky.

554
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,800
Your Highness, you're awake.

555
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,500
Is there anything you need, Your Highness?

556
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,560
I can get it for you.

557
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,420
I...

558
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,180
I'll go check on Bai Feng.

559
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,140
General Bai is out of danger now.

560
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,660
Your Highness should focus on
your recovery.

561
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,870
Miss Qin, where are my clothes?

562
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,960
They were removed.

563
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,720
You were nearly frozen,

564
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,620
so we had to give you a warm bath
before applying medicine.

565
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,690
Who undressed me?

566
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
It was Senior.

567
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,780
And I applied the medicine.

568
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,670
Thanks a lot.

569
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,630
Your Highness, don't worry.

570
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,160
Just two more treatments,
and you'll be fine.

571
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,170
Thank you, Miss Qin.

572
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,940
I'm almost fully recovered.

573
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,010
Perhaps after I get dressed...

574
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,530
I'll be the judge of that.

575
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,320
Lie down now. I'll apply the medicine
for you.

576
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,480
Please don't trouble yourself, Miss Qin.

577
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm completely healed.

578
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,420
I truly am!

579
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,420
Lie down now.

580
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,210
That won't be necessary.

581
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,620
Master! Master!

582
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,700
Miss Qin.

583
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,030
Come on, let me check your wounds.

584
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,290
I'm not wearing pants.

585
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,210
It was my negligence.

586
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,080
Please punish me, Master.

587
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,970
This isn't the time for that.

588
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,560
Get up.

589
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,450
I won't get up until
you punish me, Master.

590
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,730
Who said you could get out of bed?

591
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,420
Go back now.

592
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,680
We can discuss this after you've healed.

593
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,660
Miss Qin.

594
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,100
Master's injuries are more serious
than mine.

595
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,530
In order to catch up with you,

596
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,770
he left his guards behind
and traveled day and night,

597
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,570
-without even having a single warm meal.
-Shut up.

598
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,400
Keep talking.

599
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,290
Later, when he heard you were
at the Herbal Garden, Lady Wan,

600
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,770
he didn't even stop for water

601
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,990
and rushed up the mountain.

602
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,000
We didn't stop to rest until
we reached the yard gate.

603
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
But during that rest,

604
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,730
I fell into a deep sleep,

605
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,810
and that's how I ended up causing
Young Master to fall into danger.

606
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,020
So Your Highness

607
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,000
did all that for me.

608
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,820
Well, I never expected

609
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,120
the central plains to be so cold.

610
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,980
Master, let me check your wounds.

611
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,620
So you're the only one with a mouth, huh?

612
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,730
Spouting nonsense over there.

613
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,660
I had to speak up.

614
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,420
If I didn't tell Lady Wan,

615
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,010
how would she know
how much you did for her?

616
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,810
Your suffering would be in vain.

617
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,750
Get out of here now.

618
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,770
Get out!

619
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,250
I'll go check on Chi.

620
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,660
It's time for General Bai
to take his medicine.

621
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,720
I'll go remind him.

622
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,860
My Lady.

623
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,590
His Highness rushed over here,
risking his life.

624
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,660
-Such devotion...
-But what about the future?

625
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,360
Fuling.

626
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,530
In what capacity should I
accept this kindness,

627
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,090
Qin Wan or Shen Wan?

628
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,380
If my father's wrongful conviction
cannot be cleared,

629
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,140
how am I supposed to stay by his side?

630
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,520
Am I supposed to live out my life

631
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,650
as Qin Wan?

632
00:32:59,380 --> 00:32:59,900
My Lady...

633
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,490
Fuling.

634
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,940
There's no need to say anything more.

635
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,400
My mind is a mess right now.

636
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,180
Lady Wan, the officials have arrived.

637
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,110
Mr. Dong is taking them to see Song.

638
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,870
Let's go.

639
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,320
Butler Dong.

640
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,730
Isn't your Dr. Sun's medical skill

641
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,580
supposedly able
to bring the dead back to life?

642
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,080
How come

643
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,780
he failed to save him?

644
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,180
Constable Song, you jest.

645
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,170
When we got here,

646
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,820
the young man was already dead.

647
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,970
That's why I say,

648
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,900
and this proves,

649
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,340
that even the greatest physicians

650
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,100
need help from us sometimes.

651
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,250
Too bad Dr. Sun doesn't have

652
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,340
any respect for minor officials like us.

653
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,620
That's not a very fair thing to say, Sir.

654
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,530
Alright, alright.

655
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,530
Examine the body.

656
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,710
But don't overdo it.

657
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,660
This Herbal Garden is isolated
from everywhere.

658
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,530
It's likely one of their own people
did it.

659
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,460
Constable Song.

660
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,860
I've already made inquiries.

661
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,460
No one at the Herbal Garden had any grudge
against this young man.

662
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,090
Lady Wan, please don't go over there.

663
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,770
The officials are examining the body.

664
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,490
Okay.

665
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,010
Chief, we've finished the examination.

666
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,730
The victim died from stab wounds
to the chest and abdomen.

667
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,790
His clothes are relatively intact,

668
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,530
suggesting he didn't struggle much
before being killed.

669
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,820
The killer was likely someone he knew.

670
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:25,550
Look.

671
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,010
Didn't I say so?

672
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,699
It was someone he knew who did it.

673
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,260
Take everyone from the garden
back to yamen

674
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,170
and interrogate them one by one.

675
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,350
Under torture, there's no way
they won't confess.

676
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,469
As a constable,

677
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,030
is this how you investigate cases?

678
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,949
Who are you?

679
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,790
A young lady should be embroidering
in her room,

680
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,739
not meddling in affairs here, alright?

681
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,389
I'm here investigating the case
on behalf of yamen.

682
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,159
Go away.

683
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,290
You're in no position to speak here.

684
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,090
To judge it as being committed by
an acquaintance based solely on

685
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,860
whether the clothes are disheveled—

686
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,750
With such a crude investigation, how
are you worthy of being called officials?

687
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,380
Insulting officials, huh?

688
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:53,739
I...

689
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,420
I dare you!

690
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,170
I do dare!

691
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,739
This is Miss Qin Wan from the Qin family.

692
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:01,219
The Qin family?

693
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,290
That's what I thought.

694
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,840
No wonder Miss Qin has such presence.

695
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,900
However, since Miss Qin is
a sheltered lady,

696
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,820
she surely knows nothing
about criminal law.

697
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,950
If Miss Qin Wan knows nothing about it,

698
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,590
then perhaps no one in this world
would dare claim they do.

699
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,610
Who is this?

700
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,170
Where's the token I gave you?

701
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,140
Why didn't you use it?

702
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
It slipped my mind

703
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,320
for a moment.

704
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,320
Take it out and try it now.

705
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,480
[Yan]

706
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,290
Heir of Prince Rui's token?

707
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,380
It was my fault for being blind!

708
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,130
I beg your forgiveness, My Lord!

709
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,900
What "Lord"?

710
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,740
This is

711
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,860
the Heir of Prince Rui himself.

712
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,120
Saying you were blind?

713
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,670
I think you simply never had eyes
to begin with!

714
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,230
Yes.

715
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,500
Miss Qin Wan has profound knowledge
in criminal law.

716
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,940
She's a strategist I specifically hired.

717
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,600
To receive her guidance today

718
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,370
is your great fortune.

719
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,110
You may rise.

720
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,610
It was all my fault for being so ignorant.

721
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,970
Please forgive me, Miss Qin.

722
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,090
Miss Qin has a heart full of loyalty
to His Majesty and love for the people.

723
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,170
It's because of this that
she disregarded the criticism

724
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,200
and assisted me in inspecting
the criminal cases of various states.

725
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,300
You should respectfully address her as

726
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,260
"Master Wan."

727
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,560
Yes.

728
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,720
Please allow us

729
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,960
to pay our respects to you, Master Wan.

730
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
Respects to you, Master Wan.

731
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,400
Please, no need for formalities.

732
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,950
Fuling.

733
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,770
The box.

734
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:42,860
Yes.

735
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,910
Senior.

736
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Please escort His Highness and General Bai

737
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,320
back to rest first.

738
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,100
No need.

739
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,090
Bai Feng and I will go examine
the crime scene.

740
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,740
We'll let you know if we find anything.

741
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,800
But your wounds...

742
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,860
I'll apply more medicine for him.

743
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,340
As long as it's properly treated,

744
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,270
he should be able

745
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,140
to survive.

746
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,810
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet,

747
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,210
and the killer might commit another crime.

748
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,340
This inspection must uncover the reason

749
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,130
why the victim appeared
in the storage yard at midnight.

750
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,900
Right. Right.

751
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
Did you hear that?

752
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,970
Master Wan.

753
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,010
We've finished cleaning.

754
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,300
Okay.

755
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,450
Step back then.

756
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,220
Note this.

757
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,870
Quickly, write it down.

758
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,420
Yes.

759
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,990
Abrasion on the left cheek.

760
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Fell backward on right shoulder,
showing abrasions.

761
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,840
Bruising and stab wounds
on the chest and abdomen.

762
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,610
Knees

763
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,900
and front of lower legs show
bruising and abrasions.

764
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,130
Cut wounds on both palms.

765
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,060
Blood stain on the right wrist.

766
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,540
Where are the victim's clothes?

767
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,200
Here, here.

768
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,480
Mr. Dong.

769
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,860
Do the servants at Herbal Garden

770
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,990
have winter clothes of this material?

771
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,130
No.

772
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,340
Young Master has always treated
us servants well

773
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,740
and would never use such coarse cotton
to make clothes for us.

774
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,670
This...

775
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,630
Where are the victim's shoes?

776
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,220
Shoes!

777
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,490
Master Wan.

778
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,230
The victim's shoes were completely
soaked in blood,

779
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,430
yet the soles are dry.

780
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,700
Dry?

781
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,880
Master.

782
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,570
This is Song's room.

783
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,240
Master.

784
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,010
Is there a latrine to the front left?

785
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,860
There's a servants' latrine not far ahead.

786
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,450
Let's go

787
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,860
and find the spot where the victim
encountered the killer.

788
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
This way, Master.

789
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,380
Master.

790
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,680
Where does this corridor lead to?

791
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,280
It's not marked on Mr. Dong's map.

792
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,180
I'll go check.

793
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,610
Take it slow.

794
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,860
We're in no hurry.

795
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,060
Don't worry, Master.

796
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,570
Your Highness, Miss Qin has finished
examining the body,

797
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,630
and I've specially come to guide you.

798
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,870
Your Highness.

799
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,650
I'm here to deliver the postmortem report

800
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,210
on Master Wan's orders.

801
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,380
Is anyone protecting Master Wan
over there?

802
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,050
Yes, there is.

803
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,050
I've arranged it.

804
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,220
With me here,

805
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
Master Wan won't even get a scratch.

806
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,050
The soles are dry?

807
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,080
Master.

808
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:57,650
Master.

809
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,860
Up ahead the corridor is a pharmacy.

810
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,650
Although the door is locked,

811
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,780
there's a strong medicinal smell.

812
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,640
Further ahead,

813
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,780
there are several forking paths.

814
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,130
The pharmacy is indeed down the corridor,

815
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,990
and further ahead is Young Master's
Renxin Clinic.

816
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,540
Killed on a snowy night,

817
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,870
yet the soles are dry.

818
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,420
This indicates that everywhere
the victim went was either corridors

819
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,360
or places with some form of cover.

820
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,950
The map.

821
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,000
In the cold of midnight,

822
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,940
the victim may have gone out
to use the bathroom,

823
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,670
passing through the corridor.

824
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,130
However, upon reaching this spot,
he encountered the murderer.

825
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,800
Seeing the murderer's suspicious behavior,

826
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,730
he followed him.

827
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,720
Realizing he was being tailed,

828
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,070
the murderer deliberately led him
to a secluded area.

829
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,780
Until...

830
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,190
Isn't that exactly
where the victim was killed?

831
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,680
On our way here,

832
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,420
besides the corridor,

833
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,170
there was only that covered walkway.

834
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,360
The eaves above the walkway are connected,

835
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,020
perfectly blocking the snow,

836
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,700
which explains why
the victim's soles are dry.

837
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,400
As for the murder weapon
Master Wan identified,

838
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,740
it should be something like a billhook.

839
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,600
Your Highness.

840
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,230
This is the storage yard,

841
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,780
which is usually never locked.

842
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,610
After Song sharpened the billhooks,

843
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,570
he'd store them by the yard entrance.

844
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,570
That makes sense.

845
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,740
The killer must have entered
the storage yard first,

846
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,640
grabbed a billhook, and waited
for the victim to follow.

847
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,360
But if the killer acted on impulse,

848
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,940
why was the attack so brutal?

849
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,420
Perhaps the killer didn't act on impulse.

850
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,570
It's possible that the person
he intended to kill

851
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,630
wasn't the victim.

852
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,970
[Benevolent Heart]

853
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,150
Your Highness.

854
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,530
Are you suggesting that

855
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,730
the killer's target was Renxin Clinic?

856
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,860
That the one they wanted to kill
was our Young Master?

857
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,320
It's just my speculation.

858
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,170
The victim's unexpected intervention

859
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,780
disrupted the killer's plan,

860
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,860
resulting in his brutal murder.

861
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,900
That's impossible.

862
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,700
Our Young Master is dedicated
to saving lives and healing people,

863
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,700
providing free medicine and treatment
to the locals.

864
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,780
It's impossible that anyone would

865
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,090
harbor murderous intentions toward him.

866
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,550
Until we catch the killer,

867
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,000
we must consider all possibilities.

868
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,610
But no matter what,

869
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,220
the victim was just a young man.

870
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,100
In the dead of night, seeing someone
acting suspiciously,

871
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
why would he dare to approach alone?

872
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,530
Song was kind-hearted and sincere.

873
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,020
He had long seen Young Master
as his savior.

874
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,170
If he had discovered that
the killer's target

875
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,530
was Renxin Clinic,

876
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,060
no matter how scared he was,

877
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,790
he would still have followed them.

878
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,320
If my concerns are correct,

879
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,400
our top priority now is
to protect Young Master Sun.

880
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,420
My Black Armor Guards won't arrive
for another few hours.

881
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,350
Constable Song.

882
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,750
I'll leave the safety of Renxin Clinic
in your hands for now.

883
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,350
At Your Highness's command.

884
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,340
Go now.

885
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,900
To Renxin Clinic.
