Why did I grab his collar and kiss him?

How did I let her grab my collar
and kiss me?

5
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,039
I was the one taking the initiative?

6
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,980
I should have been the one
taking the initiative.

7

No.

9
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,030
I have to say

10

Where is the General?

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,310
She went to the camp early this morning

16

and didn't even have time for breakfast.

Is there something urgent?

18

I didn't hear about anything urgent.

Put the large ones there.

21

Isn't this the fine wine the General

22

Where's it being moved?

The General said

25
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
drinking causes trouble.

26
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,300
Drinking causes trouble?

What does that mean?

28
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,190
Let me tell you,

29
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,960
from now on, you should stop asking

30

Trouble?

33
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,380
Come on. How does it cause trouble?

34
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,240
What kind of trouble did it cause?

35
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,400
She's been drinking for years,

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,130
and now she just suddenly quit.

37
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,880
She must be feeling extremely regretful.

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,030
What?

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,560
Does she really regret it?

40
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
How would I know?

41
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,590
You rushed here in the morning

42
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,190
without saying anything clearly,

43
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,990
repeating only a few sentences.

44
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,360
If an ordinary person
could understand you,

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
it'd be a miracle.

46

Forget it.

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
That's for ordinary people.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not ordinary.

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
It was simply

50
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,220
that the mood was just right.

51
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,080
You followed your feelings,

52
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,500
forgot about propriety,

53
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,240
and in a moment of impulse,

54
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,840
you did something you now deeply regret.

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,160
It was not in a moment of impulse,

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,360
and I do not regret it.

57
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,839
I am serious about her.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
You two are truly a carefree couple,

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,340
meant to enjoy love in this world.

60

This is what Shuang deserves.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,270
Besides, from the way

62
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,120
she looked at you yesterday,

63
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,400
I already understood something.

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,310
Since that's the case,

65
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,190

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,570
my approval to be together.

67

From now on,

68

I'm practically your mother-in-law.

69

You must take care of her

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,650
and show me utmost respect.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,610
If you want to be a mother,
just have a child yourself.

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,580
Since you say you understand Shuang,

73
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,730
can you tell me

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,530
why she's avoiding me today?

75
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,430
Perhaps...

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,530
she still has some dissatisfaction
with you.

77
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,880
What dissatisfaction?

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,390
She's a general,

For a lifelong commitment,

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,990
there should be some sense of ceremony.

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,750
you're always the first
to rush to their aid.

176
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,910
Can you honestly say

177
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
your trip to Lucheng this time

178
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,120
is not to meet your former lover?

179
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,640
This is Father's decree.

180
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,570
I don't care.

181
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,940
Listen carefully:

182
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,710
I

183
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,150
am the Prime Minister's daughter

184
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,840
and your rightful Crown Princess.

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,150
Since you are my husband,

186
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,480
there must be no one else in your eyes.

187
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,000
So you mean

188
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,120
I should defy the imperial order?

189
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,600
I...

190
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,940
Alright.

191
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,820
This journey is long and arduous.

192
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,480
If I can avoid it,

193
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,230
I naturally have no objection.

194
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,360
But if it

195
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,080
angers His Majesty,

196
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,110
my father-in-law's painstaking efforts

197
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,340
may go to waste.

198
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,270
I wonder, in his eyes,

199
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,540
which is more important:

200
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,920
you or the honor of the Ji family?

201
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,250
You're using my father to pressure me?

202
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,320
How could I?

203
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,780
Crown Princess,
you are the only daughter in your family.

204
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,560
Even if His Majesty punishes us,

205
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
my father-in-law

206
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,160
will surely take your side.

207
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,170
Huai'en!

208
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,830
Yes.

209
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,590
Escort the Crown Princess back.

210
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
Your Highness, I've already investigated

211
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,490
the matter you instructed.

212
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,490
Not only did His Majesty go to
Wuling Mountain

213
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,200
to obtain the longevity elixir,

214
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,720
but he also
specifically had the Imperial Astrologer

215
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,400
calculate the birth charts
of the Crown Prince

216
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,060
and Prime Minister Ji's daughter,
Ji Tianjiao.

217
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,390
I believe

218
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,130
His Majesty arranged
their marriage so that,

219
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,990
when the "Mars retrograding near Antares"
occurs,

220
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,790
the Crown Prince, as the heir,

221
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,670
would have a perfect fate

222
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,080
to shield His Majesty from disaster.

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,030
Ji Lan thinks

224
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,840
he's holding a winning piece,

225
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,200
not knowing that

226
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,200
his precious daughter

227
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,670
will soon become a widow.

228
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,180
Your Highness,

229
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,870
are we really going to

230
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,790
let the Li family

231
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,550
turn the tables so easily?

232
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,270
Li Shuang's defeat of the Yao Army

233
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,000
was a tremendous achievement,

234
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,610
which has changed Father's mind.

235
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,720
At present,

236
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,740
even Li Wei has been reinstated
to his position.

237
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,980
Who would dare say anything more?

238
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,290
Li Wei

239
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,530
is a veteran minister of many reigns,

240
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,440
and Li Shuang commands the Changfeng Army.

241
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,020
If the Crown Prince intends
to ally with the Li family,

242
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,770
he cannot be underestimated.

243
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm well aware of that.

244
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,390
I doubt Su Muyang

245
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,240
will make it safely to Lucheng.

246
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,220
Your Highness, your foresight

247
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,860
is beyond my reach.

248
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,810
[Prime Minister's Mansion]

249
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,360
Your Highness!

250
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,510
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

251
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,600
It won't do your health any good.

252
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,200
Get out!

253
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,270
Forgive me, My Lord.

254
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,320
You coward!

255
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
How dare you go to see her!

256
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,150
What's the matter this time?

257
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,280
Is it because of
the Crown Prince's mission to Lucheng?

258
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,490
Are you reluctant to part with him?

259
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,690
Not at all!

260
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,150
Everyone knows

261
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,720
he has a special relationship
with Li Shuang.

262
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,190
Meeting his former lover openly

263
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,880
shows he has no respect for me!

264
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,840
As the Crown Princess,

265
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,630
I'll become a laughingstock!

266
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,480
What laughingstock?

267
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,600
Why are you being so shortsighted?

268
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,300
I'm your own daughter.

269
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Why are you siding with an outsider?

270
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,590
My daughter,

271
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,550
now,

272
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,930
Prince Li has grown powerful,

273
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,320
with nearly half the court officials
supporting him.

274
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,240
Li Zhangyi's misconduct

275
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,360
shouldn't have been a big deal,

276
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,870
but His Majesty
not only punished him severely,

277
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,120
he also sent the Crown Prince to Lucheng
to supply the army.

278
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,650
Do you know what that means?

279
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,510
In a royal family, the Emperor
is first a ruler, and only then a father.

280
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,510
Prince Li's power is too great,

281
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,440
and that's not good

282
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,870
for His Majesty.

283
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,080
Are you saying

284
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,340
His Majesty intends to promote Su Muyang

285
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,290
to counterbalance Prince Li?

286
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,670
Even though the Li family's crisis
has eased,

287
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,960
they're far less favored

288
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,490
by His Majesty than before.

289
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,420
If Su Muyang goes there

290
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,960
and gets involved with them,

291
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,790
won't your plans…

292
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,910
To achieve greatness,

293
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,060
one cannot fuss over
short-term gains or losses.

294
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,520
Li Wei fell under His Majesty's suspicion

295
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,550
because he held military power.

296
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,430
If General Li stands with us,

297
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,720
the Crown Prince may one day
have a shot at the throne.

298
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,670
But he and Li Shuang...

299
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,510
The Crown Prince is not someone
who can't read the situation.

300
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,550
Besides,

301
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,240
he's weak by nature.

302
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,810
As long as you secure
your position as Empress,

303
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,290
who he surrounds himself with

304
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,450
won't matter.

305
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,770
You should treat him better in the future.

306
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,480
After all, you are husband and wife.

307
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,540
You need to act like a Crown Princess.

308
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,600
Others aside,

309
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,080
women who are already married

310
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,670
shouldn't go back to their parental home

311
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,790
all the time.

312
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,069
Father,

313
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,069
I just missed you.

314
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,400
Besides,

315
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,310
I'm in charge
at the Crown Prince's Mansion.

316
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,510
No one would dare stop me
if I want to leave.

317
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,240
Don't you want me

318
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,160
by your side all the time?

319
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,079
Oh, you.

320
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,240
The illness came on suddenly.

321
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,680
We've already sent someone
to inform the General.

322
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,310
But we didn't dare
make decisions on our own,

323
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,370
so we had to ask you to come take a look.

324
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,580
He's having an epileptic seizure.

325
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,680
Go to my clinic and find Nanxing.

326
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,070
He knows the prescription.

327
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,220
Once the medicine is ready,
bring it to me.

328
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,830
My Lady,

329
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,310
he's just a prisoner condemned to die.

330
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,960
Do we really need
to go to such lengths to treat him?

331
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,720
It's her?

332
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,350
Even if he's condemned to die,

333
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,640
he hasn't been executed yet.

334
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,170
He can die after he's cured.

335
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,440
Do as Miss Lu says.

336
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,720
Hurry and get the medicine.

337
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,240
Yes.

338
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,820
He's awake.

339
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,640
He's awake!

340
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,300
He's awake.

341
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,070
Miss Lu, you truly excel in medicine.

342
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,400
Take good care of him these next few days

343
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,880
and remember to give him
his medicine on time.

344
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,510
If anything unusual happens,

345
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,570
notify me immediately, understood?

346
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,230
Thank you for your help, Miss.

347
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,750
This way.

348
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,680
You bold villain!

349
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,480
Let go of Miss Lu!

350
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,160
Don't move!

351
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,690
If you don't want her to die,

352
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,030
have someone prepare a fast horse for me!

353
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,680
Hurry!

354
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,920
If it weren't for this kind young lady,

355
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,640
who didn't mind your filth and stink

356
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,770
and still saved you,

357
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,750
you'd be in hell by now.

358
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,850
And you?

359
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,400
Not only did you repay kindness
with enmity,

360
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,960
you dirtied her hands.

361
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,440
Mind your own business!

362
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,750
Not many people

363
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,880
can make it out of this prison alive.

364
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
Worry about yourself first!

365
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,560
Please calm down.

366
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,280
The General isn't here.

367
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,790
I have no authority to negotiate with you.

368
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,550
How about this?

369
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,590
Release Miss Lu

370
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,310
and take me instead.

371
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,030
Don't move!

372
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,970
Do you think I'm stupid?

373
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,350
You're just a soldier.

374
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,610
No one cares if you die.

375
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,070
But she's different.

376
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,180
She's an army physician,

377
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,580
worth much more than you.

378
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,960
I don't appreciate what you just said.

379
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,000
Soldiers, army physicians,

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
rabbits, wild boars,

381
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,070
even this little cricket—

382
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,030
they're all lives.

383
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,880
What gives anyone the right
to rank their worth?

384
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,750
Who said that? I'm very valuable.

385
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,400
Shut up!

386
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,070
Don't think I wouldn't dare kill you.

387
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,200
Even if you kill me, you won't get away!

388
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,460
Just taking someone with me before I die—

389
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,680
one is no loss,

390
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,960
and two is profit!

391
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,160
I'm asking you for the last time.

392
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,550
Don't!

393
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,550
Do you agree?

394
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,160
Fine.

395
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Then I'll kill her first!

396
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,200
Taking a hostage

397
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,920
and trying to escape.

398
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,720
Lu Xin.

399
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,890
Are you alright?

400
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,920
Are you hurt?

401
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm fine.

402
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,830
Just twisted my neck.

403
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,670
Let me see.

404
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,600
It hurts.

405
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,400
Miss, you acted decisively.

406
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Truly worthy of a general's talent.

407
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Fortunately he stepped in just now,

408
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,880
or I'd be dead.

409
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,120
Thank you for saving me.

410
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,830
You've been here for 4 or 5 days already.

411
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,890
Do you plan to stay in prison forever?

412
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,790
I could stay a few more days,

413
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,310
but

414
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,030
this cell is too dark—

415
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,960
I can't get used to it.

416
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,690
So I won't trouble you further.

417
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,170
Here's my official document.

418
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Since you have it,

419
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,480
why didn't you show it earlier?

420
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,350
If I had,
how could I have had such an experience?

421
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,270
May I leave now?

422
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,090
Thank you for today.

423
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,550
If you ever cause any trouble in the city,

424
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,880
I will show no mercy.

425
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,590
Also,

426
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,720
your hairpin...

427
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,890
I can't let those prison meals go unpaid.

428
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,930
My name is Mo Yin.

429
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,480
I believe we'll meet again.

430
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,650
Wrong way.

431
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
It hurts.

432
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
It took all my effort to save his life.

433
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,400
When you...

434
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,830
raised your sword,

435
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,590
you didn't hesitate at all.

436
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,160
And you have the nerve to say that?

437
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,810
If you hadn't been lucky enough today

438
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,940
to be saved by Mo Yin,

439
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,570
would you even be alive to speak here?

440
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,400
I'm a doctor.

441
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,670
Healing the sick
and saving lives is my duty,

442
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,020
just as it's your duty

443
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,070
as a general to protect the people.

444
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,630
Let me ask you,

445
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,110
over these years

446
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,510
of practicing medicine,

447
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,190
how much dowry have you saved?

448
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,940
If it's not enough,
I'll make up the difference myself.

449
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,120
I don't plan to get married.

450
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,340
Why do I need a dowry?

451
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,570
I've thought about it.

452
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,960
Since you like Ji Ran,

453
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,440
I'll arrange your marriage to him.

454
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,550
With him protecting you by your side,

455
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,480
I can rest easy.

456
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,070
Can you stop this habit

457
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,720
of playing matchmaker?

458
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,760
Ji Ran doesn't want to marry me,

459
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,650
and I don't want to marry him.

460
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,590
But didn't you…

461
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,440
Yes.

462
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,440
I did have feelings

463
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,920
for him before,

464
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,690
but that's over now.

465
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,750
There's nothing romantic between us.

466
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,750
Then you can

467
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,400
cultivate some.

468
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,240
Besides,

469
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,030
we can see how it goes
after you get married.

470
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,200
I make my own decisions about marriage.

471
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,110
Why should I listen to you?

472
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,960
He's your subordinate,

473
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,750
with his life constantly at risk,

474
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,830
always ready to die on the battlefield.

475
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,750
Are you asking him to protect me

476
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,070
or to make me a widow?

477
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,940
I heard that

478
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,510
someone got drunk

479
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,300
and got herself into trouble.

480
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,350
My past with Ji Ran is over.

481
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,590
Don't bring it up again!

482
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,720
I know you worry about me.

483
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,160
Even though
I often complain about being alone,

484
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,400
I've never truly felt lonely—

485
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,640
because I have you.

486
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,430
But you,

487
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,480
now that you've found someone
who truly cares for you,

488
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,810
you should cherish him.

489
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,400
Alright.

490
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,070
From now on,

491
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,790
I'll respect every decision you make.

492
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,790
However,

493
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,770
starting tomorrow,

494
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,550
you will come to my residence

495
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,680
every day at 7 AM

496
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,400
and train with the maids.

497
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,510
On the one hand,

498
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,020
it will strengthen your body,

499
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,920
on the other hand,
you'll learn to protect yourself.

500
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,520
It's all benefit and no harm.

501
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,880
I usually sleep in
until late morning every day.

502
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,090
Then this method
doesn't seem suitable for you.

503
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,550
Let's arrange your marriage instead.

504
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,420
Guards!

505
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,190
No, no, don't come!

506
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,260
I know there are many people here.

507
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,540
I'll train.

508
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,690
If you don't show up,

509
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,420
I'll personally come to your clinic
to fetch you.

510
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,910
General,

511
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,440
there's a letter from the capital.

512
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,000
Military Advisor Qin

513
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,930
wants to see you.

514
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,960
Someone's here.

515
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:17,990
His Majesty

516
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,310
ordered the Crown Prince
to Lucheng to reward the troops.

517
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,180
He'll

518
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,270
be departing soon.

519
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,110
I suppose the court,

520
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,720
to prevent complaints
among the frontline soldiers

521
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,160
over Li Zhangyi's dereliction of duty,

522
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,160
sent the Crown Prince specifically

523
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,640
to boost morale.

524
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,050
One moment they're cautious of us,

525
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,140
the next they're appeasing us.

526
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,850
They always think they know what's best.

527
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,890
These people spend all day
overthinking things

528
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,640
and then send waves of people to us.

529
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,870
I think

530
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,950
they're just too idle in the capital.

531
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,750
You shouldn't talk nonsense.

532
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,060
If someone hears it and reports you,

533
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,790
it could be considered
a capital offense for disrespect.

534
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,400
Before I die, I'll expose

535
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,660
your secret drinking.

536
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,920
Enough.

537
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,240
It's a long journey.

538
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,290
His Highness is precious.

539
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,880
Let's just make proper arrangements
when he's here.

540
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,440
Yes.

541
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,450
General,

542
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,210
do you think the court

543
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,950
specifically sent the Crown Prince here

544
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,500
because of that man in black?

545
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,030
I think it's very likely.

546
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,680
That man in black is truly mysterious.

547
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,480
Although he helps us every time,

548
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,440
he comes and goes without a trace,

549
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,110
like a ghost.

550
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,070
That's enough.

551
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,110
Don't

552
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,840
speculate about His Majesty's intentions.

553
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,440
Also,

554
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,910
no matter who the man in black is,

555
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,970
he has repeatedly helped us greatly.

556
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,270
The Changfeng Army owes him a great debt.

557
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,920
Luo Teng,

558
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,200
pass my order:

559
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,550
no one in the army

560
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,720
is allowed to speak about him recklessly;

561
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,400
violators

562
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,550
will face military punishment.

563
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,160
Yes.

564
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,080
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

565
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,720
Muyang!

566
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,880
Ting?

567
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,160
What brings you here?

568
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,160
I heard you're going to Lucheng.

569
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I have some things

570
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,510
I want you to deliver to Shuang.

571
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,560
You could have had someone

572
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,920
bring them over.

573
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,240
Why did you come in person?

574
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,720
I haven't seen you for a while.

575
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,850
I came to see you off.

576
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,820
The journey to Lucheng
is long and difficult,

577
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,350
and your health isn't good.

578
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
Did you pack everything?

579
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,660
Don't worry.

580
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,310
I used to deliver things for you.

581
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,830
This time it's the other way around.

582
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,740
Shuang will be

583
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,960
very happy to see you.

584
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,000
Crown Prince, why didn't you

585
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
tell me that you're leaving?

586
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,160
I prepared some gifts.

587
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,070
Though they're things I don't need,

588
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,030
they should be

589
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,400
exquisite items General Li hasn't seen.

590
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,180
Please take them to her for me as well,

591
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,900
as a token of my regard.

592
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,680
Shuang has always been frugal

593
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,130
and spent much time in the army.

594
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,530
She probably won't need such fancy things.

595
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,290
Your Highness,
you don't need to trouble yourself.

596
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,890
Though General Li is a woman,

597
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,440
she is brave and skilled in battle,

598
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,630
with remarkable military achievements.

599
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,020
She's truly admirable,

600
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,700
far better than some men.

601
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,970
Shuang said that as long as

602
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,740
one has righteousness in their heart,

603
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,340
men can manage the household

604
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,350
and women can fight on the battlefield.

605
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,850
As the old saying goes,
all beings are equal.

606
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,580
So why be bound by conventions?

607
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
I don't want to waste my time
arguing with you.

608
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,350
Since this is a royal reward,

609
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,850
whether your sister likes it or not,

610
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,100
she has to accept it.

611
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,460
That's the way between ruler and subject.

612
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,270
The journey is long and difficult.

613
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,730
Crown Prince,
please take care of yourself.

614
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,420
She has quite a temper.

615
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,010
She's always like this.

616
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,320
Don't take it personally.

617
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,980
I wouldn't stoop to her level.

618
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,280
But you, Muyang,

619
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,440
please don't take it to heart.

620
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,990
Ting,

621
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,270
you've grown up.

622
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,690
You speak and act with more restraint now.

623
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,860
Shuang said that

624
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm an adult now

625
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,690
and shouldn't act recklessly.

626
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,350
Shuang,

627
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,070
I hope this time

628
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,720
you can understand your own feelings.

629
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,350
I know you've always had Shuang
in your heart,

630
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,440
but she…

631
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,880
Anyway,

632
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,010
you must treat her well,

633
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,310
especially well.

634
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,440
Don't ever let anyone surpass you.

635
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,360
That's her!

636
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:36,920
Let's go!

637
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,270
Everyone knows you're a bastard
General Li brought back,

638
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,790
with no parents.

639
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,240
-Little bastard!
-Little bastard!

640
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,300
What are you doing?

641
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,400
The little cripple
is protecting the little bastard—

642
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,960
you two really suit each other.

643
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,750
Insult me alone

644
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,070
if you want.

645
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,400
Dragging others into it

646
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,350
is your fault!

647
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,590
I'll insult anyone I want to!

648
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,110
Little bastard! Little cripple!

649
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,310
Beat him!

650
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,110
Beat him!

651
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,160
Beat him!

652
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,440
Stand up.

653
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,970
You're a prince.

654
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,220
You must always stand tall

655
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,640
to avoid being bullied.

656
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,420
I didn't know you were so skilled,

657
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,440
unlike me...

658
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,270
Even if you don't cause trouble,

659
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,470
you need to be able to protect yourself.

660
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,780
If you're willing,

661
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,110
starting tomorrow,

662
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,500
you can practice swordsmanship with me.

663
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,230
But my right hand...

664
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,950
If you want, starting tomorrow,
you can train swordsmanship with me.

665
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,110
If you can't wield the sword
with your right hand,

666
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,170
then use your left.

667
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,740
My father once said

668
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,920
that with determination,

669
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,180
anything is possible.

670
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,270
You don't need to call me
"Your Highness" anymore.

671
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,270
We're friends.

672
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,400
Just call me Muyang from now on.

673
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,150
Your Highness,

674
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,310
since you're here to reward the troops,

675
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,710
you should focus on that.

676
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,470
Prince Li has many eyes and ears.

677
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,710
If he finds out,

678
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,440
he might make things difficult
for you again.

679
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,500
I've always avoided confronting him

680
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,920
to show that I have no desire

681
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,270
to compete with him

682
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,170
and only want to live in peace.

683
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,720
How else will he target me?

684
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,640
After all,

685
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,910
General Li holds command
over the Changfeng Army.

686
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,220
I don't care about military power at all.

687
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,680
Father has never trusted me
with important matters.

688
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,610
The reason he sent me here this time

689
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,700
must be that he has tacitly approved

690
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,740
Shuang and me being together.

691
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Now,

692
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,600
I can rightfully
place this hairpin on her.

693
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,680
Because of this,

694
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,040
you must have suffered quite a bit, right?

695
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,510
I don't remember.

696
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,150
In that case,

697
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,570
losing my memory wasn't so bad.

698
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,659
-Actually, I'm here today to tell you...
-The Crown Prince is coming.

699
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,929
The news about the man in black
has reached the capital.

700
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,150
The purpose of the Crown Prince's visit
isn't clear yet.

701
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,030
But I can't

702
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,690
shake this feeling of unease.

703
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,600
The court has always been full
of power struggles,

704
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,550
and you possess extraordinary abilities.

705
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,510
I'm afraid

706
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,020
they might think that whoever has you

707
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,080
can rule the world.

708
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,429
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

709
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,280
I am.

710
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,420
Whether I turn into the man in black

711
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,650
depends on my mood.

712
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,739
They won't catch me so easily.

713
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,030
But you—

714
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,090
when the Crown Prince arrives,

715
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,190
how will you introduce me?

716
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,370
Then how do you want me to introduce you?

717
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,500
My servant?

718
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,070
My boytoy?

719
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,670
Or...

720
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,110
my husband-to-be?

721
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,680
Why are you so blunt?

722
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,440
You're a woman after all.

723
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,320
So what?

724
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,670
I've never cared for the shackles

725
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,840
this world places on women.

726
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,440
Men can lead troops into battle—

727
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,320
so can women.

728
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,550
Men can joke freely—

729
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,660
why can't I?

730
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,400
That's true.

731
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,590
So,

732
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,360
how exactly do you plan to introduce me?

733
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,520
Since you're asking,

734
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,830
you must have thought of a way, right?

735
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,670
Before, I taught you qin, chess,
calligraphy, and painting,

736
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,630
and you said they were useless.

737
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,660
Now I'm teaching you etiquette.

738
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,190
Surely that will be useful.

739
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,190
One day,

740
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,190
when you go to the capital
to meet His Majesty,

741
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,070
you won't be at a loss.

742
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
That makes sense.

743
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,200
Are you willing to teach me?

744
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,760
Of course I'm willing to teach you.

745
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,670
However,

746
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,630
I can't keep teaching you

747
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,670
without a proper title, can I?

748
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,400
How about this?

749
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,830
Let's use wine instead of tea.

750
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,360
You offer me

751
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,810
a bowl in respect as a student,

752
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,620
and from today on,

753
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,480
I'll teach you everything I know.

754
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,230
What do you say?

755
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,960
Well...

756
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,680
let me think about it.

757
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,200
If you're going to teach me,

758
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,830
teach me more.

759
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,630
Besides

760
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,070
serving tea and wine to the Crown Prince,

761
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,470
what else should I learn?

762
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,960
What should I learn

763
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,230
to make the Crown Prince happy?

764
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,360
What else can you do?

765
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,760
Should I...

766
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,800
learn…

767
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,480
like…

768
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,510
singing songs?

769
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,190
Or...

770
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,760
And who's being petty now?
