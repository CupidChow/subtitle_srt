[Episode 9]

3
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,410
Don't come any closer!

4
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,170
Let me help you.

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,490
Don't come near me!

6
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,710
Don't come!

7
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,250
Wait.

8
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,810
What are you doing?

9
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,360
I've consumed countless spirit herbs.

10
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,310
My blood might be effective.

11
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,220
Heavenly Lord,

12
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,079
I have a question.

13
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,079
What is it?

14
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:09,720
If this place

15
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,010
is just an illusion created by Honglian,

16
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,630
then why did she put so many

17
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,960
ice petals containing her memories here?

18
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,860
Do you think what we just saw

19
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,840
was real or fake?

20
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,880
We can only ask Li Mo about that.

21
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,840
I feel it's real.

22
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,590
You also know

23
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,470
that Honglian's feelings
for Immortal Lord Li Mo

24
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,070
are now a mix of love and hate.

25
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,190
But in the memories we just saw,

26
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,040
Immortal Lord Li Mo
wasn't portrayed negatively.

27
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,310
I don't think Honglian has a reason

28
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,370
to create fake memories for us to see.

29
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
Also, you mentioned before

30
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,120
that Honglian was sealed for centuries.

31
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Her spiritual energy is
much weaker than before.

32
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Creating an illusion that could trap you

33
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
certainly wouldn't be
an easy task for her.

34
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
So I have an idea.

35
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,830
You want to...

36
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,290
Destroy everything here.

37
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,440
Stand behind me.

38
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
Is that her true form?

39
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,170
Yes.

40
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,040
I guessed correctly.

41
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,370
Those illusions are indeed her true form.

42
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,230
Little girl, I really underestimated you.

43
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,480
Heavenly Lord, quickly capture her!

44
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,540
Honglian, return to Hell Ruins with me

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
and I'll spare your life.

46
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,000
Heavenly Lord!

47
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,120
Heavenly Lord!

48
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,960
Help!

49
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,040
Help!

50
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Help!

51
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,800
Help! Help!

52
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,560
What's wrong?

53
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
He's come back to life!

54
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,410
My husband...

55
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,210
My husband has come back to life!

56
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,040
Don't be afraid. Take me to see him.

57
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,600
Let's go.

58
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,800
Don't waste your energy anymore.

59
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,090
Yun, exorcise the evil.

60
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:19,800
Release.

61
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,140
This isn't a resurrected corpse.

62
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,250
It's just the most basic form of puppetry.

63
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,400
I've already deactivated the control.

64
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,730
Everything is fine now.

65
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,240
Could you please help me tie him up?

66
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,610
I'm afraid it might happen again.

67
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,550
Alright, go find some rope.

68
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,440
Bai Jiusi.

69
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,730
Your spiritual energy

70
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,600
has decreased significantly
compared to before.

71
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,860
It seems that forcing you to come
out of seclusion this time

72
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,560
has caused you severe internal injuries.

73
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,270
Do you know what's the biggest weakness

74
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,160
you immortals have?

75
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
It's that you trust humans too much.

76
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,350
You should know that sometimes,
the human heart is scarier

77
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,190
than demons.

78
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,200
This is the binding method
taught by my sect.

79
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,960
Even if he's controlled by someone
again in the future,

80
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,620
he won't be able to break free.

81
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,200
Thank you, miss.

82
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,380
I have other matters to attend to,
so I'll take my leave.

83
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,920
In the illusion, I saw you

84
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,290
place the Twin Heart Seal on Li Qingyue.

85
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,210
If I remember correctly,

86
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,210
besides sensing location,

87
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,530
if the person under the seal
gets injured,

88
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,060
the one who drew the seal
also bears half the injury.

89
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,270
If Li Qingyue dies,

90
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,080
will you lose half of your lifespan?

91
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,830
Trying to run?

92
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,240
Not so fast!

93
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,670
It's you.

94
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,790
Why did you...

95
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,400
Why did you come to investigate?

96
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,410
What?

97
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,910
That bastard Xu Ying died. So what?

98
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,810
Why did you come to investigate?

99
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,200
You killed Xu Ying?

100
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,510
He deserved to die!

101
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,150
Beautiful lady, where are you going?

102
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,810
Husband, where are you going?

103
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,180
It's you again.

104
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,050
It's none of your business!

105
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,390
You're so annoying! Leave me alone.

106
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,120
Get lost!

107
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,120
You're drunk.

108
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,480
You're drunk. Let's go home.

109
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,410
I'm telling you!

110
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,550
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

111
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,840
You're either crying and whining

112
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,100
or you're nagging and complaining to me.

113
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,630
If you say another word, I'll get angry.

114
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,520
If you try to stop me, I'll hit you again.

115
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,840
Husband!

116
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,080
Beautiful lady.

117
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,150
Husband!

118
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,480
Beautiful lady.

119
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,320
Beautiful lady.

120
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
Beautiful lady.

121
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
Beautiful lady.

122
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,790
Beautiful lady.

123
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,360
Beautiful lady.

124
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,240
You—

125
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
That's right.

126
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
Beautiful lady.

127
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,440
-Beauty.
-That’s me too.

128
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,080
I've come for you.

129
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,150
Dear,

130
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,360
I'm not the one you should be afraid of.

131
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,200
Is it worth it for a man like him?

132
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,270
Do you really want to

133
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,030
continue living like this?

134
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,480
Beautiful lady,

135
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,200
where are you?

136
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,750
Beautiful lady?

137
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,390
Where are you?

138
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,430
I was just thinking,

139
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,750
why would a person change?

140
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,140
We grew up together since childhood.

141
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,390
Why did he become so unfamiliar?

142
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,840
I just wanted to see
if he still had a heart.

143
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,390
He clearly had a heart.

144
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,150
Why would he do such heartless things?

145
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,870
So before we arrived,

146
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,240
you had already conspired with Honglian.

147
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,830
Conspired?

148
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,910
She was helping me.

149
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,390
Unlike you two.

150
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,200
You don't distinguish right from wrong
and just talk about hunting demons.

151
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,640
Why don't you deal with those who do evil?

152
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,150
You only target pitiful people like us.

153
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
We do distinguish right from wrong.

154
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,720
We just didn't know

155
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
about your husband's character before.

156
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,080
You did nothing wrong.
He did deserve to die.

157
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,140
Don't give me that.

158
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,120
I don't believe in cultivators like you

159
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,240
who change your tune

160
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,170
when talking to different people.

161
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,030
Honglian did me such a big favor.

162
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,920
Now it's time for me to help her.

163
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,240
Bai Jiusi, let's see how you
can defeat me.

164
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,310
You're really hard to kill, aren't you?

165
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,800
You still won't die?

166
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,440
If your throat is cut,

167
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,820
can you still live?

168
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,270
This is a pill to stop bleeding
and heal wounds.

169
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,200
Take it quickly.

170
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,060
Master will surely blame me this time.

171
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,150
The person who hurt me
is in league with Honglian.

172
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,000
The Heavenly Lord has already
gone after Honglian.

173
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,570
He might be in danger now.

174
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,250
We need to find him quickly.

175
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,109
Li Mo,

176
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,579
you've finally come to see me.

177
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:33,930
Heavenly Lord!

178
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,740
Are you alright?

179
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,130
Immortal Lord Li Mo!

180
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,750
Go.

181
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,250
You can't leave!

182
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,030
You actually hurt me?

183
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,510
This Sky-Reaching Ladder was made of
the essence of heaven and earth.

184
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,200
It harnesses the essence of heaven
and transforms the waters.

185
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,530
It connects heaven and earth,
transcending the six realms.

186
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,450
If you wish to achieve what others cannot,

187
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,500
you must endure suffering
that others cannot bear.

188
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,160
Fierce winds will temper your body;
raging fires will burn your flesh.

189
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,720
Can you withstand the pain

190
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,330
of tearing muscles and shattering bones?

191
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,310
Honglian is a great water demon.

192
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,160
Using fire to counter her
is an excellent method,

193
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,880
but your own essence is also of yin water.

194
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,140
Where did you get so much yang fire power?

195
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,030
Master, your old illness hasn't healed.

196
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,880
I didn't bring any miraculous medicine
this time.

197
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,210
Now that you've injured your foundation,

198
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,800
you won't heal
without a few months of rest.

199
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,960
This...

200
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,400
How can you be so weak?

201
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,160
Didn't you obtain the Blazing Fire magic
from Siling long ago?

202
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,020
How could it suddenly disappear?

203
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,890
It wouldn't vanish into thin air.

204
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,200
Power waxes and wanes.

205
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,590
If it's not with me,

206
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,930
it must be hidden somewhere else.

207
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,410
Master, you still suspect...

208
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,760
Heavenly Lord, you're better now?

209
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,610
Have something to eat.

210
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,810
The Heavenly Lord doesn't need to eat.

211
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,010
Immortal Lord Li Mo,
would you like to eat something too?

212
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,070
No need.

213
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,270
What should we do next?

214
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,210
Are we going to catch Honglian?

215
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,350
Time is too tight.

216
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,790
I've only treated Master's
external injuries.

217
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,920
His internal injuries are severe now.

218
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,430
He needs time to recover.

219
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,750
It's not advisable to
confront Honglian again.

220
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,480
But we still have you, don't we?

221
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,290
I'm no match for Honglian.

222
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,750
But you just sent her flying

223
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,950
with one palm strike.

224
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,560
Then let's go back to Canglei Palace
for reinforcements.

225
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,150
We can't leave.

226
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,090
What do you mean?

227
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,160
My spiritual energy is damaged
and greatly diminished.

228
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,110
And this Honglian

229
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,570
has been hiding
her true strength all along.

230
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,260
She just altered the barrier
formation I set up.

231
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,650
Now, the ones who can't leave this place

232
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,880
have become us.

233
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,110
It's alright.

234
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,610
Judging by the time,

235
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,790
Long Yuan should be back from
reporting to Empyrean by now.

236
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,050
He will surely come here when he returns.

237
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,800
So before that, we can only
hide from Honglian?

238
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,010
That's all we can do.

239
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,140
We have no chance of winning
in a direct confrontation.

240
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,200
Honglian has been looking for you.

241
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,830
I'm afraid she won't
let us hide like this.

242
00:22:53,550 --> 00:23:03,630
[Songhe County]

243
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,200
Immortal Lord Li Mo.

244
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,160
The Heavenly Lord and I saw your past

245
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,220
in the illusion created by Honglian.

246
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,750
In her memories,

247
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,790
weren't you two quite close?

248
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,440
How did it come to this?

249
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,030
The Heavenly Lord didn't ask before
out of respect for your choice,

250
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,490
but we can't avoid
talking about it anymore.

251
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,550
You might as well tell us.

252
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,200
Maybe I...

253
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,640
And the Heavenly Lord can help.

254
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,730
How much do you know?

255
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,720
I know that in the past, you wanted to
help Honglian dispel her evil energy.

256
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,450
You even fed her your own blood.

257
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,400
By all rights, she should be
very grateful to you.

258
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,940
Why do you still need to hide from her?

259
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,530
I hide from her because
I don't want her obsession to deepen.

260
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,590
Obsession?

261
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,830
Honglian used to hurt people
for the blood of their hearts.

262
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,490
It was only to
dispel the evil energy in her body.

263
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,110
After I met her,

264
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,880
I kept her by my side for decades.

265
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,110
At first, I just wanted to
find a way to cure her.

266
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,760
I never thought that in the end,

267
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,960
I would cause her to develop
another illness.

268
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,830
What illness?

269
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,040
The illness of jealousy.

270
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,240
Li Mo.

271
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,220
What... what are you doing?

272
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,480
Why are you holding her?

273
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,680
I'm giving her medicine.

274
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,270
Didn't you say you were going
to cure my illness?

275
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,480
Why are you taking care of them now?

276
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,200
I will find a way to cure your illness.

277
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,330
I won't neglect you.

278
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,270
Aren't you neglecting me right now?

279
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,040
You're the same as them.

280
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,080
I will treat everyone equally.

281
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,110
You're using your blood to save others?

282
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,240
Don't make it known.

283
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,160
If others find out,

284
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,540
they might mistake me for a demon.

285
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
It's fine. It'll heal after I
apply some medicine.

286
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,300
So this is how you treat everyone.

287
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,680
What?

288
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,570
What are you doing?

289
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,350
Li Mo.

290
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Can't you see that I like you?

291
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,310
You don't need to use such tactics on me.

292
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,170
My heart's blood cannot save you.

293
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,010
Since I promised you

294
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,240
to find another way to
dispel your evil energy,

295
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,040
I will do it.

296
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,720
You don't believe that I love you?

297
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,880
Whether I believe it or not
is meaningless.

298
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,810
I've said before

299
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,030
that I only care about saving people.

300
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,490
I have no interest in love.

301
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,790
Stop it.

302
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,650
If that's the case,

303
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,780
then I'm the only one you can save.

304
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,570
As a cultivator,

305
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,690
how can I only save one person?

306
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,350
If you continue to act recklessly,
you'll disturb my cultivation.

307
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,080
Then I won't be able to
keep you by my side anymore.

308
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,000
Come.

309
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,200
What have you done?

310
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,510
If you want to save someone,
you can only save me.

311
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,830
Your blood can only be given to me.

312
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,120
What have you done?

313
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,920
I am a flower that grew by
the Naihe Bridge.

314
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,250
I carry evil energy.

315
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,070
Your blood can save people,

316
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,480
while my blood can kill people.

317
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,550
Don't you think we're a perfect match?

318
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,500
Why did you

319
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,540
take their lives?

320
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,180
Only by making you kill them
with your own hands,

321
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,820
ending their lives,

322
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,200
will you

323
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,550
stop saving others in the future.

324
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,000
I told you,

325
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,680
you can only save me.

326
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,000
Now it's all good.

327
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,720
You don't have to be troubled anymore.

328
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,170
From now on, I'm the only one
who needs your salvation.

329
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,610
What happened then?

330
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,620
After that,

331
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,000
I couldn't bear the fact
that I had unintentionally killed people.

332
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,980
I didn't want to see Honglian ever again.

333
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,110
So you started avoiding her?

334
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,080
I practice the way of medicine.

335
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,530
I can only save people.

336
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,680
I can't kill her.

337
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,680
Were you the one who
approached the Heavenly Lord

338
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,940
to help seal Honglian?

339
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,270
No.

340
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,680
It just so happened that Master and...

341
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,480
Divine Lord Siling.

342
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,000
Yes.

343
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,590
They happened to travel to the village.

344
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,310
They worked together to seal Honglian.

345
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,840
Because of this,
I became Master's disciple.

346
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,990
But I felt guilty inside.

347
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
She insists on seeing you every day.

348
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,750
Are you really not going to
see her even once?

349
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,000
My sins are heavy.

350
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,310
Now, I only wish to travel
in the mortal realm

351
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,310
and do good deeds

352
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,550
to atone for the sins I've committed.

353
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,930
What about her?

354
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,930
Are you just going to abandon her?

355
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,280
I overestimated myself.

356
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,160
I once foolishly thought I could save her.

357
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,470
That's what led to such a grave mistake.

358
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,580
Now that she has been sealed,

359
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,460
I trouble you, Master, to watch over her.

360
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,500
She is a tribulation in your destiny.

361
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,160
You can't escape it no matter how you try.

362
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,860
I have no desire to
face this tribulation again.

363
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,030
I beg for your understanding.

364
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,240
Did you really
never have feelings for Honglian?

365
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,680
Never.

366
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,240
Have you ever had feelings for anyone?

367
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,510
No.

368
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,590
No wonder.

369
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,160
Of course you can't understand

370
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,400
the stubbornness of someone who's
just tasted love for the first time.

371
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,480
It's not jealousy.

372
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,350
It's possessiveness born out of love.

373
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,600
I've seen how Honglian acts
around other men.

374
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,550
It's all an act.

375
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,920
She only treats you differently.

376
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,980
I suppose it's her first time
learning to love someone.

377
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,970
What do you mean by that?

378
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,160
I'm just thinking out loud.

379
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,110
Honglian's actions were
indeed gravely wrong,

380
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,190
but she's a demon.

381
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,510
As you said,

382
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,720
she's been tormented
by evil energy since birth.

383
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,000
She's protecting herself.

384
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,370
No one taught her to distinguish
between right and wrong.

385
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,830
But if you had calmly explained

386
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,460
everything to her from the very beginning,

387
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
guiding her to let go of her grievances,

388
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,520
wouldn't that have prevented
the later disaster?

389
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,070
Of course, you have no
romantic feelings for Honglian.

390
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,730
That's not your fault either.

391
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,110
It's just that you've been
avoiding her ever since,

392
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,910
allowing her to become crazier.

393
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,270
That's a bit inappropriate.

394
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,140
I didn't expect you to be so well-versed
in matters of love.

395
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,240
When it comes to love, I'm an expert.

396
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,740
I wholeheartedly love
the Heavenly Lord, you know.

397
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,110
Master is just circulating
his energy to heal.

398
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,150
He can hear our conversation.

399
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,420
I know.

400
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,140
I'm saying this on purpose
for him to hear.

401
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,050
Immortal Lord Li Mo,

402
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,200
why do I feel that the Heavenly Lord's
spiritual energy

403
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,440
is a bit chaotic?

404
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,390
Has his condition worsened?

405
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,139
But getting back to the point,

406
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,670
I always felt that you loved her.

407
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,360
-Never.
-Don’t rush to deny it.

408
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,280
There are countless forms
of love in this world.

409
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,880
It's not just romantic love.

410
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,719
What's wrong?

411
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,690
Be careful.

412
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,580
This is...

413
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,900
Honglian's water spiritual energy.

414
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,699
Has she discovered us?

415
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,740
No.

416
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,130
But she's forcing us to reveal ourselves.

417
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,920
Forcing us?

418
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,000
Is she trying to...

419
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Freeze the whole Songhe County.

420
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,830
What about the people inside?

421
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,550
[Songhe County]

422
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,150
We can't wait for Long Yuan anymore.

423
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,350
If we wait any longer,

424
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,960
all the people in Songhe County
will suffer.

425
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,420
My Lady was right earlier.

426
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,000
It was my constant avoidance

427
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
that led Honglian
to make mistake after mistake.

428
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,860
It's time to go and
resolve this conflict with her.

429
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,110
We'll go with you.

430
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,920
You don't understand love.

431
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,110
I'm afraid you might
say the wrong thing again

432
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,370
and make things worse.

433
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,210
Let's go together.

434
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,400
This shield will protect you
from the ice.

435
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,290
There's no time to waste. Let's go.

436
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,030
Honglian.

437
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,070
Stop this.

438
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,410
After all these years,

439
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,480
you still can't change your bad habit
of wanting to save people.

440
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,230
You wanted to see me, and I'm here now.

441
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,120
Don't harm the people of Songhe County.

442
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,320
I did want to see you.

443
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,360
But during the centuries I've been sealed,

444
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,720
why didn't you come to see me even once?

445
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,490
Are you still resenting me

446
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,620
for making you kill?

447
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,710
In that case,

448
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,760
why don't I make you bear
the burden of more deaths,

449
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,820
so you won't dare to avoid me anymore?

450
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,510
No!

451
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,810
Master, you can't recklessly use
your spiritual energy anymore.

452
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,930
I'll help the Heavenly Lord.

453
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,060
Speak more gently.

454
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,850
Quickly resolve those
old grudges between you.

455
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,690
Go quickly.

456
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,740
This time, I won't run away
from you anymore.

457
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,850
Don't make the same mistake again.

458
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,840
I'll accompany you to atone for

459
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,330
the sins you committed in the past.

460
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,760
Sins?

461
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,680
I never thought those were sins.

462
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,230
You were the one who volunteered

463
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,440
to help me dispel the evil energy
in my body.

464
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,360
It was also you

465
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,600
who abandoned me

466
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,230
to save others.

467
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,620
You're the one who's sinned all along.

468
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,440
I never intended to abandon you.

469
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,100
But you clearly did just that.

470
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,230
For hundreds of years,

471
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,710
I've been tormented by evil energy.

472
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,710
I've never trusted anyone,

473
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,630
except you.

474
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,900
But what about you?

475
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,510
In the end, you were only thinking
about how to get rid of me.

476
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,280
I didn't.

477
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,710
You said you studied the way of medicine,

478
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,890
that you were born to help others,

479
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,440
but you couldn't even save me.

480
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,520
How can you save anyone else?

481
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,000
How are you any different

482
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,860
from those men who abandon women?

483
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,560
Immortal Lord Li Mo, the Heavenly Lord
can't hold on much longer.

484
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,180
Right or wrong, there's no point
in arguing further.

485
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,700
Honglian, if you just stop,

486
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,930
I promise you

487
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,490
that before I dispel the evil energy
in your body,

488
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,090
I won't interfere in
others' affairs anymore.

489
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,000
This time, I'll keep my word.

490
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,240
Then do you love me?

491
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,830
Immortal Lord Li Mo,
just say you love her.

492
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,130
What difference would it make anyway?

493
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,800
I...

494
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,810
There's no need.

495
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,050
I don't need those words anymore.

496
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,450
Honglian.

497
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,250
Honglian, what are you going to do?

498
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,220
Heavenly Lord!

499
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,180
Heavenly Lord!

500
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,880
Honglian, that's enough.

501
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,360
Heavenly Lord!

502
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,960
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

503
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,820
Rise.

504
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,570
Heavenly Lord!

505
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,540
Yue.

506
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,510
It's you.
