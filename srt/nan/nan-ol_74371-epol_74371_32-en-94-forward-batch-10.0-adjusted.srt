[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,840
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:01,360
I, daughter-in-law Shen Wan,
pay my respects to you, Father.

4
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,229
Chief General.

5
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,960
I, Bai Feng,

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,970
kowtow to you.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,450
His Majesty has decreed

8
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,009
that tomorrow at 6 a.m.,

9
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,060
we shall leave the city for burial.

10
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,009
No wake

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,250
and no mourning?

12
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
His Majesty said that

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,320
Father died at the hands of
the nomadic enemies,

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,450
so holding a wake or mourning rite
would be a breach of propriety.

15
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,050
How could His Majesty
speak such absurd words?

16
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,370
Wan.

17
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,010
Help me.

18
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,640
Father.

19
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,290
This is Shen Wan,

20
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,840
the woman I've chosen as my wife.

21
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,970
If you suffered any injustice,

22
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,130
the two of us will definitely
seek justice for you.

23
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,640
Father, you've tragically passed away,

24
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,850
and I, Shen Wan, your daughter-in-law,

25
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,500
have to perform an autopsy.

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,970
If there's any offense,

27
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,500
please forgive me, Father.

28
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,930
Wan.

29
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,480
We only have six hours.

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,420
Time is tight.

31
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,380
Just tell me

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,930
what you need me to examine.

33
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,290
I want to know

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,360
whether Father was truly killed
by the nomadic enemies.

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,920
Okay.

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,320
I'll focus on examining the murder weapon

37
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,780
and the method of killing.

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,800
There're a total of

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,329
17 wounds on Father's body.

40
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,290
There are seven abrasions

41
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,079
on the left shoulder,

42
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,120
back,

43
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,290
right wrist bone,

44
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,570
and right calf.

45
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,730
There're four impact or collision injuries

46
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,570
on the chest and abdomen.

47
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,420
The fatal wound is on the chest,

48
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,820
caused by a sharp arrow
piercing the heart.

49
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,420
Where was Father attacked?

50
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,970
Father was attacked
while on a border patrol,

51
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,900
during a brief rest at a posthouse.

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,800
These are the grain husks I found

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,930
in Father's hair, used for horse feeding.

54
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,080
Father's limbs

55
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,960
all have groove-shaped blood stains.

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,610
It appears that during the fight,

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,960
someone threw bran in his face,

58
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,050
blocking his vision,

59
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,400
then bound his limbs.

60
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,159
This method of restraint

61
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,130
could even control a bull.

62
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,480
At that time,
Father was preparing to depart

63
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,740
and had sent his personal guard, Fan Xin,
to lead his horse from the backyard.

64
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Father practiced martial arts continuously
throughout his life.

65
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,840
If it weren't for such a vicious method,

66
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,760
it would have been impossible
to subdue him.

67
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,960
Since the killer wanted to kill Father,

68
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,610
they could have simply used
a rope to choke him.

69
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,200
Why go to the trouble

70
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,370
to bind his limbs?

71
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,200
Unless...

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,580
Why is this arrow wound

73
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,560
different from ordinary ones?

74
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,480
It's a four-edged arrow.

75
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,810
This is a weapon unique to
the nomadic enemies.

76
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,760
Since the arrowhead is heavy

77
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
and has barbs,

78
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,680
regular bows cannot shoot them.

79
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,880
This kind of arrow can only be fired
using a hand crossbow.

80
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,960
Since they had already bound

81
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,440
Father's limbs with rope,

82
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,550
wouldn't using a hand crossbow

83
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,080
seem too deliberate?

84
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,940
Could it be that

85
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
they wanted to...

86
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,640
They wanted to trap Father

87
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,130
and then create the illusion of
him being shot through the heart.

88
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,159
How could they act so boldly

89
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,000
without anyone noticing?

90
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,679
By the time Fan Xin arrived,

91
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,610
Father had already been shot
with the arrow and died.

92
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,100
G-General...

93
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,130
General!

94
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,930
When the killer left,

95
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,890
they deliberately took the ropes

96
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,750
that bound Father's limbs

97
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,370
and left behind the four-edged arrow,

98
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,680
as if to make it known that

99
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,450
it was done by the nomadic enemies.

100
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,150
Was that a provocation against
the Shuoxi Army?

101
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,040
The nomadic enemies have harbored a deep
and long-standing hatred for Father,

102
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,760
and they reward deeds with decapitation.

103
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,320
If it was really a provocation
from the nomadic enemies,

104
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,370
Father's body would certainly
not be intact.

105
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,850
If it wasn't the nomadic enemies,

106
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,320
then someone's trying to frame them.

107
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,490
The killer must be familiar with
the nomadic enemies' weapons.

108
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,400
And they're also familiar with Father's
border patrol routes.

109
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,440
If that's the case,

110
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,210
those within the Shuoxi Army
are the most suspicious.

111
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,730
It's time to meet Fan Xin.

112
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,970
When you passed through the posthouse,

113
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,230
did you notice any traces of foreigners?

114
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,040
No.

115
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,800
After the Crown Prince of Beidai
had an accident,

116
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,260
His Lordship had already ordered
strict border inspections.

117
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,250
Then, General,

118
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,560
did you get a good look at
the assassinator's appearance?

119
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,250
No.

120
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,920
By the time I arrived,

121
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,180
the villains had already fled,

122
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,640
and His Lordship and our men
were already...

123
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,330
General Fan, you've followed His Lordship
for many years.

124
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,760
Have you ever seen the nomadic enemies
use rope formations

125
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,250
to encircle our soldiers and civilians?

126
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,640
Rope formations?

127
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,680
How does Your Highness know about this?

128
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,010
What do you mean by that?

129
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,160
Young Marshal, you may not know this,

130
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,560
but after you entered the capital,

131
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,960
His Lordship ordered the Tianshu Camp

132
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,280
to adapt our Zhou's meteor hammer

133
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,630
into a rope formation,

134
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,010
specifically to force
the nomadic enemies to surrender.

135
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,470
Besides the Tianshu Camp,

136
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,250
who else knows about this formation?

137
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,090
No one.

138
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,130
Such a confidential formation

139
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,970
is known only to His Lordship

140
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,650
and the soldiers of the Tianshu Camp.

141
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,000
The Tianshu Camp?

142
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,340
The Tianshu Camp

143
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,850
is a special unit within the Shuoxi Army

144
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,250
dedicated to assassinating enemy generals.

145
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,110
Could it be that

146
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,370
there really is a traitor
within the Shuoxi Army?

147
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,830
I never thought Father would die
at the hands of our own people.

148
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,930
Father.

149
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,180
I, Shen Wan, hereby swear that

150
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,640
no matter who killed you,

151
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,890
I will do everything in my power,

152
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,590
together with Yan Chi,

153
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,640
to avenge your bloodshed.

154
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,050
[Funing Palace]

155
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,440
I want to see my son.

156
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
Your Majesty, you cannot go!

157
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,850
I want to see him.

158
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,640
I beg Your Majesty
to prioritize your health above all else!

159
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,840
My son...

160
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,890
His Majesty arrives!

161
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,220
-I need to see him.
-Mother!

162
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,940
Mother, what are you trying to do?

163
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,090
-What is this for, Mother?
-I want to see my son.

164
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,730
Mother...

165
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,880
All of you, step back.

166
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,160
Quick.

167
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,580
Mother.

168
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,130
Please listen to me.

169
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,640
Once you've

170
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,520
fully recovered,

171
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,400
I'll

172
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,040
personally accompany you

173
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,400
to pay respects to Lin.
How does that sound?

174
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,890
By then,

175
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,040
I will only be able to see a tomb.

176
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,280
Don't stop me. Let me go!

177
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,130
Mother. Mother.

178
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,760
I had no choice in this matter, either.

179
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,890
I am not only his elder brother,

180
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,210
but also the ruler of this country.

181
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,920
I have to prioritize state affairs.

182
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,670
What does that matter?

183
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,850
Lin was

184
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,250
always loyal to you.

185
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,670
Since your coronation,

186
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,330
he guarded the border for over 20 years.

187
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,810
Without your orders,

188
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,120
he would never step a foot
beyond the Shuoxi border,

189
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,890
yet you always treated him
as a grave threat.

190
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,970
Even after his death,

191
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,980
you were stingy
in handling his funeral matters.

192
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,370
What kind of emperor are you?

193
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,630
What kind of elder brother are you?

194
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,640
Mother, it's all my fault

195
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,640
for making you so heartbroken.

196
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,250
But Mother,

197
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,800
Lin's sudden death

198
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,680
will surely cause turmoil
at the border and in court.

199
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,210
I

200
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,520
have no choice but
to simplify the funeral ceremonies.

201
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,280
It's also to stabilize the border

202
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,880
and ensure a smooth transfer

203
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,370
of the Shuoxi Army's command.

204
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,920
For the sake of your court,

205
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,890
I've compromised again and again.

206
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,210
Am I supposed to compromise to the point
where I can't even

207
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,970
see my son one last time?

208
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,620
I might as well

209
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,640
not serve as Empress Dowager anymore!

210
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,130
Mother!

211
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,350
Is it that

212
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,440
you only

213
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,040
care about Lin?

214
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,180
Then what about me?

215
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,090
I am

216
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,230
also your

217
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,130
own flesh and blood.

218
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,370
Are you saying the victim

219
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,230
was Prince Jin's personal guard,

220
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,640
Song Xiwen?

221
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,890
A man who should have been imprisoned
in the Imperial Punishment Department

222
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,620
ended up dead
at the Disgraced Prince's mansion.

223
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,290
This matter

224
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,160
is indeed suspicious.

225
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Your Majesty.

226
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,130
The case of the Disgraced Prince
has long been concluded.

227
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,470
Even if the deceased is truly Song Xiwen,

228
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,520
he's merely a guard of no consequence
to the bigger picture,

229
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,160
and escaping prison
is itself a capital offense.

230
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,800
If we investigate this case further,

231
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,250
stirring up settled matters

232
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,370
and muddying clear waters,

233
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,560
it would be unwise.

234
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,810
Your Majesty.

235
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,250
Marquis of Zhongyong makes a valid point.

236
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,440
However, there are many rumors about
the male corpse found

237
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,160
at the Disgraced Prince's mansion,
and if we neglect to investigate,

238
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,680
I fear it will only
increase public suspicion

239
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,480
and create new complications over
the Disgraced Prince's old case.

240
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Li Muyun.

241
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,010
This case was to be supervised
by your Supreme Court.

243
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,660
How do you plan to handle it?

244
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,890
Your Majesty.

245
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,110
I believe

246
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,970
this case must be investigated.

247
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,370
For the reputation of the Supreme Court,
it must be investigated.

248
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,850
For the peace of the court,
it must be investigated even more.

249
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,210
I am willing to thoroughly
investigate this case,

250
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,400
so as to provide Your Majesty,

251
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,490
the court,

252
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,770
and the people of Zhou
with a proper explanation.

253
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,950
Since Prince Rui has recently passed away,

254
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,710
his son, Yan Chi, is in mourning.

255
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,130
Thus, this case shall be

256
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,680
handled by Prince Cheng, Yan Qi,
as the acting official.

257
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,160
The Supreme Court shall assist
Prince Cheng in supervising this case.

258
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,090
-Yes, Father.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

259
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,260
[Funing Palace]

260
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,480
Why have you returned so soon?

261
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,079
Is everything taken care of?

262
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,230
Father has been properly buried.

263
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,400
Given the current situation,

264
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,530
the sooner I return,

265
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,530
the more at ease His Majesty will be.

266
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,460
Do you know that

267
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,480
His Majesty has assigned Song Xiwen's case

268
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,770
to Prince Cheng?

269
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,800
I do.

270
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,960
Wan.

271
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,480
If I lose my position
at the Ministry of Justice

272
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,210
and fail to inherit the throne,

273
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,770
would you still be willing to marry me?

274
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,480
I could open a medical clinic

275
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,530
and support you quite comfortably.

276
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,630
Yan Chi.

277
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,240
I don't want to wait for
some auspicious date anymore.

278
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,530
I'll go ask the Empress Dowager
to grant us permission to marry.

279
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,790
It's just I don't know if you're willing.

280
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:06,960
Wan...

281
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,220
Your Highness, Princess Yongci.

282
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,130
The Empress Dowager has risen.

283
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Thank you, Madam.

284
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
Your Majesty.

285
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,660
Your father, he...

286
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,610
Grandmother.

287
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,610
Father spent his entire life
on the battlefield.

288
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,010
He had long been prepared
for this outcome.

289
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,640
I've arranged everything for his funeral.

290
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,500
Please take good care of yourself

291
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,700
and try to accept this loss.

292
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,290
Your Majesty.

293
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,020
Please let me check your pulse.

294
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,970
This is a heart ailment.

295
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,250
Once I come to terms with it,

296
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,260
I will be fine.

297
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,850
Grandmother.

298
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,090
Father spent his entire life
on the battlefield,

299
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,020
never having a single day of peace.

300
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,070
Before he passed away,

301
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,640
I failed to let him see me get married
or establish a career.

302
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,720
I wish to wed Princess Yongci
as soon as possible

303
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
during the mourning period

304
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,550
to comfort Father's spirit,

305
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,860
so he may rest in peace.

306
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,970
I hope you will grant this wish,
Grandmother.

307
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,630
Marrying during the mourning period

308
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,370
will surely invite criticism.

309
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,120
If the ceremony has to be simple,

310
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,690
I fear it would be unfair to you.

311
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,650
Your Majesty.

312
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,610
This is what I originally wanted
to ask of you,

313
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,960
but Yan Chi beat me to it.

314
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,380
I've even worked as a coroner,

315
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,740
so why would I fear others' criticism?

316
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,460
As long as Yan Chi and I are of one mind,

317
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,680
I won't feel wronged.

318
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,430
Heaven took away one of my sons,

319
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,950
but in return, it gave me
such a wonderful granddaughter-in-law.

320
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,530
So be it.

321
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,440
I'll have the Imperial Astronomical Bureau
select an auspicious date

322
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,850
for your wedding.

323
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,650
-Thank you, Grandmother.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

324
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,890
Royal Guardian, Madam.

325
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Prince Cheng

326
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,040
wishes to take Lady Xiang
as his concubine.

327
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,480
He hopes you will accept
these betrothal gifts

328
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
and make preparations soon.

329
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,560
Our Qin family tradition

330
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,480
forbids legitimate daughters
from becoming concubines.

331
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,920
There must be some misunderstanding
on Prince Cheng's part.

332
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,290
Prince Cheng specifically emphasized that

333
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,640
Lady Xiang volunteered
to be his concubine.

334
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,400
If Your Grace has any doubts,

335
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,720
why not ask Lady Xiang to come out
and confirm it with her yourself?

336
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,850
That's impossible!

337
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,200
A daughter of our Qin family

338
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
could never serve as someone's attendant!

339
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,200
I am willing.

340
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,680
Don't talk nonsense!

341
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,900
Zhaoyu will soon marry into
the Eastern Palace.

342
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,890
If you become Prince Cheng's concubine,

343
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,090
where will the reputation of the Empress,
the Crown Prince,

344
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,440
and the Qin family

345
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,480
stand?

346
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm the eldest legitimate daughter
of the third branch.

347
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,550
What does it have to do with Zhaoyu

348
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,420
whether I become a consort or concubine?

349
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,350
-Honey.
-You...

350
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,780
Please go back and tell Prince Cheng that

351
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,770
this matter has come up suddenly.

352
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,290
After I get to understand
the full situation,

353
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,220
I will give His Highness my answer.

354
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,430
I, Xiang, have been unfilial.

355
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,060
I've already been intimate
with Prince Cheng.

356
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,000
Prince Cheng promised

357
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,640
he would treat me well for life.

358
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
I beg you to offer your blessings,
Uncle and Aunt.

359
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,130
You wretch!

360
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,230
Your Grace.

361
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,770
Lady Xiang

362
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,090
is now Prince Cheng's concubine.

363
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,380
Even if you wish to discipline her,

364
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
you should show some restraint.

365
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,330
Get out of here.

366
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,130
Our Qin family

367
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,100
will not tolerate a disgrace like you!

368
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,350
Get out!

369
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,480
Wanhe, let's go.

370
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,370
Lady Xiang.

371
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,470
I...

372
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,810
I wish to stay and serve Lady Shuang.

373
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,480
So even you're betraying me now?

374
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,290
Since Lady Xiang
has made her thoughts clear,

375
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
I shall take my leave now.

376
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,120
Lady Xiang.

377
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,570
Please.

378
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,660
The humiliation I suffered today,

379
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,370
I will remember all of it.

380
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,120
When I rise to power in the future,

381
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,890
don't you regret it!

382
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm Qi Yu, strategist under Chief General.

383
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,710
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

384
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,130
I pay my respects to you,
Young Marshal and Princess Yongci,

385
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,730
on behalf of the Shuoxi Army.

386
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,930
No need for such formality, Sir.

387
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,640
How are things with the Shuoxi Army?

388
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,530
His Majesty ordered

389
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,260
the Ministry of War to directly take over
the Shuoxi Army's command

390
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,860
and reassigned Chief General's deputies
away from Shuoxi.

391
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,160
Since the cause of Chief General's death
remains unclear,

392
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,440
our men are filled with anger

393
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,160
and refused to obey the transfer orders.

394
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,430
Now, they've been detained
for disobeying military orders.

395
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,290
The Crown Prince and Prince Cheng

396
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,570
have taken this opportunity
to place their men in position.

397
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,440
So soon.

398
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,090
They're finally going
to reveal their true colors.

399
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,810
This reassignment from the Ministry of War

400
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,000
is the escape route
I've arranged for our men.

401
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,130
It can at least ensure everyone's safety.

402
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,370
As long as we're still alive,

403
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,830
the spirit of the Shuoxi Army
will never die.

404
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,330
As long as I still have a breath left,

405
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,210
I'll seek justice for Father

406
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,150
and avenge him.

407
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,890
I, Qi,

408
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,030
on behalf of all Shuoxi soldiers,

409
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,510
thank you, Young Marshal.

410
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,970
Please rise.

411
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,290
This is what I should do.

412
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,480
In Chief General's entire life,

413
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,480
he only sought to have no shame
before Heaven

414
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,810
and the people of Zhou.

415
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,440
I found this

416
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,770
while sorting through
Chief General's belongings.

417
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,090
It was clearly something he treasured,

418
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,260
so I came personally

419
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,410
to return it to you, Young Marshal.

420
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,430
Thank you, Sir.

421
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,690
My condolences, Young Marshal.

422
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,000
Could this be...

423
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,810
This is a portrait of Mother

424
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
specially commissioned by Father.

425
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,990
It's exactly the same as the one
in his study.

426
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,720
Father and Mother

427
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,350
truly shared a deep and devoted love.

428
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,600
Why is there blood

429
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,000
on this hair ribbon?

430
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,230
This is the hair ribbon
that the Empress Dowager

431
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,810
personally made for me
when I went to Shuoxi at age eight.

432
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,020
I didn't expect Father to have kept it
all this time.

433
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,770
Sadly, my beloved wife
passed away too soon;

434
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,500
I pity my son, left motherless
and awaiting care.

435
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,130
Yet I have a duty to guard our land,

436
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,210
and His Majesty's orders cannot be defied.

437
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,070
Despite countless reluctances,

438
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,050

507
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,230
Trusted yet doubted,

508
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,720
loyal yet slandered,

509
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,850
how can I not feel resentment?

510
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,450
However,

511
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,480
I was born to serve the country.

512
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,810
In these treacherous times at court,

513
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,340
when loyal officials
are being slaughtered,

514
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,130
how could one think only of
personal interests

515
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,720
and seek safety over duty?

516
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,960
Loyalty to country and filial piety
cannot both be fulfilled.

517
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,650
Yet

518
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,770
I have never betrayed my country,

519
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,530
though I have failed my mother, wife,
and children greatly.

520
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,970
I hope my beloved wife

521
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,700
will not harbor hatred in the afterlife.

522
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
Trusted yet doubted,

523
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,520
loyal yet slandered.

524
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,590
So Father always knew that

525
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,830
His Majesty was wary of him all along.

526
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,410
He trusted me.

527
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,720
Father understood
your loyalty and sincerity.

528
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,240
He had never doubted you.

529
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,680
He knew

530
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,440
you did it for him,

531
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,050
and to protect the Shuoxi Army.

532
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,980
Get out.

533
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,280
As the crown prince of a country,

534
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,920
acting so flustered and panicked,

535
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,130
how inappropriate.

536
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,330
Mother, have you heard?

537
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,770
Father has assigned the Song Xiwen case

538
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,170
to Yan Qi to investigate.

539
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,130
So what?

540
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,090
Yan Qi has been eager

541
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,810
to fabricate charges against me
for a long time.

542
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,370
If...

543
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,290
If he finds out that

544
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,160
it was you
who secretly released Song Xiwen,

545
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,610
he will certainly use it to cause trouble.

546
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,540
Shut your mouth!

547
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,440
Song Xiwen's case

548
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,960
has nothing to do with us.

549
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Let them investigate all they want.

550
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,400
It won't implicate us.

551
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,190
Just focus on being the Crown Prince
without worry.

552
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,610
Father.

553
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,180
The attendants responsible for
guarding Song Xiwen

554
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,160
all refused to confess.

555
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,920
I had no choice but
to use severe punishment,

556
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,650
and finally one attendant confessed.

557
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,380
The one who took Song Xiwen away

558
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,530
was the Empress's personal attendant,

559
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,240
Wan Xi.

560
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,760
Then where is

561
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,090
Wan Xi's confession statement?

562
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,960
Since this matter involves the Empress,

563
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,370
without your permission, Father,

564
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,040
I

565
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,530
dare not act on my own.

566
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,290
Stop putting on

567
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,070
that act in front of me.

568
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,580
Convey my order:

569
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,820
bring Wan Xi in for interrogation.

570
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,889
As you command, Father.

571
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:45,750
Wan Xi.

572
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,250
I will take good care of your family.

574
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,290
Go with peace of mind.

575
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,880
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

576
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,750
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

577
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,660
Sir, do you know

578
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
if there's anyone

579
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,040
in the Tianshu Camp

580
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,170
who was promoted to officer
without military merit?

581
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,080
Only the former training officer
of the Tianshu Camp,

582
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,740
Jiang Heying. A few years ago,

583
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,650
he said he wanted to return home
to care for his elderly mother.

584
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,170
Chief General appreciated
his filial piety,

585
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,170
so he recommended him for the position of
Chief Commander in his hometown, Qianzhou.

586
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,890
Why are you asking about this,
Young Marshal?

587
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,960
Because the method used
to assassinate my Father

588
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,000
is consistent with
Tianshu Camp's techniques.

589
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,850
Only those involved in developing

590
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,810
the Tianshu Camp's combat formations

591
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,670
would know the critical details.

592
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,210
The soldiers of the Shuoxi Army

593
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,210
all revere Chief General like a god.

594
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,690
How could they commit
such a treasonous act?

595
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,960
I personally performed the autopsy
on Prince Rui.

596
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,120
The wounds on his body don't lie.

597
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,220
Jiang Heying

598
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,700
owes everything he has today
to Chief General's promotion.

599
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,120
How could he dare to kill Chief General

600
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,960
and turn against the Shuoxi Army?

601
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,890
What if there was someone with power
greater than Father

602
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,220
who ordered him to do so?

603
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,690
What if he believed that person
could protect him

604
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,690
and offer him a better future?

605
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,890
Chief General already held
such high position and power.

606
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,080
The only ones with greater power
than Chief General are...

607
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,890
His Majesty,

608
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,230
or the future emperor.

609
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,370
Young Marshal, are you referring to...

610
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,370
The Crown Prince?

611
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,670
The Empress's father and brothers
command the Northern Palace Army.

612
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,290
There's no need for them
to win over the Shuoxi Army as well.

613
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,730
Besides, His Majesty has already
expressed dissatisfaction

614
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,370
with the Crown Prince's obsession
with literature

615
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,250
and lack of interest in state affairs.

616
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,810
Everyone at court knows this.

617
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,420
His Majesty's always turned a blind eye
to Prince Cheng's

618
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,000
open and covert suppression
of the Crown Prince.

619
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,770
If Jiang Heying wanted to earn merit
by supporting the future emperor,

620
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,000
of course he would choose

621
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,400
the currently ascendant

622
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,320
Prince Cheng.

623
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,730
So it's him.

624
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,170
Besides, Jiang Heying

625
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,650
was deeply trusted by Father,

626
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,400
and he knows
Father's fighting skills well.

627
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,710
He also knows the border patrol routes

628
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,840
better than anyone.

629
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,930
As well as your whereabouts.

630
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,120
If Jiang Heying has been colluding with
Prince Cheng for long, then the mastermind

631
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,440
behind the assassination attempt
on you and Father

632
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,500
was very likely Prince Cheng, Yan Qi.

633
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,370
If it was Prince Cheng,

634
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,300
we still have ways to deal with him.

635
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,400
But if the one who ordered Jiang Heying

636
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,920
is His Majesty himself,

637
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,120
what should we do then?

638
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,210
Whether it's His Majesty or Prince Cheng,

639
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,870
we must proceed with caution.

640
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,370
The top priority now

641
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,250
is to protect the current strength
of the Shuoxi Army.

642
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,850
I have to trouble you, Sir, to return
to Shuoxi

643
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,920
and tell our men

644
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
to lie low for now,

645
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,480
until I uncover the truth.

646
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,140
Then we'll plan our next move.

647
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,250
As you command, Young Marshal.

648
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,890
This time,
we might be stirring up a hornet's nest.

649
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,750
Are you afraid?

650
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,520
No.

651
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,710
Master, Princess Yongci.

652
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,480
His Majesty has ordered Prince Cheng
to interrogate Wan Xi from Fengyi Palace.

653
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,040
Did the Empress not intervene?

654
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,690
No.

655
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,440
This Wan Xi seemed prepared.

656
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
He went obediently with Prince Cheng.

657
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,890
How could someone as dominant
as the Empress

658
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,350
allow Wan Xi to be taken away
by Prince Cheng?

659
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,170
She was just cutting her losses.

660
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,370
I wasn't certain before

661
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,810
whether Song Xiwen's death

662
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,560
had anything to do with the Empress.

663
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,720
But now it seems

664
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,600
it was indeed her doing.

665
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,140
Wan Xi was so compliant,

666
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,600
as if he'd already resigned to his fate.

667
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,850
This time, Prince Cheng

668
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,780
will likely come up empty-handed.

669
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,140
Your Highness.

670
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,170
Attendant Wan is not a murder suspect.

671
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,330
Such torture

672
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,920
seems rather inappropriate.

673
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
If he had confessed earlier,

674
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,060
he would have been spared such suffering,

675
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,990
but he refuses to talk.

676
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,290
But confessions obtained through torture

677
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,150
are bound to contain falsehoods,

678
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,210
and it violates the law as well.

679
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,250
Prefect Zheng, you seem
to have forgotten that

680
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,850
this is the Supreme Court,

681
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,850
not the capital prefecture.

682
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,960
If you find this distasteful,
Prefect Zheng,

683
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,520
the exit is right over there.

684
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,370
Feel free to leave.

685
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:24,960
Your Highness.

686
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,820
Your Highness.

687
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,600
His Majesty ordered me and Prefect Zheng
to oversee the interrogation.

688
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,310
If he

689
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,000
dies under torture,

690
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,190
and His Majesty inquires about it,

691
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm afraid I would have to
report the truth.

692
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,560
Your Highness.

693
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,750
Wan Xi's heart and lungs
are already damaged.

694
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,500
I'm afraid he won't survive another round.

695
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,360
Send Wan Xi back to Fengyi Palace.

696
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,960
Whether to save him or not

697
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,400
is entirely up to Her Majesty.

698
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,530
Yes, Your Highness.

699
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,780
[Funing Palace]

700
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,370
Ze.

701
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,650
Please let my grandma win this time.

702
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,650
If she loses,

703
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,650
she'll make me practice Go
with her again.

704
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,170
Don't you mock me.

705
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,600
My Go skills
have improved greatly lately.

706
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,460
I've beaten His Majesty
three times in a row.

707
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,890
I'm about to win this game.

708
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,850
Grand Princess,

709
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,370
you actually beat His Majesty?

710
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,970
His Majesty is a master of Go.

711
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,650
Before I went out to seek a doctor,

712
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,960
I played Go with His Majesty

713
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,290
and never won even once.

714
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,370
His Majesty is busy with court affairs.

715
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,940
Not to mention playing Go,

716
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,110
he hasn't had

717
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,180
any leisure time these years.

718
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,920
His Majesty is diligent in his governance.

719
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,250
It's truly exhausting.

720
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,120
Please.

721
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,380
Little Wan'er, come here.

722
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,600
If my grandma wins this Go game,

723
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
she'll give us some rewards.

724
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

725
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,440
Grandma.

726
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,860
Why are you here alone?

727
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,730
Didn't Chi come with you?

728
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,560
He...

729
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,070
He asked me to come
check Your Majesty's pulse.

730
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,370
Chi is always so thoughtful.

731
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,440
I'm feeling tired anyway.

732
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,810
You can continue

733
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,770
this Go game another day.

734
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:24,960
Indeed.

735
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,170
We've been bothering you for too long.

736
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:27,960
Wan.

737
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,090
After checking her pulse,
let Sister-in-law rest well.

738
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,790
Ning, let's go.

739
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,450
See Grand Princess out.

740
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,250
Yes.

741
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,290
What is it?

742
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,410
Nothing too serious.

743
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,040
It's just Yan Chi and I have
some questions about the Song Xiwen case,

744
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,900
on which we would like your guidance,
Your Majesty.

745
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,730
Song Xiwen?

746
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,890
Is Song Xiwen that guard
from Prince Jin's residence?

747
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,560
Yes.

748
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,690
An attendant from
the Imperial Punishment Department

749
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,650
confessed that it was Wan Xi,
the Empress's personal attendant,

750
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,050
who took Song Xiwen away.

751
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,520
Therefore, Prince Cheng arrested Wan Xi

752
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,890
and tortured him severely,

753
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,690
but he didn't confess anything.

754
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,460
Wan Xi once served me in the palace.

755
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,680
He's extremely loyal,

756
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,200
but also very stubborn.

757
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,170
If he doesn't want to talk,

758
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,650
no one can make him.

759
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,560
But there's no smoke without fire.

760
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,330
For this attendant
to specifically bring Wan Xi's name up,

761
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,790
even if he said nothing,

762
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,690
there must be some connection.

763
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,690
Since it involves Prince Jin,

764
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,220
Yan Chi is quite concerned.

765
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,560
Chi always refuses to believe

766
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,730
that Prince Jin would do such a thing.

767
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,440
So he wants to find out

768
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,370
what exactly happened that night.

769
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,220
Prince Jin is a good boy
and a good brother.

770
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,090
Among all the princes,
he's closest to Chi.

771
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,400
Make sure to investigate this case
thoroughly,

772
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,920
so that we can give Prince Jin
an explanation.

773
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,380
Whatever you want to know,

774
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,980
I'll tell you everything.

775
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,290
Years ago,

776
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,610
I heard that Wan Xi adopted

777
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,870
a godson

778
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,330
named Wang Han in the Imperial Guard,

779
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,960
who earned Wan Xi's complete trust.

780
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,670
Master.

781
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,290
To catch this guy,

782
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,960
it took several of our men to tie him up.

783
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,020
Who is your master?

784
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,170
Who are you people?

785
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,110
Why is he so terrified?

786
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,300
I hear a woman's voice.

787
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,400
Are you from the palace?

788
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:24,950
I...

789
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,700
I won't betray Her Majesty!

790
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,710
I don't want the money or

791
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,960
my position in the Imperial Guard anymore!

792
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Please, let me go!

793
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
And let... Let...

794
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,770
Let my family go!

795
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,400
Don't let him talk nonsense.

796
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,960
Gag him and bury him now.

797
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,210
Yes.

798
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,920
No, please don't!

799
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,700
I... I...

800
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,780
Stop talking nonsense here. Shut up!

801
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,380
Don't worry, Madam.

802
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,590
Once this pit is dug,

803
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,040
we'll make sure he dies

804
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,400
without a sound.

805
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,030
As you command.

806
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,210
You fool.

807
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,580
Did you really think
you'd make it out alive?

808
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,060
Her Majesty already said

809
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,430
you shouldn't be left any way
to survive.

810
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,600
Don't run! Stop right there!

811
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,810
Stop right there!

812
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,600
Stop!

813
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,170
Don't run!

814
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,250
Help!
Someone's trying to kill and silence me!

815
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,390
Help!

816
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,560
Sir, please help me!

817
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,480
Gentler, okay?

818
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,730
Sir, they're trying to kill
and silence me!

819
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,400
Help me, Sir!
