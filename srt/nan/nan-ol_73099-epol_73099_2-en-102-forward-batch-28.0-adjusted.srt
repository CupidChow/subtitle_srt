Sect Leader,

5
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,870
although no outsiders were found

6
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,240
in Li Qingyue's room,

7
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,150
there were signs of someone else
having stayed there.

[Shangguan Riyue]

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,750
Aren't these clothes the best evidence?

10
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,640
Earlier, when Li Qingyue was getting food,

11
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,710
I noticed something was amiss.

12
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,000
And then I saw with my own eyes

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,070
that there was a strange man in her room.

14
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,590
This person must be hiding
somewhere in our sect.

15
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,280
With such sneaky behavior,

16
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,919
he surely isn't from any respectable sect.

17
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,480
Master.

18
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,240
I have worked with Li Qingyue
for three years.

19
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,700
I know her character well.

20
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,110
There must be some misunderstanding here.

24
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,120
whose disciple is she?

25
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,150
Li Qingyue is a disciple under
Master Qing Yang.

26
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
She has been in our sect for 11 years.

27
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,520
Order the entire sect to be on high alert.

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
We must find the outsider.

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,300
I understand, Master.

Zhang Suan.

31
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,280
You've volunteered to guard
the mountain gate for three years now.

32
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,480
It's time for you to come back, isn't it?

33
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,340
I previously damaged my foundation,
and my qihai was completely destroyed.

34
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,570
Being able to guard the mountain gate
is enough for me.

35
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,470
I dare not trouble you

36
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,020
any further, Master.

37
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,170
Look at him.

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
What a cruel joke fate has played.

39
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,260
Why are you here?

40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,579
I am here to see you.

41
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,140
Where were you last night?

42
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,870
They didn't manage to find you?

43
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,910
You said it yourself.

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,210
I must not be seen by others.

45
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,610
Things have changed since.

46
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,760
Now, they are accusing me of
hiding a demonic cultivator.

47
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,090
Help me clear this up by stepping forward.

48
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,050
I was the one who proposed to you.

49
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,780
They won't give you a hard time.

50
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,510
Even if they accuse me of
caring only about love,

51
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,110
it's still much better than
being accused of betraying the sect.

52
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,700
Have you ever thought

53
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,310
what if I am indeed a demonic cultivator?

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,650
What do you mean?

55
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,530
Before proposing to someone,

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,830
don't you think it's only right to ask

57
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,090
about their identity?

58
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,480
Are you also from Yinlian Sect?

59
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,730
I'm sorry, I can't be
responsible for you anymore.

Senior Meng is a cautionary tale for me.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,930
So I can't follow in his footsteps.

62
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,920
The betrothal gifts I gave you earlier,

63
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,520
consider them as my apology.

64
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
You should go.

65
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,020
Do you really want me to leave?

can't work together.

I acknowledge the debt I owe you
for saving my life before.

[May your spirit shine across all realms]

I was previously saved by him.

79
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,280
Seeing he had nowhere to go,
I felt sorry for him

80
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,880
and took him in for a few days.

81
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,600
He has now left the sect.

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,120
What is his name and which sect is he from?

83
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,080
Junior Li, if what you'd said is true,

84
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,960
then tell us that person's name.

85
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,080
It would help clear up any misunderstandings
when we investigate later.

What's wrong?

87
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,180
Is he from a demonic sect?

88
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,430
Although he is from Yinlian Sect,

89
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,430
he saved my life.

90
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,510
I saw that he did no evil,

91
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,390
so I thought he might not be...

92
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,000
Absurd!

93
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,920
Since you knew he was from Yinlian Sect,

94
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,270
how dare you took him in?

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,720
I had only just realized his identity.

96
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,240

97
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,190
Didn't you say he had already left the sect?

Speak!

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,390
Who exactly is he?

102
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,270
I'm not sure either.

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,659
I only know his name is Bai Jiusi.

104
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,740
What... did you say his name was?

105
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,630
Bai Jiusi.

106
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,780
Nonsense! Utter nonsense!

107
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,520
How did you come to know the sacred name
of Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

108

Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

109
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,560
Impossible. He said he was...

Enough!

Meng Chu may have gone astray,
but at least he owns up to what he’s done.

And instead, you are keeping up with your lies.

The sect taught you to
speak and act with dignity and virtue.

Yet, you haven't learned a thing.

I'm telling the truth, Master.

116

Take her away.

117
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,430
Continue searching for
the demonic cultivator within the sect.

118

[May your spirit shine across all realms]

Sect Leader!

126
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,550
The sect's conduct has become
more improper in recent times.

127
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,230
To think we now have
deceitful individuals among us.

128
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,140
Looks like it’s time for me
to restore order to the sect.

129
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,600
Yes, Sect Leader.

130
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,790
Do you know what Li Qingyue said?

131
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,270
-What did she say?
-What did she say?

132
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,410
She said the person she hid is called Bai Jiusi.

133
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,480
Bai Jiusi.

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,740
I've asked around.

135
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,270
That's the sacred name of Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

136
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,450
Do you know who Heavenly Lord Dacheng is?

137
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,960
He's one of the divine beings from Nine Heavens.

138
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,550
A divine being?

139
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,600
How could low-ranking disciples like us

140
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,190
ever hope to see someone like that?

141
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,090
In my opinion, even the Sect Leader

142
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,010
might not have seen his true face.

143
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,810
Li Qingyue is just a mere gatekeeper,

144
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,350
yet she has the nerve to lie so outrageously.

145
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,370
She should take a look at her own pitiful state.

146
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,460
I won't even dare to dream of doing that.

147
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,940
As disciples of Jingyun Sect,

148
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,980
we should repent if we make mistakes.

149
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,930
But if one's full of lies,

150
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,270
they should be expelled from the sect.

151
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,490
If you ask me,

152
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,720
this Li Qingyue must have fallen for

153
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,810
some low-class demonic cultivator.

154
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,630
But because it's too shameful to admit,

155
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,030
she's trying to throw mud

156
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,950
at Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

157
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,940
This way, there's no way
Sect Leader can investigate.

158
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,960
-What's going on?
-What's wrong?

159
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,290
-Slowly.
-Take it easy.

160
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,870
Let's eat, let's eat.

161
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,490
Senior Zhang, where are you going?

162
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,670
Didn't Master ask all disciples

163
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,470
to gather at Ascension Terrace?

164
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,330
But I can't let you go.

165
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,250
What do you mean?

166
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,280
If I let you go today,

167
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,160
then the ones expelled from the sect...

168
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,360
will be more than just Junior Li.

169
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,740
You want to stop me?

170
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,950
Yes.

171
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,580
Then try me.

172
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,450
If this was three years ago,
I certainly couldn't beat you.

173
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,180
But now, Senior Zhang, you should be aware that

174
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,620
you're no match for me.

175
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,810
Back then, you and I entered the sect together.

176
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,560
I'm grateful for your care.

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,410
So today, I cannot stand by and
watch you make a mistake.

178
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,740
Li Qingyue, as a disciple of Jingyun Sect,

179
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,710
you should reject evil and uphold integrity.

180
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,460
If you're willing to reveal the real identity

181
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,030
of this demonic cultivator,

182
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,120
I will give you a chance

183
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,150
to repent and redeem yourself today.

184
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,780
Sect Leader, I've truly told you everything.

185
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,870
There's not a single lie in my words.

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,190
If that's the case,

187
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,880
then Jingyun Sect can no longer keep you.

188
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,520
All the Taoist knowledge you possess

189
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,380
was learned here at Jingyun Sect.

190
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,550
To prevent you from straying onto an evil path in the future,

191
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,670
I will strip you of your cultivation today

192
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,240
and expel you from the sect.

193
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
From now on, whether you live or die

194
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,180
has nothing to do with Jingyun Sect.

195
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,320
Is telling the truth also a mistake?

196
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
Senior Meng is still imprisoned,

197
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,450
so why should I be expelled?

198
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,150
One must be trustworthy in conduct
and act with integrity.

199
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,010
You don't even understand these basic principles.

200
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,760
All disciples, heed my command.

201
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Let this be a warning for the future.

202
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,470
Didn't I tell you to leave?

203
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,300
Why did you come back?

204
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,850
So you're that demonic cultivator.

205
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,370
How dare you!

206
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,030
Yun!

207
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,660
Everyone, form the formation!

208
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,190
[Xuan Wei]

209
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,620
Master Xuan Wei, why have you
come out of seclusion?

210
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,560
If I hadn't come out, you guys
would've offended the divine race.

211
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,760
I, Xuan Wei from Jingyun Sect,

212
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,700
pay my respect to Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

213
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,770
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

214
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,490
Is he really Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

215
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,290
I came out of seclusion after sensing
the Heavenly Lord's spiritual energy.

216
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,200
This is a sudden visit.

217
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,590
May I ask what brought you here, My Lord?

218
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,100
I've come to find

219
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,280
my spiritual partner.

220
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,240
She's awake, she's awake!

221
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,480
Hurry, hurry!

222
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,190
She's finally awake!

223
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,180
Look!

224
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,390
I've brought you some fruit.

225
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,910
Qingyue, are you feeling better?

226
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,840
I've brought you some tonics.

227
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,360
I brought them specially from my hometown.

228
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,340
Are you hungry? I brought you
some delicious food.

229
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,470
If there's anything else you want,
I'll go get it for you.

230
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,870
What's wrong with all of you?

231
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,150
Move aside, move aside, move aside!

232
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,670
Move aside, move aside, move aside!

233
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,080
All of you just know how to
flatter the powerful and bully the weak.

234
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,150
Here, Junior Li.

235
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,270
You must be thirsty after sleeping for so long.

236
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,670
Try this tea I've specially brewed for you.

237
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,040
It's fragrant and aromatic.

238
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,720
Here.

239
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,230
Junior Li, you are the person who knows me best.

240
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,270
You should know that

241
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,120
I always focus on the issue, not the person.

242
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,790
If I've offended you in any way before,

243
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,070
it was definitely for the sake of the sect.

244
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,600
Junior Li, you are the kind to
see the bigger picture.

245
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,250
You surely won't hold it against me, right?

246
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,270
Just think about it.
When you were injured previously,

247
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,800
I even went to guard the mountain gate for you.

248
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,250
If I had known things would turn out this way,

249
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,110
I wouldn't have stopped you then.

250
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,090
I took that hit for nothing.

251
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,150
Come, come, let's tuck you in nicely.

252
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,550
Let's tuck you in nicely.

253
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,860
It's easiest to catch a cold at this time.

254
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,520
Here.

255
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,730
Qingyue needs to be resting up now.

256
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,990
Junior Li, the Sect Leader requests
your presence.

257
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,670
-Yes.
-Yes.

258
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:36,770
Junior Li!

259
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,369
When you rise to wealth and power,
don't forget about us.

260
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,579
How great.

261
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:56,680
Disciple Li Qingyue
pays respects to the Sect Leader.

262
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,080
Greetings to all elders—

263
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,850
Why are you here?

264
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,230
Li Qingyue.

265
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,690
Don't be disrespectful in front of
Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

266
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,180
H-H...

267
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,300
Are you really Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

268
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,830
My Lord, is it really her?

269
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,250
That's right.

270
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,460
My Lord, you really know
how to pick the right people.

271
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,670
This child has been in
our Jingyun Sect for over 10 years.

272
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,220
She's the most considerate and sensible.

273
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,270
She understands the bigger picture
and is sensible.

274
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,430
She is also quick-witted, knowledgeable,
and richly talented.

275
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,160
Her aptitude is also excellent.

276
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,090
Although her cultivation level isn't high,
she has solid foundation.

277
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,350
Most precious of all,

278
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,020
she is loyal and has a heart of gratitude.

279
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,870
She speaks with care, acts with caution,
and stays humble.

280
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,860
She's a role model for
the 3000 disciples of our sect.

281
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,790
M-Me?

282
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,590
Look at that modesty.

283
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
This is just one of her many virtues.

284
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,790
I've been in seclusion for over 200 years.

285
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,390
To encounter such a joyous matter upon my exit

286
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,640
is also a blessing for our sect.

287
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,070
My Lord, may I ask if you have
any orders regarding this marriage?

288
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,210
Marriage?

289
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,450
I have already accepted her betrothal gifts.

290
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,240
The rest is up to you.

291
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,160
My Lord, then when do you think would be

292
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,800
a good date for the wedding?

293
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,860
Like I said,

294
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,440
it's up to you.

295
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,360
Whose marriage are we talking about?

296
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,940
Who else in this hall could be getting married?

297
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,590
Many matters await me at Canglei Palace.
I'll take my leave.

298
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,210
Wait!

299
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,740
I still have questions.

300
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,310
Li Qingyue, how many years
have you been in our sect?

301
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,310
It's been 11 years.

302
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,220
Then before you joined the sect,

303
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,910
who were your parents and where did you live?

304
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,210
I have lived at the foot of
Yufan Mountain since birth.

305
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,170
My father was a woodcutter.

306
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,350
My mother was an ordinary farm worker.

307
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,480
My master, Master Qing Yang, got drunk

308
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,270
and accidentally entered Miasma Forest.

309
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,930
It was my father who saved her.

310
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,260
To repay his kindness,

311
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,350
my Master took me in as her disciple.

312
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,010
Where are your parents now?

313
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
They have both passed away.

314
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,590
Are you sure your father

315
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,650
was just an ordinary woodcutter?

316
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,920
Perhaps

317
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,380
he was a powerful cultivator

318
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,540
and is currently living in seclusion
in the mountains?

319
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,950
But he got into a fight with a villager

320
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,030
and died from a head injury.

321
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,280
Done with the questioning?

322
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,590
Senior Zhang, why are you here?

323
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,160
Master Dan Yang said

324
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,510
I must stay by your side at all times from now on

325
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,770
to ensure your safety.

326
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,200
There's no need.

327
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,110
What danger could there be within the sect?

328
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,640
How can it not be dangerous?

329
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,530
For all we know, someone could be
secretly hiding an outsider.

330
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,830
Senior, I didn't mean to hide it from you.

331
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,070
-I couldn't find a chance to tell you...
-Qingyue.

332
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,230
So in the past few days...

333
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,760
you guys were living together?

334
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,240
That day when you asked me
about the betrothal gifts,

335
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,560
it was for him, right?

336
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,470
Yes, it was.

337
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,470
Do you... really like him?

338
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,840
He's so handsome.

339
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,340
And he saved my life.

340
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,180
I have no reason not to like him.

341
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,770
Alright.

342
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,640
Zi Yang.

343
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm here.

344
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,030
Li Qingyue's parents passed away early.

345
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,640
Her only close relative left is her Master.

346
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,540
Qing Yang must be present on her wedding day.

347
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,840
Have you notified her?

348
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,070
I have already sent out an urgent order.

349
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Junior Qing Yang should have received the message
and is on her way back.

350
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,990
Our Jingyun Sect has been
established for 300 years.

351
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,830
When our sect's founder established the sect,

352
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,960
she passed down to her disciples
a single word: courage.

353
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,500
True courage comes from inner strength.

354
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,780
He who faces death with no fear,
pressing on with courage and bold resolve.

355
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,430
With benevolence in the heart,
courage naturally follows.

356
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,240
Without righteousness, chaos will surely arise.

357
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,100
Unafraid, untroubled, unwavering.

358
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,730
Such is the spirit and honor of our Jingyun Sect.

359
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,160
Master, your words are absolutely right.

360
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,790
Although Heavenly Lord Dacheng's status is noble,

361
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,270
we must not lose our spirit.

362
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,310
On the wedding day, we must remember,

363
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,510
"Do not be greedy, do not flatter, do not pander."

364
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,400
Though the divine race is superior,

365
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,480
Jingyun Sect must not lose our honor.

366
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,550
We understand.

367
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,150
Good. Now let's discuss the
wedding arrangements.

368
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,270
Senior,

369
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,400
what kind of bird is this exactly?

370
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,260
Why do we keep seeing it recently?

371
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,210
I don't know.

372
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,510
But it must be because Jingyun Sect
has good feng shui,

373
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,440
attracting it to linger around our sect.

374
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,030
That makes sense.
Our sect's feng shui is indeed excellent.

375
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,350
Isn't it?

376
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,510
Not to mention this white bird,

377
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,830
even Heavenly Lord Dacheng has been attracted here.

378
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,830
Lower your voice.

379
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,700
Arm length, 2 feet 1 inch.

380
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,940
Arm length, 2 feet 1 inch.

381
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,980
Junior Qingyue, let's measure your shoulders.

382
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,510
How did Heavenly Lord Dacheng...

383
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,180
come to fancy Li Qingyue?

384
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,270
This is even more surprising than
red rain falling from the sky.

385
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,960
Exactly.

386
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,420
Do you all really think...

387
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,980
Qingyue.

388
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,460
-Junior Li, there's space here.
-Qingyue.

389
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,530
Come, sit here.

390
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,020
Shut your eyes, quiet your mind;
hold steady, and focus your spirit.

391
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,450
Magnificent in presence,
as if cradling Mount Kulun itself.

392
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,610
Concentrate!

393
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,370
This is Jade Spirit Spring.

394
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,190
Its water is sourced from
the depths of Xiaoqiu Mountain.

395
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,510
It's rich with jade essence,
making it especially nourishing.

396
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,650
From today on, come here everyday
for a dip at this time.

397
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,930
It will be good for you.

398
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,350
These dishes

399
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,270
took a whole day to prepare.

400
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,310
So you must eat more later.

401
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,890
How could I eat so much?

402
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,910
Do you still think you're
the same Junior Li as before?

403
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Then who am I?

404
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,200
You are Heavenly Lord Dacheng's spiritual partner.

405
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,640
They call this the "Golden Turtle
Descends to the Sea" Pill.

406
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,510
It's made from cinnabar and moonstone,

407
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,370
supplemented with the shell of
a century-old Dongting black turtle.

408
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,030
Are all these for me?

409
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,260
These aren't for you.

410
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,530
But, all other pills in this pill room

411
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,770
are at your disposal.

412
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,730
[Qing Yang]

413
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,220
My good disciple!

414
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,320
Your Master has come to see you.

415
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,260
Did you miss me?

416
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,780
Come.

417
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,070
Take a sip.

418
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,000
Mingyue.

419
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,030
It's Qingyue.

420
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,320
How come this name is so similar to mine?

421
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,680
Master, you gave me this name.

422
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,070
You used to say that I had

423
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,960
a bit of your old flair when I was little.

424
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,490
So you bestowed upon me the character "Qing".

425
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,680
You're 19 years old this year, right?

426
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,030
Yes.

427
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,830
It's been a long time since
we've seen each other.

428
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,680
Do you have any doubts about
your cultivation?

429
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,160
Feel free to ask me anything.

430
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,640
When I was nine years old,

431
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,170
you said that as long as I
mastered the basics,

432
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
you would teach me magic.

433
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,810
And then?

434
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,960
Then I never saw you again, Master.

435
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,040
None of that matters now.

436
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,440
As your Master, I'm here to
ask you just one question.

437
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,350
Are you willing?

438
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,920
What?

439
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,920
Are you willing to marry Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

440
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,690
After all these days,

441
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,820
you're the only one who's asked me that, Master.

442
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,030
And... your answer is?

443
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,490
Sect Leader said Heavenly Lord Dacheng
is a true god from the celestial realm.

444
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,470
As human cultivators,

445
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,300
we may cast aside material desires
and sever worldly emotions,

446
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,900
diligently practice in these deep mountains,

447
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,960
all for the hope that one day
we can ascend to the celestial realm,

448
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,760
become immortals and gods,
and seek eternal life.

449
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,590
It's my great fortune to have
caught the eye of the Heavenly Lord.

450
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,000
This kind of chance comes once in an eternity.

451
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,070
Let alone becoming the
Heavenly Lord's spiritual partner,

452
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,590
even if I am simply tasked
to be his gatekeeper,

453
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,920
it's still an extremely rare opportunity

454
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,350
that living beings across all realms,

455
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,000
heaven and earth, would die for.

456
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,590
That's one way to put it.

457
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,550
But getting married is quite different
from being a gatekeeper, isn't it?

458
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,750
Even if you are a mortal,

459
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,950
there should be mutual consent, right?

460
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Moreover,

461
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,750
what exactly did Heavenly Lord Dacheng see in you?

462
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,310
I don't know.

463
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,920
Look, you are not naturally talented.

464
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,590
Even if you practice diligently,

465
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,470
I'm afraid there's not much
to hope for in this lifetime.

466
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,880
Just like any mortal, you will live in mediocrity
for a few decades,

467
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,810
only to wither away in the end
and return to the cycle of reincarnation.

468
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,160
Now, a heavenly opportunity has bestowed you

469
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,660
with the great fortune of
ascending to heaven in a single step.

470
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,310
But this might not necessarily be a blessing.

471
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,370
You should think about it carefully.

472
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,720
Bai Jiusi.

473
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,880
Are you still here?

474
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,070
Heavenly Lord Dacheng!

475
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,070
Bai Jiusi!

476
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,220
What's up with him?

477
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,790
So much for getting married when
he wouldn't even show up.

478
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,190
I still have lots of questions I want to ask.

479
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,760
What questions?

480
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,440
My Lord!

481
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,140
You're really still here.

482
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,270
Just passing by.

483
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,240
What a coincidence.

484
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,910
What questions did you want to ask just now?

485
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,290
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

486
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,550
I didn't know your identity before,

487
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,350
which led to my disrespectful behavior.

488
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,350
So... why did you choose me
as your spiritual partner?

489
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,360
I thought you were aware.

490
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,680
So...

491
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,810
you like me too, right?

492
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,110
I like you too?

493
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,710
Yes, because I like you.

494
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,170
So you like me too.

495
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,960
I accepted your betrothal gift.

496
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,440
Naturally, I can't break the engagement.

497
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,080
Then why did you accept it?

498
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,200
You gave it to me.

499
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,900
So if we cut to the chase,

500
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,190
it means that you like me too, right?

501
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,670
You have too many questions.

502
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,860
What? I've just started asking.

503
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,270
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, I know you like me too!

504
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,010
I will be a good spiritual partner to you!

505
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,560
Qingyue.

506
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,680
Senior Lyu!

507
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,050
You've been released too?

508
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,780
My Master pleaded with the Sect Leader
on my behalf.

509
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,270
Qingyue.

510
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,400
I...

511
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,400
What are you doing?

512
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,510
Senior Meng didn't commit any major mistake.

513
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,510
He's chivalrous and kind-hearted.

514
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,350
The Sect Leader has ordered him

515
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,590
to be imprisoned in the Hall of Penance
to repent for life.

516
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,390
I hope you can save him, Qingyue.

517
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,740
Please get up first.

518
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,000
I've heard a lot of rumours

519
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,460
about Senior Lyu and Senior Meng.

520
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,640
They all say both of you are the most oustanding

521
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,370
disciples in our Jingyun Sect.

522
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,100
You roam the world, slaying demons
and evil spirits,

523
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,200
and are known for your kindness.

524
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,200
But Senior,

525
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,920
why is it that

526
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,510
you guys are kind and helpful to

527
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,710
the reformed juniors of the Demon Sect,

528
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,750
but so cold and indifferent
to your fellow disciples?

529
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,480
That day when I was injured
and urgently needed medicine,

530
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,790
I came to you for help.

531
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,870
Do you remember, Senior Lyu?

532
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,790
Also,

533
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,360
that day when you fled with Senior Meng,

534
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,810
did you really think I could help you,

535
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,080
or did you just want me
to help share the blame?

536
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,620
Qingyue, I was in a panic that day.

537
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,000
If you must hold a grudge, hold it against me.

538
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,330
Don't hold it against Senior Meng. He—

539
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,030
Senior.

540
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,449
I don't have a grudge against you.

541
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,420
I just want to tell you that

542
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,489
you may have your reasons,

543
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,210
but I also have my principles.

544
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,670
Whether it's cultivating immortality
or practicing chivalry,

545
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,070
it's all about cultivating one's character,
not creating legends.

546
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,590
What one truly cares about,
one will never regret, even in death.

547
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,360
What one doesn't care about,
it will never matter even in life or death.

548
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,920
Qingyue—

549
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,190
Senior, you are the personal disciple of
Master Dan Yang.

550
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,790
Master Dan Yang has high expectations for you.

551
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,840
To cultivate immortality is to cultivate the Dao.

552
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,969
Senior Meng has his own path to the Dao.

553
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,550
Then Senior, what is your path to the Dao?

554
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,400
Stop looking.

555
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,000
Who in this world would dare steal
someone from Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

556
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,320
Why are you following me?

557
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,960
Of course I'm afraid you might do something foolish.

558
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,350
These days,

559
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,140
there's more than enough chaos in Jingyun Sect.

560
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,580
Why are you so guarded against me?

561
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,790
You know it yourself.

562
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,770
Now, I can't even win the most ordinary disciple

563
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,810
of Jingyun Sect.

564
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,280
No matter what,

565
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,370
you've been my senior since I joined the sect.

566
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,150
So you'll always be my senior.

567
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
Junior Li?

568
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,140
Why deceive me?

569
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Senior Zhang?

570
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,070
Senior, I have something to tell you.

571
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,560
Have a good chat.

572
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,110
Senior, you were exceptionally talented in
both techniques and spells.

573
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,770
You were a man of great talent.

574
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,670
But due to an accident, you got injured
and damaged your foundation.

575
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,190
Since then, you've been unable to recover.

576
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,440
Guarding the gate with someone like me
for three years,

577
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
you must have felt frustrated, right?

578
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,230
No.

579
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,360
Every day I spent guarding the gate with you

580
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,280
was, for me,

581
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,230
a great joy.

582
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,570
That's good.

583
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,800
I've been worried that

584
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,200
I might have caused you trouble in the past.

585
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,440
These are all medicine that I had

586
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,030
specially picked out from the pill room.

587
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,360
Although it might not be able to

588
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,070
fully heal your damaged foundation,

589
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,190
they can still enhance your magical powers.

590
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,320
Thank you for taking care of me
all these years, Senior Meng.

591
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,520
Now that I'm leaving,

592
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,110
please accept these as a token of my gratitude.

593
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,310
No need for all these.

594
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,480
All these years, your presence in Jingyun Sect

595
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,540
has been rather...

596
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,600
insignificant.

597
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,540
Though you're now going to Nine Heavens,

598
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,120
I can't tell if this is for the better or worse.

599
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,980
Please take care of yourself.

600
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,570
Don't worry, Senior.

601
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,360
I might be overlooked here,

602
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,880
but when I am in heaven,
I am sure I wouldn't be.

603
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,800
Here, take it. Take it.

604
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,150
The path of immortality is vast,
and the journey of life is long.

605
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,110
Senior, till we meet again.

606
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,090
Are you really not afraid?

607
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,300
Regardless for better or for worst,
I am not afraid.

608
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,850
Not bad at all.

609
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,330
As expected of my disciple.

610
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,110
The time has come.

611
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,320
Qingyue.

612
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
This sword was bestowed upon me
by my Master years ago.

613
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,330
It has been safeguarded by
previous Sect Leaders of Jingyun Sect.

614
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,800
Today, I bestow it upon you.

615
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,280
You are the first person from our 12 provinces

616
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,280
to ascend to the Nine Heavens as a mortal.

617
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,970
You must remember, the Dao
is the origin of all change.

618
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,670
The Dao moves in harmony with nature.
To do nothing is to do something.

619
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,370
As cultivators,

620
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,760
we seek to understand the universe
and search for the laws of fate.

621
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,290
The path to pursue is none other than your own.

622
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,110
Gods have their way, humans have theirs.

623
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,670
A righteous heart will lead you
onto a righteous path.

624
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,960
Even if heaven and earth collapse,
evil cannot overcome righteousness.

625
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,280
Believe in yourself, and you will succeed.

626
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,470
I will remember, Master.

627
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,320
Go now.
