There is a difference.

Hua Ruyue,

every being in the world has its destiny.

Reckless interference

will bring you serious trouble.

17
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,000
Why do divine beings go
through tribulations here?

18
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,120
Because there's too much
suffering in the mortal realm.

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,710
Mortals are faced with
problems at all ages,

20
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,190
like separation, hatred
and unattainable longing.

21
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,240
Even if they try their best,

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,010
they are bound to have
regrets about some things.

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,079
Divine beings have spiritual energy

24
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,480
and the ability to control mortals' lives.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,360
If all divine beings
empathize with mortals,

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,910
they can't refrain from
interfering with heaven's will

27
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,440
with their power, can they?

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,800
But won't that be to
the detriment of heaven's order,

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,860
the mortal realm and
the divine race?

30

Hua Ruyue, you've set
off on this dangerous path.

31
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,360
I promise I won't do it again.

32

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,850
Master,

170
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,240
I need to finish an important mission.

171
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,700
About the Drought Dragon?

172
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,500
Yes.

173
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,030
Pardon me for the rejection.

174
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,750
Goodbye, Master.

175
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,190
See you later.

176
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,370
Meng Changqin!

177
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,040
Can't you just give up?

178
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,630
Since I'm your master,

179
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,920
I'll do my best to protect you.

180
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,750
Just come with me.

181
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,240
I'll find you a job,

182
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,000
so you can make a living.

183
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,950
Instead of toiling and moiling,

184
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,670
you can live a stable life.

185
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,790
Master, I'm having a good enough life now.

186
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,400
Does "good" refer to

187
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,550
bustling about and endangering your life?

188
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,430
Master, you don't understand.

189
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,330
Since the day I was born,

190
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,840
droughts have happened every year,

191
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,970
with no end in sight.

192
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,910
I saw people starve to death
in this messed-up world.

193
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,620
That's why I chose to become an official.

194
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,780
I once worshipped the gods,

195
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,080
putting all my trust in them.

196
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,140
But then I realized

197
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:04,000
that officials and gods
couldn't be of help.

198
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,150
People need to have faith
in something, right?

199
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,030
So, now, I believe in myself.

200
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,320
Master,

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,360
save that housekeeper job for me.

202
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,990
After I slay the Drought Dragon,

203
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,920
I'll come to you.

204
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,250
What if you can never
find the Drought Dragon?

205
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,050
In that case,

206
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,630
I'll have to see you
again in my next life.

207
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,850
You can also believe in me.

208
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,360
What?

209
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,240
Trust me.

210
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,380
I'll help you slay the Drought Dragon.

211
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,510
This is Mount Wuju,

212
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,130
where the Drought Dragon resides.

213
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,270
Will the droughts be ended

214
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,790
if I kill the dragon?

215
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,950
The Drought Dragon is driven

216
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,640
by its nature to disturb the mortal realm.

217
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,670
Perhaps it doesn't mean to cause droughts.

218
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,740
Maybe it doesn't have to die.

219
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,570
What else can we do?

220
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,870
Chishui River purges all evil.

221
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,320
It can neutralize
the Drought Dragon's dryness.

222
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
If the dragon agrees to go back
to the north of Chishui River

223
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,210
and stop harming the mortal realm,

224
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,810
then we won't have to kill it.

225
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,360
But what if it disagrees?

226
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,480
Then we'll slay it without mercy.

227
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,790
Go!

228
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,480
Master.

229
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,990
Divine Lord Siling?

230
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,030
Droughts have prevailed
and taken many lives.

231
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,930
You are responsible for it.

232
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,760
If there is a shred of sympathy in you,

233
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,350
you should go back to Chishui River now

234
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,280
and stop harming the mortal realm.

235
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,110
I made a huge contribution by
quelling the water demon unrest

236
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,510
in the North Sea.

237
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,030
The celestial realm rewarded me

238
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,800
with the privilege
to travel the Three Realms

239
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,630
with no restraint.

240
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,860
I'm afraid I can't follow your command.

241
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Your freedom must

242
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,270
make way for the wellbeing
of the Three Realms.

243
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,350
The Three Realms?

244
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,400
You're only talking about humans.

245
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,710
Just like fallen leaves
and withered flowers,

246
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,720
their lives

247
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,440
don't matter at all, do they?

248
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,590
I thought you weren't
aware you were doing evil.

249
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,590
But in fact, you're knowingly
doing it without remorse.

250
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,480
In that case,

251
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,770
your life must be ended.

252
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,270
Master!

253
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,080
Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

254
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,720
Heavenly Emissary.

255
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,550
Is there a decree from the Empyrean?

256
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,290
You're adventuring with Siling
in the mortal realm.

257
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,350
Do you know what she is up to right now?

258
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
She is trying to kill a divine being.

259
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,590
Things form, exist, decay and vanish.

260
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,070
The circle of life never ceases to be.

261
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,470
That's the law of heaven.

262
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,870
Now, by attempting
to slay the Drought Dragon.

263
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,740
she's not only committing
the crime of killing a divine being,

264
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,870
but also obstructing the cycle of life

265
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,830
and breaching the law of heaven.

266
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,020
You came here with her.

267
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,400
You must do something
when she makes a terrible mistake.

268
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,640
What do you want me to do?

269
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,420
To stop her and to bring her
back to the Empyrean for punishment.

270
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,830
Master!

271
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,110
Master!

272
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,350
Master, it's dying.

273
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,770
Go. Kill it now.

274
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,240
Got it.

275
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,880
Hua Ruyue, how dare you
kill a divine being?

276
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,370
It should be punished by the heaven

277
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,220
for the crimes it may have committed,

278
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,350
instead of you.

279
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,530
What did the heaven do
when droughts happened?

280
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,300
What did the heaven do
when people starved to death?

281
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,510
If the heaven is as merciless
as you make it sound to be,

282
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,590
why not defy it?

283
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,680
Master!

284
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,290
Meng Changqin, what are you waiting for?

285
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,830
Both mortals

286
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,310
and divine beings

287
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,200
must obey the heaven!

288
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,830
Master, I'm unable to kill it!

289
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,920
Changqin, this is a justifiable killing.

290
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,110
Believe in yourself, and you'll succeed!

291
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,540
As a divine being, you're
harming the mortal realm.

292
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,740
If all divine beings are like you,

293
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
mortals have every right to kill them!

294
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,310
Finally... I did it!

295
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,440
Bai Jiusi, where is Meng Changqin?

296
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,310
He's in a coma, but he's fine.

297
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,550
Good.

298
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,520
I'm relieved.

299
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,130
You know what?
We slayed the Drought Dragon today

300
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,770
and ended the droughts.

301
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,400
From now on, people won't starve anymore.

302
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,550
I know.

303
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,750
Do you think I did wrong?

304
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,240
Yes.

305
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,310
Why?

306
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,160
I offered you my advice,

307
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,240
but you didn't heed my words.

308
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,600
You said mortals were as insignificant

309
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,440
as ordinary animals.

310
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,960
But that is not true.

311
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,270
I saw Meng Chi

312
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,650
creating colorful paintings,

313
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,920
though he was born

314
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,440
color-blind.

315
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,160
I saw Meng Changqin,

316
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,790
a mortal though he is,

317
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,640
slaying the Drought Dragon
with a blunt blade.

318
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,590
Even divine beings can't achieve these.

319
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,440
So what?

320
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,370
"So what"?

321
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,920
Bai Jiusi, do you know what you're saying?

322
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,050
I'm always clear about what I'm doing.

323
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,490
You're the one who is not of

324
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,110
sound mind.

325
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,270
We came to the mortal realm

326
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,200
to overcome the love tribulation.

327
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,240
I told you

328
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,440
not to recklessly use your power here

329
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,840
and not to cause trouble.

330
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,330
But what have you done?

331
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,550
You've used your power
to save lives several times.

332
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,590
You even killed
the Drought Dragon for mortals!

333
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,790
The dragon was at fault!

334
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,990
Right and wrong can't be easily judged.

335
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,900
I only care about the results.

336
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,200
Hua Ruyue, you promised
that helping Meng Changqin

337
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,480
was an one-off thing,

338
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,510
which made me agree to pass
the love tribulation with you.

339
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,030
But now you've broken your promise.

340
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,750
You've violated the heaven's rules.

341
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,520
I can't be tolerant of you anymore.

342
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,880
What are you going to do?

343
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm going back.

344
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,680
What did you say?

345
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,740
I'm going back to the Nine Heavens

346
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,240
to atone for my sin of coming to
the mortal realm without permission.

347
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,770
You're going to kill me?

348
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,440
No, I'm not.

349
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,260
But I'll seal the spiritual energy in you

350
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,520
to show the Heavenly
Emissary what stance I take.

351
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,750
I have nothing to do with

352
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
what you've done.

353
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,920
Bai Jiusi!

354
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
You like mortals, don't you?

355
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,440
Your spiritual energy
will be sealed for ten years,

356
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,040
so you have to live as
a mortal here for a decade.

357
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,400
Meanwhile,

358
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,350
I can go back to
the Nine Heavens, all innocent.

359
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,850
This is the best for us.

360
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,690
You can't do this to me.

361
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,010
You can't do this to me.

362
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,640
I thought

363
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,160
you truly loved me
during the several decades

364
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,920
we spent together in the mortal realm.

365
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
But as it turns out,

366
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,920
that was all a delusion.

367
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,830
You're actually

368
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,880
heartless and selfish!

369
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,570
Now I understand...

370
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,640
It's no wonder that you don't

371
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,100
want to have a baby with me,

372
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,400
and that you've never helped me!

373
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,860
Am I also an insignificant

374
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,720
being in your eyes?

375
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,880
You're sweet and nice when you need me.

376
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,280
But you would discard me instantly

377
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,170
when I go against your interests!

378
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,220
I did give you options.

379
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,240
And this is the one you chose.

380
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,880
It will be over soon.

381
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,790
You won't be in pain for long.

382
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,350
No...

383
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,880
Let go of me!

384
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,400
Let go!

Master Qing Yang,

403
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,240
Do you really not know anything?

404
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,070
Why did Master Xuan Wei, the Sect Leader

405
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,440
and others suddenly head to and come back

406
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,700
from the Nine Heavens?

407
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,200
How am I supposed to know why?

408
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
It makes sense for disciples
not having the answer.

409
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
But, Master, you hold
an important position.

410
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,830
How could you not know the truth?

411
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,270
-That's right.
-That's right.

412
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,240
Zip it, lad!

413
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,350
Senior Zhang?

414
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,480
Senior Zhang, you're back.

415
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,370
When did you come back?

416
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,880
In the early morning.

417
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,240
Early morning?

418
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,270
That is to say,

419
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,210
you returned with
the Sect Leader and the others.

420
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,400
Do you know what Master Xuan Wei

421
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,160
and the Sect Leader went

422
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,400
to the Nine Heavens for?

423
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,480
Yeah. The fellows we hang out with

424
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,590
suddenly changed.

425
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,710
Their power became stronger,

426
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,800
and their demeanor
and temperament different!

427
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,630
Senior Zhang, did the Sect Leader

428
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,440
feed them magical

429
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,969
pills or elixirs in secret?

430
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,210
I don't know.

431
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,639
What? You're highly valued by the sect.

432
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,920
How can you not know?

433
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,320
Everyone here is
a top disciple of the sect.

434
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,030
Except me.

435
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,070
Yes, except you.

436
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,070
Those who went up

437
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,360
are small-time outer-circle disciples,

438
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,550
including cleaners and food servers.

439
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,710
Indeed.

440
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,880
Yeah.

441
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,550
Right.

442
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,150
The Heaven-Turning Seal
contains immense power.

443
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,880
It broke and left no trail.

444
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,840
It could be in the Empyrean, the Hell,

445
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,760
the Three Realms, the Six Paths,
the Eight Desolations

446
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,190
or the Four Seas.

447
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,360
Just because we can't find it

448
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,920
doesn't mean those
in Canglei Palace can't.

449
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,280
Long Yuan is Heavenly Lord
Dacheng's closest disciple.

450
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,110
He must know how to find the lord.

451
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,590
Grandmaster and the lord
disappeared together.

452
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,000
They must've gone to the same place.

453
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,710
As long as we find Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

454
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,230
we'll find Grandmaster.

455
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,510
Senior, during the battle at Tianmu Peak,

456
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,360
I placed an All-Hearing Tag on Long Yuan.

457
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,400
I'll know whatever happens

458
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,030
in Canglei Palace.

459
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,150
Excellent.

460
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,110
Master's safety is of vital importance.

461
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,400
No mistake is allowed.

462
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,630
Yes. I'll send the disciples

463
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,960
out for a thorough search

464
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,090
in all the 12 states.

465
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,590
Dan Yang, since you've
placed an All-Hearing Tag,

466
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,480
you should stay in the sect

467
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,740
and monitor the activities
in Canglei Palace in real time.

468
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,400
Yes.

469
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,670
Zi Yang, tell your fellows to split up

470
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,800
and search every corner.

471
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,760
I'll be in seclusion in the back mountain

472
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,000
to see if the Spirit Inquiry Formation
will reveal Master's whereabouts.

473
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,670
Everyone, be keen aware

474
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,710
that this matter
related to Divine Lord Siling

475
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,920
decides the fate of Jingyun Sect.

476
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,280
We must find her at all costs.

477
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
I have a question.

478
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,530
Go do your work, everyone.

479
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,710
You may leave now.

480
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,710
-Yes.
-Yes.

481
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,690
[Prosperity]

482
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,590
What do you want to ask?

483
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:44,260
[May your spirit shine across all realms]

484
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,760
Master, you know what it is.

485
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,710
You already have the answer,

486
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,710
don't you?

487
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,430
I want to hear you say it, Master.

488
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:59,660
There is no such a person as Li Qingyue,
a disciple of Jingyun Sect.

489
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,220
But Divine Lord Siling,
an immortal, truly exists.

490
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,940
300 years ago,

491
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,800
Grandmaster battled
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, Bai Jiusi,

492
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,630
in Canglei Palace.

493
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,690
Her body was destroyed,

494
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,670
but her primordial spirit lingered.

495
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,800
With humiliation, she hid
in the mortal realm

496
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,650
for 300 years

497
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,880
because those in Canglei
Palace tried to hunt her down.

498
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,210
Then, she became a mentor to
Master Xuan Wei and some others,

499
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,370
namely the top members
of the previous generation.

500
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,820
She taught them techniques and helped them

501
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,710
establish Jingyun Sect.

502
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,070
That was when she was
reborn in Li Qingyue's body,

503
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,870
who drowned in a flood.

504
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,070
She then became a disciple

505
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,230
of our sect as a disguise.

506
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,230
It's fair to say that helping
Grandmaster get her power back

507
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,880
and return to the Nine Heavens
is the original purpose

508
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,170
of founding Jingyun Sect.

509
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,550
Well...

510
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,530
What about Qingyue?

511
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,070
This mediocre girl, Li Qingyue,

512
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,000
is just Grandmaster's disguise.

513
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,550
Qingyue already died

514
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,810
in a flood in her childhood.

515
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,230
Zhang Suan, you're deeply involved.

516
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,150
Your judgement is inevitably clouded.

517
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,340
Once you extricate yourself from it,

518
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,240
you'll see the truth.

519
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,300
How silly of me.

520
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,500
Zhang Suan,

521
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,510
you went to the Nine Heavens
by climbing the Sky-Reaching Ladder.

522
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,360
I didn't expect that at all.

523
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,510
It's the sect's fault for
delaying your development.

524
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,110
That's not what I care about.

525
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,670
The shining sun is far beyond your reach.

526
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,590
Why stare at it and hurt yourself?

527
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,880
I've overestimated myself.

528
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,030
There's no such thing as perfection.

529
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,070
You're already blessed
to be in the same sect

530
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,190
as Grandmaster.

531
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,590
When Grandmaster comes back,

532
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,680
you'll be rewarded.

533
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,800
Now,

534
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,150
I understand.
