1
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,920
[FEUD]

2
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,979
[Episode 29]

3
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,140
You three should set off as well.

4
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,590
Yes.

5
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,150
Yes.

6
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,070
Wait!

7
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,590
I'd like to go
to Yinlian Sect with them.

8
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Junior, you don't need…

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,790
Sect Leader,
you know I'm skilled in medicine.

10
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,200
Yinlian Sect
is shrouded in poisonous miasma.

11
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,990
If I go along,

12
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,330
I can help prevent unexpected injuries.

13
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
I don't have time

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,190
to listen to you argue about who's going.

15
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,320
When are we leaving?

16
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,420
Come with us.

17
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,250
This is Bai Jiusi's sword.

18
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,510
I'm entrusting it to you now.

19
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Only when Zhuri and Qiyue are combined

20
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,140
can the Infinite Stele be broken.

21
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,360
You and I will each keep one sword

22
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,220
to prevent Xiao
from obtaining both of them at once.

23
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Bai Jiusi's safety

24
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,530
is bound to
the barrier of the Infinite Stele.

25
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,730
I'll take him with me.

26
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,530
Be careful in the sect.

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,150
Yes, Master.

28
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,750
If you need anything,

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,330
just send word.

30
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,110
Wait a moment.

31
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,430
I've heard about what happened to Master.

32
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,560
I want to go with you.

33
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,210
If you refuse,

34
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,840
I'll follow you secretly.

35
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,730
You...

36
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,820
And me, Divine Lord.

37
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,600
You know I'm best at artifact forging.

38
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630
Even without spiritual energy,

39
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,030
I can help you find

40
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,090
the soul-trapping artifact faster.

41
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,930
Alright.

42
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:03,610
Let's go.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,120
Get lost!

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,860
So I couldn't avoid it after all.

45
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,930
You're a spiritual beast.

46
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,330
Your perception is keen.

47
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,250
You must've sensed that

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,640
a great disaster is coming.

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,540
Greetings, Grandmaster.

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,220
Greetings, Grandmaster.

51
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,600
Greetings, Grandmaster.

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Grandmaster.

53
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,310
Grandmaster.

54
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,270
-Grandmaster.
-Greetings, Grandmaster.

55
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,000
You're here.

56
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,620
Where is Senior Zi Yang?

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,750
He's attending to other matters.

58
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,280
What's the situation here?

59
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,630
These people fell into a deep sleep
at the exact same time.

60
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,920
I've tried every
soul-calling spell and pill I know,

61
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
but none of them worked.

62
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,870
Nothing helps.

63
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,920
If this goes on another day,

64
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,070
they might…

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,810
Ling'er,

66
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,330
have you found anything?

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,800
Even if Xiao Jingshan is a genius
at forging soul-trapping artifacts,

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,870
making one

69
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,220
that could trap
so many souls in such a short time

70
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,880
should be nearly impossible.

71
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,430
He must've prepared it in advance.

72
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,040
Zhang Suan,

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,070
use your spiritual energy
to scan this area.

74
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,090
If the artifact is nearby,

75
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,620
it'll respond to your call.

76
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,160
Alright.

77
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,880
Dear.

78
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,050
I'm here.

79
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,610
I'll protect you.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,750
Guys,

81
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,190
long time no see.

82
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,730
My dear disciple,

83
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,260
you tried to kill me on sight.

84
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,980
That doesn't seem right.

85
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,110
Who do you think you are?

86
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,220
You don't deserve to be my master.

87
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,070
Forget it.

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,370
You're just a young boy.

89
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,430
I'll let it slide.

90
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,200
Zhang Suan.

91
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,380
That's his illusory clone.

92
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,930
Attacking him is useless.

93
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,960
The dignified Heavenly Lord Dacheng

94
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,690
has been reduced to this state.

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,890
He'd be better off dead.

96
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,260
Xiao Jingshan,

97
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,000
you practiced dark magic
and used demonic artifacts.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,630
In the end, it'll consume you.

99
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,950
Even with an immortal body,

100
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,480
you won't last much longer.

101
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,290
I'm not seeking immortality.

102
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,570
As long as I fulfill my wish
before I die, that's enough.

103
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,970
What is it you truly want?

104
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,940
I don't want you to waste your time.

105
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,700
So I'll kindly give you a hint.

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,810
I took the souls of these people.

107
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,690
The Joy Stele that traps them

108
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,230
is at the foot
of the mountain three miles away.

109
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,190
Joy Stele?

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,870
Yes.

111
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,780
You guessed right.

112
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,630
It's similar
to the Great Wilderness Stele.

113
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,560
As for why I named it that,

114
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,000
you'll understand when you get there.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,800
Grandmaster,

116
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,230
he clearly has ill intentions.

117
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,750
You must not fall into his trap!

118
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,650
Indeed.

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,360
I have set a trap.

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,450
Whether you walk into it or not,

121
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,110
it's on you.

122
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,420
Xiao Jingshan,

123
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,790
I've seen the illusion you created
with the Great Wilderness Stele.

124
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,190
I've learned
what happened to your family.

125
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,950
The Lei Bird
wreaked havoc on the world.

126
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,270
When Yuan Chenghua tried to slay it,

127
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,040
your family was caught in the crossfire.

128
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,640
I understand
why you hold a grudge against him,

129
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,330
but he's already perished.

130
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,300
Even if you destroy the Infinite Stele,

131
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,760
it won't change anything.

132
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,620
Easy for you to say.

133
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,360
It was Yuan Chenghua's sword strike

134
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,690
that caused the fire in my home.

135
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,680
And yet his name
is carved on the Infinite Stele,

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,080
worshipped by the world.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,720
He was such an evil man,

138
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
yet both the government and Empyrean

139
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,520
turned a blind eye to what he did.

140
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,270
So I have to
take matters into my own hands.

141
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,130
Empyrean didn't turn a blind eye.

142
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,110
After subduing the Lei Bird, Yuan Chenghua

143
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,600
accepted 50 years of heavenly punishment.

144
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Then, to protect the Three Realms,

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,190
he died in the war against demons.

146
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,040
That's why his name

147
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,870
-is on the Infinite Stele.
-So what?

148
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,560
My family

149
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,830
and my closest friend—

150
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,070
five lives in total.

151
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,160
All I want

152
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,040
is to erase a single name.

153
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,000
Yet for that,
I was imprisoned for 500 years!

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,240
During that time,

155
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,580
I saw through everything.

156
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,780
That's why I turned to the demonic path.

157
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
The way of heaven is merciless.

158
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,559
I can't change it.

159
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,210
So I'll destroy it.

160
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,960
So you'll destroy

161
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,350
the Infinite Stele at all costs?

162
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:10,040
Divine Lord Siling,

163
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,370
think about the people around you.

164
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,870
After all, I've spent centuries

165
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,080
watching you and Bai Jiusi.

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,650
I know every one

167
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,190
of your weaknesses.

168
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,870
Dear.

169
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
What you see as a weakness

170
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,440
can become our strength.

171
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,300
Then let's wait and see.

172
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,900
Are you afraid?

173
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,250
Someone's coming.

174
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,970
We'll soon find out

175
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,350
which of us should be afraid.

176
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,050
Be careful.

177
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,800
Xingman.

178
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,070
What's wrong?

179
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
This forest is usually

180
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,220
guarded by disciples of our sect.

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,130
But all the way here,

182
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,680
I didn't see a single soul.

183
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,320
All the more reason

184
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,390
to be extra cautious.

185
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Watch out!

186
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,090
What was that?

187
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,080
The snake vines we raised

188
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,680
to ward off intruders.

189
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,130
Normally, they won't attack

190
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,080
unless provoked.

191
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,380
It seems

192
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,390
someone has already prepared

193
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,440
for our arrival.

194
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
Everyone, be extra careful.

195
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,640
Yes, Master.

196
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,170
Will my mother be alright?

197
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,090
Xingman,

198
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,170
don't worry.

199
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,140
We'll get your mother out safely.

200
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,030
For now, it's all

201
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,350
just our speculation.

202
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,480
The situation might not be

203
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,920
as bad as we imagine.

204
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,530
Don't panic yet.

205
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,150
Let's go.

206
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,030
Kiddo,

207
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,210
which path should we take?

208
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,120
I don't know.

209
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,890
You don't know the way to Yinlian Sect?

210
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,790
It wasn't like this before.

211
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,150
These two paths

212
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,320
shift every so often.

213
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,390
The path with mist,

214
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,630
as long as you don't use spiritual energy,

215
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,230
you can pass through safely.

216
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,870
The path without mist

217
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,400
leads to a poisonous swamp—

218
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,870
danger at every turn.

219
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,240
I don't know why

220
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,640
both paths are misty now.

221
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,270
Looks like we'll have to

222
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,660
test them ourselves.

223
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,730
I'll go first.

224
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,090
You're my disciple.

225
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,750
How can I let you
venture into the unknown?

226
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,440
But Master...

227
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,570
You bring up the rear

228
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
and take care of them.

229
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Yes.

230
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,000
What's going on?

231
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,360
Where is Long Yuan?

232
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,420
I'm not sure.

233
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,160
Someone broke the seal of the Hell Ruins.

234
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,180
All the sealed demonic beasts inside
have escaped.

235
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,610
Long Yuan is guarding Canglei Palace.

236
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,810
He sent me to watch over
the Infinite Stele at Tianmu Peak.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,030
The Stele is protected by a barrier

238
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,690
His Lordship placed long ago.

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,390
As long as he's unharmed,

240
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,510
no one can touch it.

241
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,850
That may be true,

242
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,980
but with Master's condition lately,

243
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,860
accidents could still happen.

244
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,270
We'd best stay cautious.

245
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,970
You two keep watch here.

246
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,780
I'll go find Long Yuan.

247
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:48,930
Alright.

248
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,520
Grandmaster.

249
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,100
Are you really going?

250
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,260
Xiao Jingshan took hundreds of souls

251
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,470
just to lure me there.

252
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,080
I won't let so many innocent people

253
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,280
suffer because of me.

254
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,510
But if you take him with you…

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,130
As long as he's safe,

256
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
the barrier
of the Infinite Stele stays intact.

257
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,970
To prevent Xiao Jingshan
from targeting him,

258
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,600
I have to keep him close.

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
I know artifact forging.

260
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,910
To break that Joy Stele
Xiao Jingshan mentioned,

261
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,770
you'll need me.

262
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,720
Master Dan Yang,

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,060
my power came from Xiao Jingshan.

264
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,460
I can control the artifacts he created.

265
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,200
It seems

266
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,530
I'm the only useless one here, huh?

267
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,160
Useless.

268
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,270
You stay here
to watch over these unconscious people.

269
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,180
Protect them.

270
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,440
Wait until I bring their souls back.

271
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,840
Yes, Grandmaster.

272
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,320
Let's go.

273
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,010
Let's go.

274
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,080
So beautiful.

275
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,600
Xiao Jingshan is after something,

276
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,040
so he probably didn't lie.

277
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,300
Have you found any trace of the Joy Stele?

278
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,500
My spiritual energy is reacting.

279
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,470
Something's off here.

280
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,430
This must be the entrance.

281
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,040
Bai Jiusi.

282
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,490
Dear.

283
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,290
Let's go take a look.

284
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
Look at this. It's so sturdy.

285
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,600
-It looks good.
-Take it home and enjoy.

286
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,400
Alright then.

287
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,420
What is this place?

288
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,870
I really love it.

289
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,930
Look at my flowers.

290
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,600
Where are my flowers?

291
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,440
Busy, huh?

292
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
-You're early today.
-Yeah.

293
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
It looks great.

294
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,440
Of course.

295
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,120
Hurry up!

296
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,670
You're even slower than me.

297
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,540
Why are you walking so slowly?

298
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,390
For small deals like this,

299
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,850
make decisions yourself.

300
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,090
Sister.

301
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,660
How do you like this color?

302
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,030
It's really beautiful.

303
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,020
I want one too.

304
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,750
Wrap it up for me.

305
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,310
Okay.

306
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,790
Heavenly Lord is here!

307
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,050
Heavenly Lord is here!

308
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,720
-Heavenly Lord is here.
-Let's go.

309
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,369
Hurry!

310
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,160
Heavenly Lord is here! Hurry!

311
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,470
He's here, he's here!

312
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,680
-Hurry.
-Heavenly Lord is here. Hurry.

313
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,160
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

314
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,320
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

315
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,000
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

316
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,240
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

317
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,070
Divine Lord.

318
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,110
Why aren't you kneeling to Heavenly Lord?

319
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,780
You'll be punished!

320
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,590
Yes!

321
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,000
Why aren't you kneeling?

322
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,940
Kneel down now!

323
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,290
Kneel! Kneel!

324
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,330
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

325
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

326
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,530
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

327
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,090
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

328
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,690
It's alright.

329
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,900
So?

330
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,980
What do you think of the name

331
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,300
"Joy Stele"?

332
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,030
Sect Leader,

333
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,760
Senior,

334
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,790
these are detoxifying pills.

335
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,590
Just in case,

336
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,070
you'd better take one now.

337
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,340
You should take one too.

338
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm not taking your pills.

339
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,970
Who knows what they really are?

340
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,510
I grew up here.

341
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,920
I can handle the poison.

342
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,480
Alright then.

343
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,080
Let's go.

344
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,260
Watch out!

345
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,500
You must not use spiritual energy.

346
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,000
The mist here suppresses it.

347
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If you use any,
you'll suffer a serious backlash.

348
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,330
Then come up with something!

349
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,000
I...

350
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,040
Xingman!

351
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,650
Senior!

352
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,460
Xingman, what are you doing?

353
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,320
I don't know if it'll work,
but let me try it.

354
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Watch out!

355
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,190
My mother once fed
these snake vines with her blood.

356
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,050
As expected,
they still recognize our blood.

357
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,610
Let's go.

358
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,480
Lucky you.

359
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,060
Focus your mind.

360
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,970
Don't listen.

361
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,380
Something's wrong with that ringing.

362
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,920
Senior!

363
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,160
Where's my mother?

364
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,960
Don't go over.

365
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,090
Look at their eyes.

366
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Senior, look at me.

367
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,030
I'm Xingman!

368
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,730
Don't hurt him! He's my senior!

369
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,970
Senior!

370
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,440
Qu Xingman.

371
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,560
You won't let us kill them.

372
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,240
So are we supposed
to wait for them to kill us?

373
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,150
Master.

374
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,050
Stop using your spiritual energy!

375
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,590
Unbind the heart. Free the spirit.

376
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,370
Break!

377
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,350
Sect Leader.

378
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,820
Master!

379
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,260
Master!

380
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,860
Master!

381
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,290
Mr. Meng.

382
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,260
Don't worry.

383
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,440
I'll definitely help you find him.

384
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,960
My master's Canglei Palace

385
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,620
is no place for you to run wild!

386
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,830
Senior.

387
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,600
Senior.

388
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,750
Save your spiritual energy.

389
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,810
I don't need it yet.

390
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,520
Senior,

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,290
these beasts
have been locked up for centuries.

392
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,420
I'm afraid we're not

393
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,730
strong enough to…

394
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,090
I've sent Puyuan to spread the word.

395
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,820
We'll hold out as long as we can.

396
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,290
We can't let these demonic beasts escape.

397
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,750
Nor can we let them
destroy Master's palace.

398
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,770
[Everlasting Grace and Legacy]

399
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,230
[Prosperity]

400
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,840
How is it?

401
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,660
Is it good or bad?

402
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,370
I wanna play too! I wanna play!

403
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,310
Weren't you trying to divine

404
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,310
whether the team going after

405
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,030
Xiao Jingshan would succeed or not?

406
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,380
What's the result?

407
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,360
This is a bad sign.

408
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,630
All three throws were bad.

409
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,480
Are you saying

410
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,550
those who left the sect
to deal with Xiao Jingshan

411
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,550
are all in danger?

412
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,900
That won't do.

413
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
We can't let anything happen
to His Lordship or Her Ladyship.

414
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,630
Should we go help them?

415
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,480
Do they know you snatched their souls

416
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,770
and brought them here?

417
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,680
Snatched?

418
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,310
Don't make it sound so ugly.

419
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,720
They're living the lives they want

420
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,250
and are all grateful to me.

421
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
You built a fake world

422
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,410
and crowned yourself its fake god.

423
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,640
Is this what you want?

424
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,300
I don't care about any of this.

425
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,340
I went through all this trouble

426
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,550
for you.

427
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,480
For me?

428
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
I want to show you

429
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,640
what it means to win people's hearts

430
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,350
and what a flawless,
ideal world actually looks like.

431
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,750
It's not that self-righteous

432
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,310
redemption you cling to.

433
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,850
You're deceiving people with lies.

434
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,980
Who are you people?

435
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,240
How dare you speak
to Heavenly Lord like that?

436
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,890
Yeah.

437
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,020
Heavenly Lord is so good to us!

438
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,910
Exactly! Without him,

439
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,510
how could my legs have healed?

440
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,510
Stop slandering Heavenly Lord!

441
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,960
He gave me wealth

442
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,430
so I have shelter from the wind and rain

443
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,960
and don't have to
beg on the streets anymore.

444
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,550
How dare you slander Heavenly Lord!

445
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,270
-Who are you to slander him?
-Yeah, who are you?

446
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,590
Heavenly Lord is so good to us!

447
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,790
Who gave you the right to slander him?

448
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,160
You don't have spiritual energy now.

449
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,420
Don't act recklessly.

450
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,440
You're the ones telling lies!

451
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,300
Xiao Jingshan,

452
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,220
what is it you're really trying to do?

453
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,890
The way of heaven is merciless.

454
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,070
Whether mortal or immortal,

455
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,190
most people are selfish.

456
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,650
This is just a small experiment

457
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,370
to make the world

458
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,130
as flawless as a dream.

459
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,170
Isn't that good?

460
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,400
Siling,

461
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,480
you know the world is full of flaws.

462
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,920
Why don't you
have the courage to tear it all down

463
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,680
and rebuild

464
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,310
a new order

465
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,080
that pleases everyone?

466
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,570
You know very well that

467
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,920
we're on different paths,

468
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
but we long for the same ideal world.

469
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,490
You make it sound so easy.

470
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,160
How do you rebuild it?

471
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,680
With your power alone?

472
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,720
Of course not.

473
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,770
Everything,
once it reaches a certain point,

474
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,840
faces a destructive calamity.

475
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
It's destruction by heaven's will.

476
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,340
We can only accept it and let it happen.

477
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,120
Only destruction

478
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,560
is the beginning of rebirth.

479
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,770
So that's your real reason
for destroying the Infinite Stele?

480
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Stop trying to get answers out of me.

481
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,970
I'll give you one last chance.

482
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Will you join me?

483
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,640
If you say yes,

484
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,830
I'll spare the lives

485
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,830
of those around you

486
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,550
and your sect.

487
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,060
Xiao Jingshan,

488
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,180
you've started deceiving yourself too.

489
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,830
If your words alone could sway me,

490
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
why did you waste centuries in the shadows

491
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,590
trying to turn Bai Jiusi and me

492
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,720
against each other?

493
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
My disciples don't need your mercy.

494
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,010
They can protect themselves.

495
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,270
Everyone,

496
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,640
someone here
is challenging your Heavenly Lord.

497
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Someone doesn't want you
to keep enjoying your lives.

498
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,860
What should you do?

499
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,790
They're trying to hurt us!

500
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,240
We have to fight back!

501
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,270
Yes, yes, yes.

502
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,070
That's right.

503
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,790
They slandered our Heavenly Lord.

504
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,920
They must be evil spirits!

505
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,880
Eliminate the evil spirits!

506
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,200
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

507
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,240
Siling,

508
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,050
you claim to be righteous.

509
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,590
I'd like to see

510
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,070
if you'll still
have compassion for the greedy

511
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,200
and the heartless.

512
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,380
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

513
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,890
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

514
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,660
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

515
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,510
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

516
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,590
Dabao, Xiaobao,

517
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,680
what are you doing?

518
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,160
Mr. Meng,

519
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,000
be careful not
to touch their blood or fangs.

520
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,480
They contain deadly poison
that kills on contact.

521
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,610
Even cultivators can't withstand it.

522
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,350
No wonder people call your sect
a demonic sect.

523
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,070
Your Yinlian Sect

524
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,560
is full of lethal things.

525
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,520
-Are you alright?
-Xiaobao.

526
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,270
Xingman.

527
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,740
You scoundrel!

528
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,070
Who allowed you
to sit in my mother's seat?

529
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,640
It was you who controlled those disciples

530
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,840
and vipers to kill us.

531
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,920
The Yinlian Sect Leader and my master,

532
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,180
are they in your hands?

533
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,790
Master.

534
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,540
Sect Leader.

535
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,950
Mother! Mother!

536
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,110
Mother!

537
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,380
What have you done to them?

538
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,220
Nothing much.

539
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
I just made them obedient.

540
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm simply

541
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,830
giving you all a chance,

542
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,570
a chance

543
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,350
to walk out of here alive.

544
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,890
Silly girl,

545
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,000
you really think I'd let my real body

546
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
show up here?

547
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,740
Xiao Jingshan,

548
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,800
what exactly do you want to do?

549
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,500
I'm giving you two choices.

550
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,500
The Jingyun Sect Leader
or the Yinlian Sect Leader,

551
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,720
which one do you want to live,

552
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,440
and which to die?

553
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,270
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

554
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,470
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

555
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,620
Hand over the food!

556
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,030
Food!

557
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,400
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

558
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,120
Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!

559
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,310
Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!

560
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,740
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

561
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,010
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

562
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,920
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

563
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,550
Qingyue!

564
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,400
Get out of here!

565
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,360
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

566
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,660
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

567
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,040
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

568
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,310
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

569
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,390
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

570
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,610
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

571
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:49,120
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

572
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,480
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

573
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,790
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

574
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,210
Are you alright, dear?

575
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,160
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

576
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,910
Let's go.

577
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,370
Where are they?

578
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,370
Where did they go?

579
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,180
Xingman!

580
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,270
-Master.
-Mother.

581
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,760
Sect Leader.

582
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,750
It's simple.

583
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,110
The Jingyun Sect Leader
treats you like a father.

584
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,320
And the Yinlian Sect Leader

585
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,110
is your beloved's mother.

586
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,690
I want to see who you'll choose.

587
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,750
If the three of you give the same answer,

588
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,110
that person lives.

589
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,150
If not, they die.

590
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,159
Why should we listen to you?

591
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,760
Stop! Stop it right now!

592
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,380
Don't worry.

593
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,960
I keep my word.

594
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,550
If I say one will walk free,
one walks free.

595
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,910
You can't kill me,

596
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,530
but I can kill them.

597
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,760
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and try.

598
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,800
No need.

599
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,030
Mother.

600
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,020
Stop crying!

601
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,990
Dry those tears.

602
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,130
Don't embarrass me
in front of so many people.

603
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,710
It's just death.

604
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,620
I'm not afraid!

605
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,760
Mother,

606
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,590
I don't want you to die.

607
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,280
Meng Chu.

608
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,830
I was careless

609
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,550
and fell into his trap.

610
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,020
Promise me

611
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,090
to take good care of them

612
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,210
from now on.

613
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,220
No.

614
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,970
Sect Leader.

615
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Stubborn old man.

616
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,260
Why do you get to
be the good guy every time?

617
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,370
I'm not afraid of death either, okay?

618
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,700
Well?

619
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,880
Who are you going to choose?

620
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,800
If you don't pick,

621
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,480
both of them have to die.

622
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,030
If no one wants to be the villain,

623
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,060
then I will.

624
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,180
I choose our Sect Leader.

625
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,480
Suguan!

626
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,330
Sect Leader, you can punish me

627
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,810
however you want later.

628
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,430
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

629
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,250
What about you two?

630
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,760
Meng Chu.

631
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,330
Pick up your sword.

632
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,440
I don't want to die
at the hands of this scumbag.

633
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,480
You despicable coward,

634
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,560
you can't beat us,

635
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,850
so you resort to such dirty tricks.

636
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,670
We of Jingyun Sect

637
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,260
won't be manipulated by you.

638
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,430
Master.

639
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,500
Meng Chu.

640
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,440
Remember what I told you.

641
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,630
Master, no!

642
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,480
-Sect Leader!
-Master!

643
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,880
Fighting's so much fun.

644
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,540
Why didn't anyone invite me?

645
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,720
Exactly.

646
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,320
We heard the noise

647
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,930
and rushed over ourselves.

648
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,760
It's my first time seeing demonic beasts.

649
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,050
Interesting.

650
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,780
Where are they?

651
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,330
Senior.

652
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,320
All Four Venerables said
they were too busy.

653
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,580
What a waste of effort.

654
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,000
I knew we couldn't count on them.

655
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,930
Even a few rocks can be more useful.

656
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,680
Who are you talking about?

657
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,240
-Senior!
-Senior!

658
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,570
Senior.

659
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,620
It's just an arm.

660
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,400
Not a big deal.

661
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,600
I'll cover you.

662
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,740
You leave first.

663
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,150
You can't be of much help here anyway.

664
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,300
I can help.

665
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,590
Cut the crap!

666
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,290
I said leave, so leave.

667
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,790
Go find Master.

668
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,490
He needs at least
one of his men by his side.

669
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,460
Senior.

670
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,250
No.

671
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,220
Senior!

672
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,810
Senior!

673
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,040
Let me in!

674
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,630
Senior!

675
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,090
Are you afraid?

676
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,630
-No!
-No!

677
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,510
-No!
-No!

678
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,740
The wounds they inflict

679
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,770
feel like

680
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,230
nothing more than ant bites to me.

681
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,320
That's right.

682
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,190
To me,

683
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,710
they're more like mosquito stings.

684
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,970
We just got here.

685
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,130
We haven't even had our fun yet!

686
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,730
Alright then.

687
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,910
Let's fight them to the bitter end!

688
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,280
We can't let them

689
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,410
look down on Master's Canglei Palace!

690
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,230
Honglian.

691
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,090
Look.

692
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,720
I've just taken human form,

693
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,520
and I'm already
in the middle of something big.

694
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,630
I share the same origin as Long Yuan.

695
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,560
I can't break the barrier he set up.

696
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,920
Can you?

697
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,970
You need to ask?

698
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,520
I've lived for nearly 1,000 years.

699
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,570
This kind of barrier is nothing to me.

700
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,990
Then can you help me get in?

701
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,760
Long Yuan is badly hurt.

702
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,690
He won't last much longer.

703
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,110
Sure.

704
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,040
But first…

705
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,840
give me a kiss.

706
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,910
Then I'll take you in.

707
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,220
I'm just kidding.

708
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,170
The water of the Jade Pool

709
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,100
is too clean.

710
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,190
Right now, I don't have

711
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,320
a single messy thought in my head.

712
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,710
Come on.

713
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,270
Let's go help that senior of yours
who once tried to kill me.

714
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,740
Let's just say I'm returning your favor.

715
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,880
Thank you.
