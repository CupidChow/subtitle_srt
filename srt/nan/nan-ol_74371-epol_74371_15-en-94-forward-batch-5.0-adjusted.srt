[Episode 15]

3
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,330
Young Marshal.

4
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,470
I found no trace of carriages or horses
along the way.

5
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,270
Could they have crossed Mount Yunwu?

6
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,640
They're not fleeting for their lives,

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,440
so they wouldn't have come to this.

8
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
But we've searched the entire forest.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,080
How could there be no trace at all?

10
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,930
Could it be that

11
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,330
they've really grown wings and flown away?

12
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,270
We need to return
to Herbal Garden immediately!

13
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,660
Ning.

14
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,400
Wake up.

15
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,290
Ning.

16
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,960
Where is this?

17
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,440
This is an underground secret chamber.

18
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
I didn't touch anything.

19
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,820
How did Sun Haoyue manage to do this?

20
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,750
He must have drugged Senior first,

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,550
then lured us toward his
specially made medicinal incense.

22
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,170
It was my fault. I let my guard down.

23
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,630
He actually went as far as to
use his own junior.

24
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,890
You don't think your senior has...

25
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,290
My senior wouldn't know.

26
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,870
He shouldn't be in any mortal danger now.

27
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,920
Who knows how long we've been here.

28
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,500
Chi should be looking for us by now.

29
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,290
But

30
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,210
no one knows where this secret chamber is.

31
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,960
Even if he wants to rescue us, he can't.

32
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
So we need to quickly figure out a way

33
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,530
to get out on our own.

34
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,260
Can you stand up?

35
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,450
I can.

36
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,940
I still have great ambitions to
roam the martial world.

37
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,270
I can't be trapped here.

38
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,260
Let's go.

39
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,730
This way.

40

[Nose]

45
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
So he is

46
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,310
the demon of Sanyuan Village?

47
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,690
We can't let him do evil again.

48
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,560
She woke up too early.

49
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,320
The dosage was insufficient.

50
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,650
How much more should we add?

51
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,300
Sun Haoyue and Bai Feijue?

52
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,530
Add one more mace.

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,050
Any more would damage her heart meridian.

54
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,450
Let me know in four hours.

55
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,320
Yes.

56
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,340
Young...

57
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,240
Young Master Bai.

58
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,680
Qin Xiang?

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
Why?

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,460
I had no choice. Your heart

61
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,090
could prolong Madam's life.

62
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,440
Your Highness!

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,690
Your Highness!

64
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,710
Something terrible has happened!

65
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,310
What is it?

66
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,260
Her Ladyship asked you to go to
Renxin Clinic immediately.

67
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,120
She also said no one should be allowed
to leave Herbal Garden.

68
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,800
Where is she?

69
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,610
Her Ladyship and Her Highness
went to Renxin Clinic

70
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,210
and still haven't come back!

71
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,050
Bai Feng.

72
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,000
Lead a team to seal Herbal Garden

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,380
and take everyone here to Renxin Clinic.

74
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,450
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

75
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,650
The rest of you, come with me!

76
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,290
Yes!

77
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,710
Come on.

78
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,680
Xiang.

79
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,760
Come on, help her up.

80
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,250
W... Wan?

81
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,760
Young Master Bai...

82
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,530
I know.

83
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,620
We'll take you out of here right away.

84
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,610
Those bastards

85
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,820
didn't even leave her
a single piece of clothing.

86
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,390
Xiang, hang in there a little longer.

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,490
Here.

88
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,780
Xiang was given a higher dosage than us.

89
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm afraid she can't walk for a while.

90
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,600
Let's carry her then.

91
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,370
Let's go.

92
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,840
Let's go.

93
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,150
Are you okay?

94
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,170
I'm okay.

95
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,470
Who would've thought

96
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,070
there'd be a hidden mechanism
under the floor?

97
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,480
There must be an underground river here.

98
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,410
Let's turn back.

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay.

100
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:46,990
Let's go.

101
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,110
[Benevolent Heart]

102
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,890
Master.

103
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,490
Only these few people are left
in Herbal Garden.

104
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,530
Why don't I see Mr. Dong?

105
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,540
Young Marshal.

106
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,850
Young Marshal.

107
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,800
We found this person
outside the inner quarters alone,

108
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
lying in the corridor
outside a stone wall.

109
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
He's still alive.

110
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,080
Fuling,

111
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,800
stay here and look after him.

112
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,410
Yes.

113
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,950
The rest of you, search the backyard!

114
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,200
Yes!

115
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,160
Hang in there.

116
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm feeling better.

117
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,010
Let me walk on my own.

118
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,170
Thank you.

119
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,000
Nobody is going anywhere.

120
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,670
All of you, get back.

121
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,710
Not a chance!

122
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,480
With your hand shaking like that,

123
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,250
do you think your blade can be faster
than my arrow?

124
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,080
Killing you

125
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,260
would be more than easy.

126
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,580
Still overestimating yourself even now.

127
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,080
How amusing.

128
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,480
Why would you do this to me?

129
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,790
Why shouldn't I?

130
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,530
Don't tell me

131
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,920
you really believed
I was deeply in love with you,

132
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,690
and that I would marry no one but you.

133
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,750
But my feelings for you were genuine.

134
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,710
Genuine?

135
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,170
I think what you have genuine feelings for
is the Bai family's status.

136
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,830
You didn't even know who I was,

137
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,500
yet you dared to elope with me.

138
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,050
Your so-called genuine feelings
come rather cheaply.

139
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,480
Seeing how close you three sisters are,

140
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,720
which one should I start with?

141
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,480
You,

142
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,680
you,

143
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,740
or you?

144
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,700
The tea garden has been closed
for so long.

145
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,850
It must be hard to find Senior's
heart source now, right?

146
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,360
Who knows how much longer
Feiyan can hold on?

147
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,750
We may not be able to defeat you,

148
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,330
but harming our own heart meridians
isn't difficult.

149
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,070
If all three of us commit suicide
right in front of you,

150
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,310
I wonder how Senior would punish you.

151
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,330
Suicide?

152
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,290
I don't believe Qin Xiang would dare
to commit suicide!

153
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,430
I just need to wear you down
until you're exhausted,

154
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,830
then I can drag you away.

155
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,600
Stop!

156
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,440
If you dare take one more step forward,

157
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,740
I'll kill Qin Xiang!

158
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,630
Let's see what's faster,

159
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,100
your arrow or my dagger?

160
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,080
I'm sure she's told you

161
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,570
how much I can't stand her!

162
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,440
Qin Wan.

163
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,280
And me too.

164
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,210
If Qin Xiang dies,

165
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,580
we'll all die together.

166
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,330
You crazy women!

167
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
Have you all lost your minds?

168
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,330
Let her go!

169
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,770
Is... Is he dead?

170
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,890
Dead as he can be.

171
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,530
Even 100 hearts can't bring him back.

172
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,920
He came from that direction,

173
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,570
so the exit must be over there.

174
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,120
Let's go.

175
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,680
Be careful.

176
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,130
Young Marshal.

177
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,410
There's no other way out anywhere.

178
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,010
This stone door must be opened
from the inside.

179
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,760
Such massive rocks can't possibly
be moved by human strength alone.

180
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
There's no wind here.

181
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,020
It must be hydraulically powered.

182
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,150
But there's no running water around.

183
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,120
Not on the surface,

184
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,790
but that doesn't mean
there isn't any underground.

185
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,790
Start digging!

186
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,240
Someone's coming.

187
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,100
It must be Chi coming to rescue us.

188
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,920
Let's go further inside and see.

189
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,580
This way.

190
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,080
Senior.

191
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,200

Someone's dead! Someone's dead!

193
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,370
Silence!

194
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,960
Feiyan is not dead.

195
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,370
She's just been sick for too long.

196
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,780
She's tired,

197
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,590
so she fell asleep.

198
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,050
He's gone mad.

199
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,130
I'm not mad.

200
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,250
It's just that you ordinary people

201
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,250
cannot see how beautiful Feiyan is.

If you hadn't interfered,

203

Feiyan would

204
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,250
certainly be reborn by now.

205
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,440
Don't go.

-Come here!
-Don't, don't!

344
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,000

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,100

367
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,970
Did you find them?

368
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,850
No.

369
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,920
There must be another mechanism here.

370
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,090
Even if it's just a blade of grass,

371
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,490
pull it up and check!

372
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,370
Go and search!

373
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,350
Yes!

374
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,020
Bai Feng.

375
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,720
When will they find the mechanism?

376
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,990
Why don't you guys go into the water
and save them first?

377
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,080
Except for Master,

378
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,380
none of us are good at swimming.

379
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,630
Wait.

380
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,130
Isn't the Shuoxi Army supposed
to be formidable?

381
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,040
How come you can't even swim?

382
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,120
What are you doing?

383
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,260
Going in the water.

384
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,500
Calm down.

385
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,140
Chi is such a good swimmer,

386
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,680
yet he hasn't surfaced,

387
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,760
What good would it do if you go in?

388
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,190
We have no idea

389
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,550
how bad the collapse is down there.

390
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,000
If you recklessly jump in like that,

391
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,130
are you trying to get yourself killed?

392
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,070
General Bai grew up in Shuoxi,

393
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,180
which is the driest
and most water-scarce place.

394
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,180
Where would he have learned to swim?

395
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,200
General Bai.

396
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,890
I spoke thoughtlessly just now.

397
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,660
Please don't take it to heart.

398
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,480
I'm just worried—

399
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,570
they've been down there for so long
and still haven't come up.

400
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,900
Could it be that they...

401
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,680
Could it be that they...

402
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,540
No, they won't!

403
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,860
Little Wan'er and Chi

404
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,370
are both blessed with great fortune.

405
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,070
I'm sure they'll survive.

406
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,970
Wan.

407
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,000
Wan.

408
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,960
Wan.

409
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,680
Wan.

410
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,770
Stay calm, Yan Chi.

411
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,980
You'll find a way.

412
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,700
You'll definitely find a way.

413
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:44,920
Wan.

414
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,440
Wan, wake up.

415
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,660
Spit it out!

416
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,840
Don't you want to help the villagers
of Sanyuan Village

417
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,160
get justice?

418
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,370
Don't you want to right all wrongs
in the world?

419
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:58,890
Wake up!

420
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,050
Wake up!

421
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,930
Wake up!

422
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,030
Come on.

423
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,230
Wake up!

424
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,370
You're awake.

425
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,490
It really is you.

426
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,280
It's all my fault for
not thinking things through

427
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,210
and letting you face danger alone.

428
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,330
I can't believe we're back here again.

429
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,030
Your wounds got wet.

430
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,470
Let me take care of them for you.

431
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,690
Get some good rest yourself.

432
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,090
Don't worry about me.

433
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,810
If you act recklessly again,

434
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,240
if anything were to happen to you,

435
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,570
where should I find you?

436
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Your Highness, don't worry.

437
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,770
Xu He has mastered his skills.

438
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,150
I'm talking about you.

439
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,280
In this life,

440
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,900
I only want you.

441
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,250
I'll go change your dressing.

442
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,050
You know what I'm talking about.

443
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,700
Once I've said it,

444
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,410
I won't take it back.

445
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,760
Well...

446
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,110
Let go of me first.

447
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,050
It's hard to talk like this.

448
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,010
It's too cold here.

449
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,940
Let me sit up.

450
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,630
What are you doing?

451
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,250
Now that you're sitting up,

452
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,490
I can't let your feet get cold.

453
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,890
Your Highness, you're such a rare talent
among people.

454
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,290
Treated like this by you,

455
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,680
how could I not be moved?

456
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,850
But I

457
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
have no desire for love in this life.

458
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,460
I've been surrounded by soldiers
since childhood,

459
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,880
never knowing what love is in this world.

460
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,790
At first, I merely admired you.

461
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,330
Then gradually, I came to trust you.

462
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,420
I don't know when it was,

463
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,930
but suddenly I realized.

464
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,890
I feel joy when I'm with you.

465
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
I want to be with you every day,

466
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,880
even examining corpses together
would be a pleasure.

467
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,010
When you're sad,

468
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,000
my heart aches.

469
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,890
I don't want you
to suffer even the slightest pain.

470
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,480
Before rushing here,

471
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,280
all I could think about was seeing you

472
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,410
and protecting you.

473
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,480
Just now,

474
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,520
when I saw you lying there lifeless,

475
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,370
it was the first time in my life

476
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,370
I truly understood what fear means.

477
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,720
If we can make it out of here today,

478
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,300
in this life,

479
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,220
I wish to grow old with you.

480
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,070
To receive

481
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,670
Your Highness's deep affection
in this lifetime,

482
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm blessed beyond measure.

483
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,760
But

484
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,760
I...

485
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,590
But

486
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,820
I

487
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,100
am not a suitable match for Your Highness.

488
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,030
Shen Wan.

489
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,409
I have deep feelings for you.

490
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,580
We once made a promise

491
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,590
to keep each other's secrets.

492
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,330
But I should at least know

493
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,659
who exactly made that pact with me, right?

494
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,170
How did you find out?

495
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,130
I didn't actually find out much.

496
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,060
Your father hid your traces very well,

497
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,570
and my men couldn't even enter
Medicine King Valley.

498
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,030
But you and the real Qin Wan

499
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,730
were once both at Medicine King Valley.

500
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,020
The time of your disappearance

501
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,550
exactly matches
when Qin Wan was in Jingzhou.

502
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,880
Though they say
illness makes one a doctor,

503
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,290
your medical skills

504
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,540
clearly come from years of practice.

505
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,370
Talent alone

506
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,220
couldn't reach such mastery.

507
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,320
There's something else though,

508
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,740
that is your unwavering loyalty
to Lord Shen.

509
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,060
None of what you said

510
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,120
can prove who I am.

511
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,080
As you know,

512
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,710
I never solve cases
based on evidence alone,

513
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,870
and this is enough for me.

514
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,840
Then you should also know

515
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,290
that my purpose for coming to the capital

516
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,690
is extremely dangerous.

517
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,820
You want to clear Lord Shen's name,

518
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,700
and I want to overturn Prince Jin's case.

519
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,570
Our goals are actually the same.

520
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,210
Since you already knew,

521
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,560
why do you still...

522
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,840
Because there's only one you
in this world.

523
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,620
Whether you're Shen Wan

524
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,640
or Qin Wan,

525
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,360
you are the one and only,

526
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,920
irreplaceable person in this world.

527
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,040
If I miss you,

528
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,870
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

529
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,890
Master! Master!

530
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,970
Master.

531
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,820
I

532
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,610
can't see anything.

533
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,960
Hurry up and come help!

534
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,920
Yes.

535
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,750
Little Wan'er.

536
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,040
From now on,

537
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,040
this life of mine belongs to you.

538
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,210
Even if I never marry,

539
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,960
I'll protect you for a lifetime.

540
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,380
If you don't get married,

541
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,570
Godmother might just eat me alive.

542
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,560
Stop crying.

543
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,880
How can a mighty heroine
be shedding tears?

544
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,810
It's all because you scared me.

545
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,250
Thank you, Your Highness,
for saving my sister.

546
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,350
Otherwise, the consequences
would have been unimaginable.

547
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,930
It's what I should do.
Think nothing of it.

548
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,780
My Lady.

549
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,780
The medicine is here.

550
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,680
Let me.

551
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,930
Perhaps I should do it...

552
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,390
Fuling.

553
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,140
I'll go wash my face first.

554
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,340
I'll come back to keep you company soon.

555
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,700
Let's go.

556
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,210
It's hot.

557
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,630
Well, Wan,

558
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,740
I'll leave you to rest then.

559
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,420
Wan, you've turned misfortune
into blessing.

560
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,930
As long as you recuperate peacefully,

561
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,990
I'm sure you'll completely recover.

562
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,950
Thank you, Cousin Yan.

563
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:52,770
Here.

564
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,760
What's wrong?

565
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,300
Qin Yan must have discovered something.

566
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,480
We'd better keep our distance from now on.

567
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,410
There's no need to keep it a secret.

568
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,340
They'll find out sooner or later.

569
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,710
You wouldn't want them to be in the dark

570
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,120
when I come to propose in the future,
would you?

571
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,320
Don't talk nonsense.

572
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,920
I'm not talking nonsense.

573
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,120
Though that basement wasn't a nice place,

574
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,850
I meant every word I said there.

575
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,910
But I'm not romantic,

576
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,890
and my temperament is hardly gentle.

577
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,560
If it weren't for my current identity,

578
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,370
I would never want to live

579
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,430
as a proper noble lady bound by rules.

580
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,570
But that's exactly what I love about you,
your defiance.

581
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,180
The woman who can be my wife

582
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,350
should be someone who can

583
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,150
fight alongside me as a heroine,

584
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,210
not someone confined to
the inner chambers,

585
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,670
who only knows to put on makeup
and rely on me.

586
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,560
What wife?

587
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,210
It's still a bit too early
to use that word.

588
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,370
So you're

589
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,210
planning to love me and leave me now?

590
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,170
Love you?

591
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,920
I haven't done anything to you.

592
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,410
Don't talk nonsense.

593
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,670
You've disturbed my peace of mind,
and that counts.

594
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,060
Listen carefully.

595
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,370
Until my Father's name is cleared,

596
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,710
I don't want to discuss marriage.

597
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,850
Because once I become a housewife,

598
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,110
I'll be bound by even more restrictions.

599
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,730
I'm sorry.

600
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,560
If you can't accept this,

601
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,120
we can still go back to
the way things were.

602
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,850
No, we can't.

603
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:25,960
Why not?

604
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,770
Because my heart
can't go back to how it was,

605
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,090
and also because

606
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,020
I've always intended for you to be

607
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,950
my Crown Prince openly
with your true identity.

608
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,440
Yan Chi.

609
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,480
However...

610
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,010
However, you'll need to give me
something in return.

611
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,160
What do you want?

612
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,930
In Jingzhou, there's Yue Qing;

613
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,730
and at Medicine King Valley, there are
your fellow disciples.

614
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,690
Once you go to the capital,

615
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,160
what if you encounter people
with ill intentions?

616
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,770
To prevent any unexpected troubles,

617
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,570
shouldn't you give me something

618
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,160
to put my mind at ease?

619
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,690
But I have nothing of value.

620
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,740
Even Hanyue and the Nine Needles
were gifts from you.

621
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,040
Then you must promise me,

622
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
no concubines, no secondary wives.

623
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,710
Whether we're married or not,

624
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,300
if you cannot be faithful to me alone,

625
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,730
then vast as the mountains and seas are,

626
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,190
I can go anywhere I please.

627
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,290
Qin Wan.

628
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,550
I, Yan Chi, am not a fickle person.

629
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,560
It was on the battlefield

630
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,640
that I learned what it means
to face life and death together

631
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,000
and to make a lifelong promise.

632
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,570
The path we've chosen is long
and full of obstacles.

633
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,590
Aside from you,

634
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,240
no other woman can walk it alongside me.

635
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,890
To have you in this lifetime
is all I could ever ask for.

Master, I have something to report...

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,970
What's wrong with my eyes?

646
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,580
Why can't I see anything all of a sudden?
