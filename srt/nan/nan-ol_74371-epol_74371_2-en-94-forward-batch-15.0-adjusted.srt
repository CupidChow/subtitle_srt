[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

4
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,910
The bride...

5
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,240
Why is the bride beheaded?

6
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,430
-Grandma!
-Are you alright?

7
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,259
Grandma.

8
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,410
Bai Feng!

9
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,640
Ladies, bring her back in for some rest.

10
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,730
-Hurry. Hold her tight.
-Careful.

11
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,980
Careful.

12
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,580
Rou!

13
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,390
Impossible.

14
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,040
This is impossible.

15
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,710
How could this happen?

16
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,490
I just talked to you this afternoon.

17
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,440
How did this happen?

18
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,600
It must be you.

19
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,770
You were the only stranger
on our way here.

20
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,190
You must've killed Rou!

21
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,180
Ridiculous.

22
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,910
I was asked to welcome the bride

23
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,590
in order to show respect
to the Duke of Song.

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,900
I had never met the bride before!

25
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,900
My Lady,

26
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,930
it's time we left.

27
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,220
Not so soon.

28
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,710
It was your job to escort the bride.

29
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,440
Aren't you ashamed to blame me?

30
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,520
The bride died in the wedding sedan.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,579
Don't you think you failed your task?

32
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,050
I grew up with Song Rou.

33
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,050
How could I possibly hurt her?

34
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,730
You must've killed her
because you and your family

35
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,860
are dissatisfied with this marriage!

36
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,690
Why would I be dissatisfied?

37
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,910
If that were true,

38
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,530
why would I welcome the bride
outside the city in person?

39
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,250
Enough.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,200
Bai Feng!

41
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,360
Have the Black Armor Guards
and the guards in the marquis's mansion

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
watch over this area now.

43
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,420
Keep everything intact.

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,400
Yes!

45
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,280
Rou hadn't married into
Marquis of Anyang's family yet.

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,320
Her funeral

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,610
should be arranged
by the Duke of Song's family.

48
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,500
I'll take her body back to the capital!

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,470
Guards!

50
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,510
Vice Commandant Wei,

51
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,310
The Emperor arranged for Miss Song
to marry Marquis of Anyang's heir.

52
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,960
Her identity was changed
when that decision was made.

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,900
Marquis of Anyang's family
will seek justice for her.

54
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,960
All of the bride's escorts, stay put!

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,660
No one is allowed to leave

56
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,660
until he is properly interrogated.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,090
How dare you?

58
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,350
There is nothing

59
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,300
in the world I dare not do.

60
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,540
Take them away!

61
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,610
The bride died on her way
to the groom's home.

62
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,670
Her escorts are the most suspicious.

63
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,540
The Young Marshal of Shuoxi Army
is quite smart.

64
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,500
My Lady,

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
let's go already.

66
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,470
We'll get in trouble if they notice us.

67
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,210
Maybe this is my chance
to make a breakthrough.

68
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,480
Rou,

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,159
this is all my fault.

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,440
I failed to protect you.

71
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,860
Now, I can't even take you home.

72
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,380
If I had known this would happen,

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,210
I wouldn't have insisted on
sending you here.

74
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,310
Jia,

75
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,930
go check on your grandmother.

76
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,290
She must be worried sick about you.

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,540
[Marquis of Anyang]
[Yue Qiong]

78
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,150
Father,

79
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm truly innocent.

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,820
I know you've been falsely accused.

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,880
Before you're cleared of suspicion,

82
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,290
in order to protect the family reputation,

83
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,090
I'm sorry you'll have to
stay at home for a few days.

84
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,110
Do not go out.

85
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,330
Father.

86
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,180
What exactly happened?

87
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,720
The guests are staying
only out of courtesy.

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,090
Everyone's asking around chaotically.

89
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,490
Prepare some carriages.

90
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,030
Send all the guests away
through the west door.

91
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,650
Tell them an emergency happened,

92
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,909
and that we'll visit them
and apologize in person someday.

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,890
Got it.

94
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,280
Prefect Huo,

95
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,550
the Emperor designated
the bride to be my son's wife.

96
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,620
[Prefect of Jingzhou]
[Huo Huaixin]

97
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,230
Her sudden death

98
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,790
is truly heart-wrenching.

99
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,850
This matter involves two noble families.

100
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,320
I hope you will soon

101
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,970
identify the murderer.

102
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,190
Rest assured, Your Grace.

103
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,640
I'll get to the bottom of this case.

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,870
Vice Commandant Wei, please calm down.

105
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,420
Your cooperation is required
for the upcoming investigation.

106
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,370
Prefect Huo,

107
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,600
do you take me as a suspect now?

108
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,670
No, no.

109
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,190
I was ordered by the Duke of Song

110
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,390
to escort Rou through a long distance
to the groom's home.

111
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,920
She was fine and healthy
on the whole trip.

112
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,390
Yet she died upon reaching Jingzhou. Why?

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,870
Obviously, the Yue family
intentionally caused her death.

114
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,360
Prefect Huo, shouldn't you

115
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
give me an explanation?

116
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,510
Sir, please don't take me wrong.

117
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,460
I assure you I will handle the case justly

118
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,260
and reveal the truth.

119
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,960
Prefect Huo.

120
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,870
Interview the bride's escorts right away.

121
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,040
Do not miss any of them!

122
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,680
Yes.

123
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,960
Vice Commandant Wei,
please go home and get some rest.

124
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,200
All the bride's escorts,

125
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,880
get up and come with me!

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,720
Hurry. Hurry up.

127
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,450
Keep up!

128
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,020
Your Highness.

129
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,640
You came just in time, Prefect Huo.

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,820
The wedding sedan
and her body should be

131
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,280
taken away for examinations soon.

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,150
Your Highness,
I've made arrangements in that respect.

133
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,690
Now, the priority is
to interrogate the suspects.

134
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,450
Your Highness,
please keep watch on this place.

135
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,810
Why doesn't the prefect

136
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,159
have the wedding sedan
and the body examined first?

137
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,770
If any evidence gets damaged,

138
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,140
he'll be held liable.

139
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,720
What a fool.

140
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,870
My Lady, don't meddle with this.

141
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,600
What if the Grand Princess
knows that you, a girl,

142
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,680
do a coroner's work

143
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,980
and hates you for it?

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,850
Then no one will have our backs.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,120
It won't happen.
Solving this case will do good

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,660
to me and the Marquis of Anyang's family.

147
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,510
Don't worry.

148
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,760
Master.

149
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,750
Bai Feng,

150
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,820
order the Black Armor Guards
to patrol in shifts.

151
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,680
Go and dismiss anyone who lingers,

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,030
inquires or peeks
near the wedding sedan

153
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:47,900
and the walls.

154
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,070
But don't hurt them.

155
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,760
Yes!

156
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,150
Circle up the area!

157
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,039
Yes!

158
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,760
Black Armor Guards, listen!

159
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,090
Turn your backs to the wedding sedan!

160
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,890
Yes!

161
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,650
This is odd.

162
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,680
Suppose the bride was beheaded in here,

163
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,330
her blood would spurt out

164
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,170
and reach the top of the wedding sedan.

165
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,770
But the bloodstains on the top,

166
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,650
the curtains and the window frame

167
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,730
are pointed on the end

168
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,620
and long like cast-off patterns.

169
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,830
Those on the bride's collar
also seem wrong.

170
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,310
If she was hacked to death,

171
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,400
shouldn't there have been more blood left?

172
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
But now, only the collar is stained.

173
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,820
I see.

174
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,210
The wedding sedan
cannot be the murder scene.

175
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm afraid the traces here

176
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,080
were faked.

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,910
You guys,

178
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,440
take the body to the morgue,

179
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,920
and the wedding sedan
to the prefect's office.

180
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,590
Don't!

181
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,450
Miss Qin?

182
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,240
[Huo Ning]

183
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,530
What are you doing here?

184
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,690
Gentlemen,

185
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,560
please leave the body
and the wedding sedan be.

186
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,960
They can't be moved before being examined.

187
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,540
This is an official investigation.

188
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,030
A woman such as yourself

189
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,960
had better keep quiet

190
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,820
and go away now.

191
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,260
Moving the wedding sedan

192
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,130
and the body before examining them

193
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,990
will inevitably cause damage
to the evidence.

194
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,710
Can you bear the consequences, gentlemen?

195
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,660
Miss Qin,

196
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,730
as a young maiden,

197
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,920
don't you know what it means
to be reverent and obedient?

198
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,440
By openly interfering with
our work as officers,

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,670
your family will be criticized
for not educating you well, won't it?

200
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,900
Mr. Huo, I didn't realize

201
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,440
that you're so familiar
with female precepts.

202
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,010
Now I understand why you're still
unaware of the importance of examinations

203
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,790
despite Prefect Huo's enduring tutoring.

204
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,720
It turns out that he raised you as a girl,

205
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,210
based on your aptitude.

206
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,170
You...

207
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,450
Who's laughing? Who?

208
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,170
Don't laugh!

209
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,790
I'm not laughing.

210
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,510
Shut up!

211
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,970
Qin Wan,

212
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,920
I know

213
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,630
you still resent my family

214
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,550
for breaking off our engagement.

215
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,830
But pestering me like this

216
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,340
won't change my mind.

217
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,400
You'd better give up now.

218
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,660
Hearing what you said,

219
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,990
I feel so relieved.

220
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,600
Thank you for not changing your mind.

221
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,270
Otherwise, I really don't know
how to face my late father.

222
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,240
-Let’s go.
-You…

223
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,570
Y-Y-You...

224
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,010
She truly left.

225
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,740
What did she discover just now?

226
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,140
What are you waiting for?

227
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,460
Where's the ox cart?

228
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,610
Move this stuff right away!

229
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,270
Without the young marshal's permission,

230
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,930
no one can approach the scene!

231
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,720
I...

232
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,790
It's alright.

233
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,080
Mr. Huo.

234
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,210
My name is Huo Ning.

235
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

236
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,150
Are you the examiner

237
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,610
appointed by Prefect Huo?

238
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,200
My father only asked me
to move the wedding sedan

239
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,390
to the prefect's office
and her body to the morgue.

240
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,480
Other officers and the coroner
will conduct examinations.

241
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,860
Is this the standard procedure

242
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,390
in every local government?

243
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,860
To my knowledge,

244
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,760
yes.

245
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,510
What if the testimonies don't
match the examination results?

246
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,600
The testimonies prevail, of course.

247
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Examination results...

248
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,530
They're not always accurate.

249
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,960
The Black Armor Guards will escort you

250
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,160
to the prefect's office and the morgue.

251
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,640
Stay cautious on the way.

252
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,640
Do not lose or omit any items.

253
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,400
Before the case is solved,

254
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,680
you'll all stay there.

255
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,450
Yes!

256
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,050
My Lady,

257
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,570
please stay away from that case.

258
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,770
Luckily, the Black Armor Guards
didn't notice us tonight.

259
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,920
What if they had caught us

260
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,000
and found out your real identity?

261
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,780
You saved the Grand Princess's life.

262
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,990
We can ask her to send us to the capital.

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
My father's good name has been smeared.

264
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,310
I have no one to rely on in the capital.

265
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,040
I can't even find out the truth.

266
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,510
How am I supposed
to clear my father's name?

267
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,110
But you have medical skills.

268
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,910
If we save more nobles' lives
in the capital,

269
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,480
then we...

270
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,940
Nobles don't always
fall ill on the streets.

271
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,720
Since I knew my father had been framed,

272
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,440
it has taken me much time
to realize what I should do.

273
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,020
I'll have the Grand Princess

274
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,650
trust my skills as a coroner

275
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,700
just like she trusts my medical expertise.

276
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,130
I'll persuade her to recommend me
to work in the capital as a consultant.

277
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,540
But you are a woman.

278
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,890
Who would hire a woman as a consultant?

279
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,480
What's wrong with being a woman?

280
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,500
I will become the first female coroner

281
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
who puts all men to shame.

282
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,790
But...

283
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,440
This case about a headless bride

284
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,270
involves noble families.

285
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,130
We can't afford to offend any of them.

286
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,770
What if the Duke of Song or Prefect Huo

287
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,340
is discontent with your work...

288
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,220
I don't need to please everyone.

289
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,370
In matters of criminal justice,

290
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,430
it's impossible to please everyone.

291
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,580
All I need is the Grand Princess's trust.

292
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,770
My father taught me autopsy skills.

293
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll clear my parents' names

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,750
with my own capability.

295
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,710
I'll bring the killers

296
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,080
of them and Qin Liang to justice.

297
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,440
I'll only please who gives me the chance

298
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,770
to accomplish all that.

299
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,660
I''ll do whatever you say, My Lady.

300
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,590
If you don't fear,

301
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,720
then I don't either.

302
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,610
What have you found?

303
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,040
Is Qin Wan really Qin Liang's daughter?

304
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,380
Yes, she is.

305
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Our intelligence shows

306
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,050
that Qin Wan is Qin Liang's only daughter.

307
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,440
She was born with poor health.

308
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,530
She lost her mother at six,

309
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,200
and was then sent to
the Medicine King Valley for treatment.

310
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,770
She didn't leave until
she recovered a year ago.

311
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,170
There's nothing unusual
about her background.

312
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,890
Only commoners can stay
in that valley for treatment.

313
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,560
Any disclosure of patients' information
is forbidden there.

314
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,570
Even our spies
can't infiltrate that place.

315
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,650
Why could she stay there
for over ten years?

316
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,410
It's said that Qin Liang had no interest
in working as an official.

317
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,440
He was obsessed with medicine,

318
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,410
and often provided people
with free medical service.

319
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,930
People call him "Dr. Virtue."

320
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,010
The Medicine King Sun Xi
and he were good friends.

321
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,320
The former would certainly

322
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,250
accommodate a bosom friend's daughter.

323
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,250
What a shock

324
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,930
that the ambitious
Marquis of Zhongyong

325
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,130
actually has a younger brother
who cared little about money.

326
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,170
The Qin brothers
have always lived together.

327
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,410
But Qin Liang wasn't
close to his two brothers.

328
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,290
That said, his son Qin An,
who he had with his second wife,

329
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,890
frequently interacts with
the Marquis of Zhongyong.

330
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,090
What about Qin Liang?

331
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,170
Any findings
about the shipwreck he was in?

332
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,530
Between the Medicine King Valley
and Jingzhou,

333
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,560
there is more than one water route.

334
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,490
All our men are looking for Shen Yi.

335
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,980
Reassigning manpower now

336
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,050
might impede the investigation
of Prince Jin's case.

337
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,180
Now, only Shen Yi can prove

338
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,970
that Consort Jin wasn't killed
by Prince Jin.

339
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,940
I don't believe a man like Prince Jin

340
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,070
would flee out of fear for punishment.

341
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,260
Track down Shen Yi
and his family at all costs.

342
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,900
Find them, or their bodies.

343
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,290
As for Qin Wan,

344
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,650
I'll investigate her myself.

345
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,860
Miss Qin saved

346
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,770
the Grand Princess's life.

347
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,280
Why investigate her?

348
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,380
Because I need her expertise.

349
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,800
If she's clean,

350
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
she'll be a strong aide

351
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,660
for our investigation
of Prince Jin's case.

352
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Can you believe this?

353
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
A parentless girl traveled a long way

354
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
to bring her father's coffin home
after staying in a valley for years.

355
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,940
She keeps composed,
though under her uncle's roof.

356
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,960
She must be up to something
when she closely observed

357
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,130
the bride's body.

358
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,250
If I am to work with her,

359
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,710
I'd better stay vigilant.

360
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,080
What do you take her for,

361
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,200
an aide or a foe?

362
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,570
Why are you being so nosy?

363
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,010
Are you interested in her?

364
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,820
No, no, no.

365
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,890
I can't handle a woman

366
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,290
who's not afraid to touch

367
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,490
and examine corpses.

368
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,770
Get the military reports.

369
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,290
Yes.

370
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,950
Xiang, Shuang.

371
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,890
What are you doing here?

372
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,369
Don't you know you're a jinx?

373
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,290
What do you mean by "jinx,"

374
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,140
Shuang?

375
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,980
[The sixth daughter of the Qin family]
[Qin Shuang]

376
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,330
Wan,

377
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,370
though Shuang's mother
is just a concubine,

378
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,100
she is still your elder sister.

379
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,360
How can you talk to her like that?

380
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,850
My respect is only reserved for
those with self-respect,

381
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,180
despite their origins.

382
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,300
Stop playing dumb!

383
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,680
Do you really not know

384
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,650
Mrs. Huo liked Xiang best?

385
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,680
If you hadn't irritated Mrs. Huo
on the day of your return,

386
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,850
she wouldn't have canceled the engagement
in front of everyone.

387
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,720
Now,

388
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,370
Xiang can't marry into the Huo family.

389
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,060
You're a huge disgrace

390
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,410
to the Qin sisters!

391
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,090
Shuang,

392
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,170
you'd better drop that subject forever.

393
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,960
If word gets out,

394
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,130
people might think of the Qin sisters

395
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,960
as shameless women who enjoy stealing

396
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,220
one another's fiancé.

397
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,410
Who do you mean?

398
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,090
The Grand Princess has your back,

399
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,750
but it doesn't mean
you can do anything you want.

400
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,760
How much longer can a sick old woman

401
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,370
support you?

402
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,660
When she dies,

403
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,250
-you will...
-How dare you!

404
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,480
Who made that rude remark?

405
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,980
She did.

406
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,110
Slap her!

407
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Nobody in the country

408
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,020
dares to disrespect my grandmother.

409
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,970
Who do you think you are?

410
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,280
How dare you curse her

411
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,440
in broad daylight?

412
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,940
I dare not.

413
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,570
I spoke out of turn
in the heat of the moment.

414
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,240
Your words carry no grace.

415
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,680
What's the point of a having a tongue?

416
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,740
Cut her tongue off!

417
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,150
Please spare my life, Your Ladyship!

418
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,520
I won't do wrong again!

419
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,780
Grandma, please help me!

420
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,630
Princess Yongning, please don't be mad.

421
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,470
I did a terrible job disciplining her.

422
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,170
That's why she appears so rebellious.

423
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,680
I beg

424
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,400
Your Ladyship to forgive

425
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,200
this young and ignorant girl.

426
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,660
I'll give her severe punishment
according to the family rules

427
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,310
as a warning to the others.

428
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,680
I beg Your Ladyship.

429
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,960
According to the rules of the Qin family,

430
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,170
how will she be punished?

431
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,170
Those who disrespect the superior

432
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,500
shall be caned 80 times

433
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,640
and grounded for two months.

434
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,370
That's too many. It'll kill her.

435
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,120
Make it 20.

436
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,650
Thanks, Your Highness.

437
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,280
Take her out.

438
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,520
Mother!

439
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,760
Mother!

440
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Save me! Xiang!

441
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,360
Please say something for me!

442
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,580
Mother!

443
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,000
Xiang!

444
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,410
Mother!

445
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,680
Thank you, Your...

446
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,560
Grandma is still waiting for you
to come and treat her.

447
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,520
We've already wasted some time.

448
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,250
Let's go now.

449
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,550
Mother.

450
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,490
Let's go.

451
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,130
Why is Grandma sleeping so deeply?

452
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,440
Is there something wrong?

453
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,810
Deep sleep after moxibustion

454
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,070
helps with the recovery of Qi and energy.

455
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,550
But it's actually treating
the symptoms, not the root cause.

456
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Didn't you say that

457
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,570
if Grandma could get through
the critical seven days,

458
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,810
her condition wouldn't be so dangerous?

459
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,110
There was wind evil entering
the Grand Princess's liver.

460
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,740
And due to yesterday's murder case,

461
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,410
she was terrified and worried,

462
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,000
causing her Qi and blood to be disturbed

463
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,520
and the wind evil to enter deeply.

464
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
Grandma barely slept all night.

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,690
Sometimes,

466
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,930
she felt sorry for
Song Rou's tragic death.

467
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,330
Sometines, she was worried Duke of Song
would frame others and cause trouble,

468
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,370
which might lead to my brother's death

469
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,280
and then tarnish the reputation
of Marquis of Anyang's Mansion.

470
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,130
Before dawn, she just fell sick.

471
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,500
The heart governs emotions and will.

472
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,810
If the Grand Princess's anxiety
isn't relieved,

473
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,000
and it continues like that,

474
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
I'm afraid her disease will be incurable.

475
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,140
But Prefect Huo has just
taken over the murder case.

476
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,650
Even at the fastest, it will take
over a month to know the results.

477
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,520
How can Grandma's body hold up?

478
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,440
What are you doing? Get up!

479
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,090
Your Highness, allow me to report this.

480
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,280
Besides medical skills,

481
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm also proficient in forensic skills.

482
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,810
I'm willing to assist the prefect
in solving this case

483
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,410
to help the Grand Princess relieve
her anxiety as soon as possible.

484
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,520
Forensic skills?

485
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,920
It's to...

486
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,530
It's to examine corpses

487
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,480
to determine the cause and time
of death and other things

488
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,740
in order to help catch the real culprits.

489
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,090
Your Highness,

490
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,000
are you afraid that my practice
of forensic skills

491
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,130
will bring bad luck?

492
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,130
No.

493
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,490
You're just too impressive!

494
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,640
Speaking of bad luck,

495
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
for families
with military backgrounds like ours,

496
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,610
all the family heads have witnessed
countless corpses and blood.

497
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,960
I just didn't expect that

498
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,410
a delicate little medical fairy like you

499
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,480
would actually have these skills.

500
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,440
In my mind,

501
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,850
medical skills and forensic skills

502
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,810
are both about curing diseases
and saving people.

503
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,870
The former treats physical illness,

504
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,250
while the latter treats
the illness of human mentality.

505
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,370
Human mentality?

506
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,570
I don't quite understand
what you're saying.

507
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,520
But I think you've said it so well.

508
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,680
Then could you recommend me for this job?

509
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,000
Not to mention recommending you,

510
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,330
I'll even accompany you into a lion's den.

511
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:11,890
Wan...

512
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,820
Little Wan'er.

513
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,170
Little Wan'er.

514
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,450
I like it.

515
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,410
[Jingzhou Prefecture]

516
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,850
Chi.

517
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,570
You're a grown-up now.

518
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,610
Yet you still can't walk properly?

519
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,540
That's not true.

520
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

521
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,240
I've heard that Miss Qin
is good at autopsy skills.

522
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
I wonder how they are,

523
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,640
compared with your own medical skills.

524
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,720
I've never compared these skills of mine,

525
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,090
so I don't know which is better.

526
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,370
Since you don't know the extent
of your own capabilities,

527
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,040
how can I

528
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,550
entrust you with the significant case
of the new bride?

529
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,880
Firstly, from a doctor's perspective,

530
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,710
the Grand Princess's illness
is due to her emotions.

531
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,130
I also want her to stop worrying
as soon as possible.

532
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,650
Secondly, due to my personal desire,

533
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,890
I'd rather be a coroner

534
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,480
than be a little medical fairy.

535
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,680
This is a rare opportunity for me
to enter the profession.

536
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,170
So, rather than treating physical illness,

537
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,970
you prefer to heal the illness
of human mentality?

538
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,000
I just think that

539
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
what you said is very impressive.

540
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,320
That's why I mentioned it to Chi.

541
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,470
Yes.

542
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,750
Doctors can only save bodies.

543
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,690
But forensic skills can help
eliminate evil and punish wrongdoing,

544
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,220
awakening the deaf
and alerting the unaware.

545
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,570
Based on what you just said,

546
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,590
I'll help you.

547
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,020
But when it's time for you
to make an appearance,

548
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,150
don't embarrass me.

549
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,330
Chi is always like this.

550
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,280
He can never speak properly.

551
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,170
Let's go.

552
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,170
I won't blame him.

553
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,250
Greetings, Your Highness.

554
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

555
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,970
Prefect Huo, there's no need
for such formality.

556
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,410
I think I saw this lady yesterday.

557
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,330
This is Miss Qin from the Qin family,

558
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,930
Qin Wan.

559
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,320
Greetings, Lord Huo.

560
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,900
So you're Miss Qin from the Qin family.

561
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,930
Miss Qin has some insights
into the bride case.

562
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,570
She hopes to assist you.

563
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,650
Miss Qin.

564
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,720
Now that you've met the prefect,

565
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,380
why don't you speak your mind?

566
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,310
Yue Ning.

567
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,190
Sir, have you found the victim's head?

568
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,340
Not yet.

569
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,890
Have you examined the wedding sedan?

570
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,610
I've asked people to search it
thoroughly three times.

571
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,610
The wedding sedan
was even dismantled into planks.

572
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,470
But we still haven't found any trace
of the head yet.

573
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
Lord Huo.

574
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,440
Could you allow me to read
the coroner's report?

575
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,680
The coroner's report
is an official document.

576
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,830
Not everyone can have access to it.

577
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,690
It's fine.

578
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,190
Let her read it.

579
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,720
Yes.

580
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,760
In this report,

581
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,810
why is there no record
of examining the corpse?

582
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,250
If the head hasn't been found,

583
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,520
how can you confirm that

584
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,380
the victim is the bride, Song Rou?

585
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,460
Who else could be the bride
if it was not Song Rou?

586
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,370
Perhaps Duke of Song didn't want to
marry off his daughter,

587
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,170
so he sent a substitute bride there.

588
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,630
Perhaps in order to
confuse us, the murderer

589
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,370
sent a headless female corpse there.

590
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,170
Currently,
there's no evidence showing that

591
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,000
the victim is Song Rou, the only

592
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,060
legitimate daughter of Duke of Song.

593
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,520
Vice Commandant Wei, who escorted
the bride there, has confirmed it.

594
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,720
How did Vice Commandant Wei confirm it?

595
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,850
How could there be any mistake?

596
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,720
Before we can catch the murderer,

597
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,410
all escort guards related to the victim

598
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,210
are suspects.

599
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,330
Their statements cannot be trusted.

600
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,040
To confirm the identity of the victim,

601
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,280
Lord Huo, please examine the corpse
as soon as possible.

602
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,760
Even ordinary people don't want
their own bodies to be damaged,

603
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,960
not to mention that the victim
has such noble status.

604
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,330
How could those lowly coroners
desecrate her body?

605
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,890
Although coroners are lowly workers,

606
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,890
an autopsy is the key

607
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,000
to determining life or death,
conviction or acquittal,

608
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,610
and the mechanism for justice.

609
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,330
Sir, if you make such hasty judgments,

610
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,610
aren't you afraid of biased investigations

611
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,890
leading to wrongful convictions?

612
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,650
W-Well...

613
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,680
Y-You....

614
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,560
You're just talking nonsense!

615
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,130
Your Highness,
I've been an official for many years,

616
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,650
and I've never wrongly convicted anyone.

617
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,280
Prefect Huo, you're overthinking it.

618
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,560
Miss Qin didn't mean that.

619
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,910
I did indeed mean that.

620
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,600
Your Highness, there's no need
to cover for me.

621
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,280
Matters of criminal justice

622
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,330
are not for a lady to speak of recklessly.

623
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,780
Miss Qin, please watch your tongue.

624
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,550
A sage of criminal law once said,

625
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,580
"Errors in prison cases often arise
from initial misjudgments."

626
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,650
Lord Shen Yi

627
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,890
once revised "The Washing Away of Wrongs"
at the Supreme Court,

628
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,040
citing numerous real cases

629
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,440
and confirming the importance
of autopsies.

630
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,380
Now without even confirming
the identity of the victim,

631
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,930
are you just rushing to conclusions?

632
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,280
Shen Yi? He was an imperial criminal

633
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,810
and was sentenced to execution
of his entire clan.

634
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,850
You regard such a disloyal
and treacherous person

635
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,960
as a role model?

636
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,650
That's just too...

637
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,350
imprudent, huh?

638
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm a sheltered lady.

639
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,680
I don't understand the changing tides
of the imperial court.

640
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,410
I only know "The Washing Away of Wrongs"
revised by the Supreme Court

641
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,340
is the masterpiece of Lord Shen Yi.

642
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,760
It was also once used as a classic book
at the Ministry of Justice

643
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,810
and was promoted to officials
in various places for practical use.

644
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,240
I guess you've read it too, huh?

645
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,430
So what?

646
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,810
I truly cannot bear

647
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,150
to see the murderer

648
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,200
take advantage of your kindness

649
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,530
and manipulate the law.

650
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,680
If you don't blame me for acting
beyond my authority,

651
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,170
I'm willing to help you
investigate the cause of her death

652
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,500
to ease people's minds.

653
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,930
Can you really do it?

654
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,890
Miss Qin is known as the medical fairy.

655
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,810
Determining the cause of death
isn't difficult for her.

656
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,540
If you have no other solutions,

657
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,130
why don't you let her give it a try?

658
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,090
There happens to be a murder case
at the morgue.

659
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,680
I can let her give it a try.

660
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,820
If she's really capable of it,

661
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,680
I'll let her investigate
the new bride case.

662
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,520
Coroner Xu.

663
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,760
Lin Daxing was beaten to death
by the foreman, Wei Wu.

664
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,680
Why did you only examine
the victim's body?

665
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,200
And why didn't you check
whether his internal organs were damaged?

666
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,930
Then you just concluded that the victim
died from a hidden disease?

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,130
I'm inexperienced in the profession.

668
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,570
I've never performed autopsies before.

669
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
You don't know how to perform autopsies?

670
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,810
How did you become a coroner?

671
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,070
Didn't you tell me that

672
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,720
I didn't need to learn, just like you?

673
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,330
Wei Wu's description of the fight

674
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,930
matches
the coroner's examination perfectly.

675
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,040
If there's no fatal external injury,
there must be a hidden disease.

676
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,900
So there's no need for an autopsy.

677
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,860
If the victim died from a hidden disease,

678
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,660
what's the cause of his disease?

679
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,850
As a prefect,

680
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,300
how would I know?

681
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,680
Indeed, you don't need to
know these things.

682
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,650
Since I've suggested re-examining
the cause of his death,

683
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,850
I will surely handle the case to the end.

684
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,240
How will you re-examine it?

685
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,200
I will personally perform
an autopsy on the body.

686
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,120
-What?
-What?

687
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,180
What are these for?

688
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,500
Taking fragrant pills
and Atractylodes water

689
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,110
can help to remove the corpse odor

690
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,040
and protect us from corpse toxins.

691
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,610
Igniting valerian is for avoiding
pathogenic filth.

692
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,460
Take a pill.

693
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,960
Is there anything wrong
with the hand protection cloth?

694
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,520
This stuff is not waterproof.

695
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,680
During the autopsy,

696
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,810
the hands will probably
be injured by the corpse fluids.

697
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,050
No noise is allowed
during the autopsy. Get out.

698
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,670
Let's go.

699
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,900
All unnecessary personnel shall step back.

700
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,030
Xu He.

701
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,180
Write down every word I say.

702
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,900
Yes.

703
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,240
Write this down.

704
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,750
The victim, Lin Daxing,

705
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,870
male, is about 5 feet 6 inches tall.

706
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,670
His entire body is swollen

707
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,200
and is full of livor mortis.

708
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,220
There's a loss of hair.

709
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,820
He has bulging eyes

710
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,610
and slightly parted lips.

711
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,940
There are dark brown blood clots
between the lips and teeth.

712
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,020
There are maggots in his seven orifices.

713
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
I think he died
during the summer months.

714
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,040
About five days ago.

715
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,080
There are clear blood stains
on his wounds.

716
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,200
There's a circular blue-black
blood stain on his left chest.

717
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,540
No record was made
during the initial examination.

718
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,790
Write it down.

719
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,500
Why are they rinsing
the corpse with water?

720
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,600
Fu Ling.

721
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,300
Fu Ling, come on! Hurry up!

722
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,630
Little Wan'er is dissecting the corpose.

723
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,440
Lord Huo.

724
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,520
Did Miss Qin really cut open
the corpse's abdomen?

725
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,710
What does it look like inside the abdomen?

726
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,960
Alright.

727
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,159
I won't ask anymore. Go ahead and vomit.

728
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,230
Is Chi doing this on purpose?

729
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,690
Why is he blocking my view?

730
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,980
Even Coroner Xu is vomiting like this.

731
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,429
What exactly is Little Wan'er doing?

732
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,600
Stop looking.

733
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,430
Scissors.

734
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,690
The heart is ruptured.

735
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,400
I found the cause of his death.

736
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,120
Xu He.

737
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,690
He went out to vomit.

738
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,820
How long have you been here?

739
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,840
I've been here all this time.

740
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,400
Oh, no.

741
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,320
Was he testing me just now?

742
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,680
Has he already started to suspect me?

743
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,120
Why did I wipe her sweat just now?

744
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
I hope she won't misunderstand.

745
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,440
Your Highness.

746
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,180
It's not good to let others know

747
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,610
I'm skilled at autopsies.

748
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,210
Please keep this secret for me.

749
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,880
Alright.

750
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,000
-Miss Qin.
-Little Wan'er.

751
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,730
Thank you for your hard work.

752
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,690
I've found out that

753
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,160
the victim, Lin Daxing,

754
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,670
was struck by a round blunt object
on the left side of his chest

755
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,210
and died from heart ruptures.

756
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,880
His Highness didn't mind the filth

757
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,940
and has finished the autopsy report.

758
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,210
Lord Huo.

759
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,850
If we send people to search
Wei Wu's house now,

760
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,760
I think we'll be able to find

761
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,120
the murder weapon
that matches the chest wound.

762
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,850
However, the weapon
was probably wrapped in cotton cloth.

763
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,060
That was why during the
initial examination,

764
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,930
there were no obvious external wounds.

765
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,910
The injuries only became apparent
after the body had deteriorated.

766
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,830
I'll go ask people to search for it now.

767
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,630
Wait.

768
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,260
If it weren't for Miss Qin's help today,

769
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,700
the murderer would have escaped easily.

770
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,820
Guys, please

771
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,470
don't tell others about today's autopsy

772
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,540
so that Miss Qin won't be slandered
by ignorant people.

773
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,680
Your Highness, you're right.

774
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

775
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,770
It's just a small matter.

776
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,300
No need for such formality.

777
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,230
Miss Qin's autopsy this time

778
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,280
has helped Jingzhou catch the culprit
and uphold justice.

779
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,220
I really don't know
how to express my gratitude.

780
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,160
If you truly want to thank me,

781
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,540
why don't you go back and copy ten times

782
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,800
"The Washing Away of Wrongs"
revised by the Supreme Court?

783
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,750
I was just joking.

784
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,410
Please don't take it seriously.

785
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,730
Just learn your lesson from this case.

786
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,520
What a joke!

787
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,420
What a joke!

788
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,780
From now on, I won't ignore

789
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,030
autopsies anymore.

790
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,770
Chi.

791
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,640
Little Wan'er is so impressive.

792
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,840
Why don't you let her be the coroner
for the new bride case?

793
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,330
I wonder what Lord Huo thinks about that.

794
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,160
Miss Qin excels in
both medicine and forensics.

795
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,800
It would be my honor.

796
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,400
I'll send people to arrest Wei Wu now.

797
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,260
I'll

798
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,820
take my leave first.

799
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,910
Fortunately, I didn't fail in my mission.

800
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,600
I surely won't let you down.

801
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,030
What about me?

802
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,420
What can I do?

803
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,390
Think about what I can do.

804
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,420
What are you thinking about?

805
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,950
My Lady.

806
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,470
Don't you think

807
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,170
you trust Prince Chi a bit too much?

808
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,330
I don't trust him.

809
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,690
I just need his support.

810
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,000
But he's the current Emperor's nephew.

811
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,440
If he finds out
about your identity, then...

812
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,700
I've always been cautious around him.

813
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,410
I don't think he can find any flaws.

814
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,090
Besides,

815
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,590
who says that someone skilled in forensics

816
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,560
must be a daughter of the Shen family?

817
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,880
So, that's a good thing?

818
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,130
Yes. With our current situation,

819
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,960
the more support we have, the better.

820
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,420
The stronger, the better.

821
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,730
Bai Feng.

822
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm here.

823
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,030
What are your orders, Master?

824
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,760
Bring me all of Shen Yi's books.

825
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,170
Why do you need those books?

826
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,550
I want to examine
his writings and statements

827
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,420
to investigate the truth
behind his reputation

828
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,750
and figure out
why she respects him so much

829
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,330
and why she's so interested in
matters of criminal justice.

830
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,310
He, he, he, she?

831
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,190
The "she" refers to Miss Qin, right?

832
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,110
Do you have feelings for Miss Qin?

833
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,780
Bai Feng.

834
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,350
The moonlight is beautiful tonight.

835
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,930
Go to the Marquis Mansion's
training ground.

836
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,740
He, he, he, she.

837
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,460
40 laps.

838
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,260
Go.

839
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,950
Well, Master...

840
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,550
50 laps.

841
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,080
Yes.

842
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,440
Mother.

843
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,530
Mother.

844
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,310
Please drink more.

845
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,540
Yes, Grandma.

846
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,660
Please drink more.

847
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,100
Is there any news

848
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,780
about Song Rou?

849
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,920
Prefect Huo is investigating the case.

850
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,690
Grandma.

851
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,600
Little Wan'er has said that now you should

852
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,270
avoid worrying and tiring yourself.

853
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,500
Is there any news?

854
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,290
Mother.

855
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,440
Please focus on your recovery now.

856
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,960
How can you expect me
to focus on my own recovery?

857
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
It concerns

858
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,590
the eldest grandson of the Yue family

859
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,000
and the entire Yue clan.

860
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,500
If His Majesty blames us,

861
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,810
which member
of our Marquis of Anyang's Mansion

862
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,120
can bear the responsibility?

863
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,960
Can you?

864
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,290
Can you?

865
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,890
Who can?

866
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,570
Mother.

867
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,010
Mother.

868
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,060
Grandma!

869
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,590
-Grandma!
-Mother!

870
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,570
-Grandma, wake up!
-Mother!
