[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 3]

3
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,910
Mission accomplished.

4
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,110
Miss,

5
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
you've truly been a great help to us.

6
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,140
Madam, there's no need
to stand on ceremony.

7
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,390
The Grand Princess
will only be out of danger

8
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,900
if her wound shows no signs of infection

9
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
within the next two days.

10
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,020
Miss Qin,

11
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,579
would you be willing to stay
for a few more days to care for her?

12
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,110
I would be deeply grateful.

13
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,170
It's part of my duty.

14
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,310
Someone, come quickly!

15
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,050
Prepare the Plum Garden for Miss Qin.

16
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,890
Ensure everything is arranged

17
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,180
to the same standard
as the Princess's quarters.

18
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,020
Yes, Madam.

19
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,460
You may go in and see her now.

20
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,180
Alright.

21
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,300
Hurry.

22
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,020
Miss Qin,

23
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,950
please have a seat.

24
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,550
Bai Feng, make some tea.

25
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,680
Yes, Your Highness.

26
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,670
Thank you for your help, Your Highness.

27
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,530
Now, this should be returned
to its rightful owner.

28
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,970
In my hands, Hanyue is nothing more
than a weapon for self-defense.

29
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,440
But in yours, it can be used
to heal and save lives.

30
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,550
Giving it to you is truly allowing it
to fulfill its greatest purpose.

31
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,510
Hanyue is crafted from pure jade.

32
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,320
Since Your Highness
has so generously bestowed it upon me,

33
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,520
I will be sure to live up to its name.

34
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,250
The other day, I heard you

35
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,980
mention Minister Shen's revised edition of
"The Washing Away of Wrongs."

36
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,120
So I sought out his work
and read through it.

37
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,579
I found his case judgments

38
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,140
to be sharp

39
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,459
and perceptive,

40
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:39,390
truly the mark
of a righteous official of his time.

41
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,300
His reputation is well-earned.

42
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,230
Lord Shen Yi has served
in local government for many years,

43
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,160
and his insights are undoubtedly unique.

44
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,370
He once said that criminal justice

45
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:52,190
forms the foundation
of good governance and public security.

46
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,390
I wholeheartedly agree with that view.

47
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,580
It's just a pityâ€”

48
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,190
Speaking of the criminal cases,

49
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,250
when will I be able to start investigating
the one at the Marquis Mansion?

50
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,310
I've already arranged with Prefect Huo
to begin the re-investigation tomorrow.

51
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,440
That's good to hear.

52
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,140
If you'll excuse me,
I must go check on the Grand Princess.

53
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,450
I'll seek your guidance another time,
Your Highness.

54
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,960
Apologies for my lack of consideration.

55
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,490
Please make yourself comfortable,
Miss Qin.

56
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,540
Master,

57
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,900
the moment you mentioned Shen Yi,

58
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,830
Fuling's face went pale with fear.

59
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,770
They won't tell me anything more.

60
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,760
But why would they be so secretive

61
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,930
about someone
they hold in such high regard?

62
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,540
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

63
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,710
Little Wan'er,

64
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,250
this time you not only helped Huo Huaixin
catch Wei Wu,

65
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,350
saving his position,

66
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,100
but also greatly boosted his reputation.

67
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,460
He must be regretting now

68
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,680
that he broke off your engagement
with Huo Ning.

69
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,710
Right now,

70
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,700
I just want to examine the body
as soon as possible.

71
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,760
Everything else is irrelevant to me.

72
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,159
Huo Huaixin may have
secured his own future,

73
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,490
but I still don't know
when Jia will be cleared of suspicion.

74
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,290
I don't need you to go easy on me.

75
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,550
I wasn't holding back.

76
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,330
I was just distracted.

77
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,230
Indeed, I'm no match for Your Ladyship.

78
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,390
Ever since Rou passed,
and her body still lies unburied,

79
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,390
I find myself wanting to
stay by her side every day.

80
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,390
It's the only thing I can do for her now.

81
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,540
All I hope is to bring her home soon,

82
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,180
so she can finally rest in peace.

83
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,100
That's what we in the Yue family
wish for as well.

84
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,760
Thankfully, with Little Wan'er's help,

85
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,330
we're getting closer
to uncovering the real culprit.

86
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,090
Really?

87
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,710
Miss Qin, do you happen to know
investigative techniques?

88
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,240
I only have some medical knowledge

89
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,650
and try to assist the prefect's office
however I can.

90
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,610
In any case,

91
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,220
I'm truly grateful to you, Miss Qin.

92
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,250
As long as there's even a sliver of hope,

93
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,780
it brings me great comfort.

94
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,350
I'll take my leave now.

95
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,530
He managed the give-and-take

96
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,730
with you so smoothly.

97
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,650
He doesn't seem the least bit unsettled.

98
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,090
Most illegitimate sons are like that.

99
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,390
They have to read others' moods
just to get by.

100
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,990
The fact that he's won
the Duke of Song's favor

101
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,590
is no small accomplishment.

102
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,590
Maybe it's because my work
demands constant caution.

103
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,580
I have little patience
for those who are always scheming.

104
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,040
No wonder Grandma said
you live too wearily.

105
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,310
That's because
people's hearts are unfathomable.

106
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,700
Jia has truly been wronged.

107
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,390
The guards and attendants escorting
the bride from the Duke of Song's Mansion

108
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,020
numbered nearly a hundred.

109
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,020
There were also maids
surrounding the bridal sedan chair.

110
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,240
How could a living, breathing person

111
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,950
die inside without anyone noticing?

112
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,070
Jia was just going to receive the bride.

113
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,630
That's how he ended up being framed.

114
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,860
But he doesn't even know

115
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,260
what Song Rou looks like.

116
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,900
Do you really think
that headless body is Song Rou?

117
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,390
No matter who she was,

118
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,080
only the corpse can tell me the truth.

119
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,700
How comfortable.

120
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,990
In these couple of days,

121
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,200
prepare some fine gifts

122
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,100
and pick an auspicious date

123
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,429
to visit the Qin Mansion

124
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,360
and finalize the marriage
between Ning and Miss Qin.

125
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:53,679
No way!

126
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,480
I went through so much trouble
to call off the engagement.

127
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,740
Ning absolutely cannot marry that jinx!

128
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,680
Go. Get out.

129
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,190
You foolish woman!

130
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,670
That girl is no ordinary person.

131
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,620
With her abilities,

132
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,720
she's bound to bring fortune
to the Huo family.

133
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,550
Our days of prosperity are just beginning.

134
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,180
Really?

135
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,460
Trust me.

136
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,160
We'll go with that decision.

137
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,430
My Lady, I was so nervous today.

138
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,950
I only breathed a sigh of relief

139
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,310
when the Grand Princess finally woke up.

140
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,130
How are you not worried at all?

141
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,620
Unnecessary worry only clouds the mind.

142
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,820
Only by saving the Grand Princess

143
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,670
and earning
the Yue family's gratitude

144
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,790
can we move forward with our plan.

145
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,860
It's a risk we had to take.

146
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,910
Fortunately, everyone in
the Marquis Mansion is truly decent.

147
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,240
Otherwise, how could we hope for
any peace in the days ahead?

148
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
Ghost!

149
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,800
Ghost! There's a ghost!

150
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,020
My Lady!

151
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,620
-It's nothing.
-My Lady.

152
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,600
It was that headless bride!

153
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,630
It's alright.

154
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,070
There are no such things
as ghosts or gods in this world.

155
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't be afraid.

156
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,190
But I saw it with my own eyes!

157
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,030
What you saw wasn't a ghost.

158
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,570
It was someone with an agenda.

159
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,790
Uncle,

160
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,560
I've ordered people
to search around Plum Garden.

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,390
No suspicious individuals were found.

162
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,940
Could it really be Song Rou,

163
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
back from the grave to seek revenge?

164
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,710
The culprit

165
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,360
was able to find Miss Qin's chamber

166
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,590
in such a short time

167
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,220
and even managed to evade my guards.

168
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,480
They must be extremely familiar
with the Marquis Mansion.

169
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,910
Lantern.

170
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,230
Miss Qin, have you noticed anything?

171
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,130
Although the perpetrator
tried to cover their tracks,

172
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,710
Your Highness, please take a look.

173
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,440
The petals on these rose bushes

174
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,970
are all wilted,

175
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,640
yet they've fallen in the same direction.

176
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,030
It's clear they were hastily
brushed aside by the intruder.

177
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,400
Indeed.

178
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,630
That person must've climbed over the wall

179
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,760
and paused here to catch their breath,

180
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,490
leaving footprints
on the moss-covered tiles.

181
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,290
Look,

182
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,430
those flowers

183
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,860
match exactly
what Little Wan'er described.

184
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,380
But if it wasn't a ghost,

185
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,720
then how could someone

186
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,610
be floating in mid-air

187
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,910
without a head?

188
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,350
If that person has mastered
lightness skills,

189
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,750
it wouldn't be difficult at all.

190
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,960
They could use the flower bed
as a springboard

191
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,580
to leap onto the stone pillar,

192
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,430
then use the hem of the bridal gown
to hide their feet,

193
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,620
creating the illusion
of floating in midair.

194
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,950
After scaring the two of you,

195
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,750
they could make a clean getaway.

196
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,420
Let me carry it.

197
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,890
It's indeed so.

198
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,790
They're simply using the guise of a ghost

199
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,030
to create confusion

200
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,700
and divert attention.

201
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,910
Tomorrow, you're supposed to
examine the corpse at the morgue.

202
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,170
They made their move
in the Plum Garden at just this moment,

203
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,260
probably intending to scare you away.

204
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,660
The matter of Miss Qin
examining the corpse

205
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,600
was only known to my wife, myself,

206
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,380
Ning and her brother
within the household.

207
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,030
How did the news leak out?

208
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,270
I haven't told anyone.

209
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:58,900
I...

210
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,700
I might've let something slip
to Wei Yanzhi.

211
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,030
What did you tell him?

212
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,310
When we were sparring,
I saw he was worried,

213
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,030
so I...

214
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,310
I didn't mention the autopsy.

215
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,910
I just said that Little Wan'er
would be helping.

216
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,660
The Song family's Captain of the Guard,
Wei Cheng, was also nearby at the time.

217
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,260
How could you be so careless?

218
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,650
I'll send someone to investigate

219
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,430
Vice Commandant Wei
and the Captain of the Guard.

220
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,350
The key to this matter

221
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,280
is to first trace the origin
of this bridal gown.

222
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,100
Perhaps we can follow the clues

223
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,360
to find the person behind this trickery.

224
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,030
This bridal gown is similar in style
to the deceased'sâ€”

225
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,910
vibrant in color

226
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,800
and made of new fabric.

227
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,380
The folds are still sharp,

228
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,260
and there's a lingering scent
of camphor wood.

229
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,660
It must have just been
taken out of storage.

230
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,170
There's a stain on the right cuff,

231
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,930
though I'm not sure what it is.

232
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,100
My Lady, that looks like pine soot ink.

233
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,240
Pine soot ink?

234
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,330
Why?

235
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,300
When I learned needlework,
I specifically studied fabrics.

236
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,310
This bridal gown is made of
red silk gauze.

237
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,540
It repels nearly all types of stains,

238
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
with the exception of pine soot ink.

239
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,580
Fuling,

240
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,320
you've been a great help to me.

241
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,580
This man must be skilled in martial arts,

242
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,060
around six feet tall,

243
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,560
and left-handed.

244
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,700
I'd like to hear more details.

245
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,030
If he were to disguise himself
as a headless ghost,

246
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,190
he'd have to hold the bridal gown

247
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,340
so that it aligned with
the top of his own head.

248
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,070
If he held it too high,
the shoulder area would look hollow.

249
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,490
Considering Fuling's position
at the time,

250
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,670
the windowsill was about
a foot higher than the flower bed.

251
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,620
This bridal gown is about
four feet and seven inches long.

252
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,620
From His Highness's demonstration

253
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,740
of standing on the flowerbed fence
and lifting the gown,

254
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,830
it can be inferred that

255
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,310
the person must have been
at least five feet seven inches tall

256
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,810
to raise the hem above the windowsill.

257
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,220
Only then could Fuling and I,
looking from inside the room,

258
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,420
see the gown appear to float in mid-air.

259
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,770
The culprit likely wore dark clothing
in advance,

260
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,700
so that the legs exposed
beneath the gown's hem

261
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,150
would be hidden in the darkness of night.

262
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,030
Exactly.

263
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,270
What's more, for an average man,

264
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,500
being over six feet tall is rare.

265
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,580
A height like that
would definitely attract attention.

266
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,790
So, I deduce that the person is likely

267
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,070
taller than five-foot-seven,

268
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,330
but not quite six feet.

269
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,740
Then how do we know he's left-handed?

270
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,500
That's thanks to Fuling,

271
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,960
who identified the fabric
as red silk gauze.

272
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,100
What does that mean?

273
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,830
When most people write,

274
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,270
they hold the brush in their right hand,

275
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,270
with their left hand
tucked into their sleeve,

276
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,800
writing from left to right.

277
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,270
But left-handed writers

278
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,500
hold the brush in their left hand,

279
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,830
with their right hand in their sleeve,

280
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,360
still writing from left to right.

281
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,700
That's why the ink stains
would appear on the right sleeve cuff.

282
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,180
And the stains on this cuff

283
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,130
match exactly
with the position on the bridal gown.

284
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,410
Miss Qin, you are truly remarkable.

285
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,050
Be careful.

286
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,830
This bridal gown is quite valuable.

287
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,950
Given the long journey,

288
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,030
it couldn't have been
purchased along the way.

289
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,500
The Duke of Song's Mansion
must have spare bridal gowns.

290
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,380
We might as well ask
the matron-in-waiting to confirm

291
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,860
whether this is one of them.

292
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,600
You suspect

293
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,150
there's a traitor among the wedding party?

294
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,580
If they're really involved,

295
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,860
then the Plum Garden is no longer safe.

296
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,280
Little Wan'er,
you'll stay with me tonight.

297
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Fuling, pack your things. Let's go.

298
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,310
We must act quickly.

299
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,830
Seal off
the Eastern Courtyard immediately.

300
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,900
No one from the Duke of Song's Mansion
is allowed to leave.

301
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,790
Uncle, wait.

302
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,170
Before we have solid evidence,

303
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,470
we shouldn't sever ties
with the Duke of Song.

304
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,869
It would be better to let Huo Huaixin
handle the matter first.

305
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,319
Alright.

306
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,579
I'll go invite Prefect Huo right away.

307
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,099
Split into two teams.

308
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,900
Question the people in the east
and west side rooms separately.

309
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,990
Once you're done,
escort them back to their quarters.

310
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,940
No talking along the way.

311
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes, sir.

312
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,800
Go quickly!

313
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,620
Yes, sir.

314
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,730
Your Highness,
I've made all the necessary arrangements.

315
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,560
Marquis of Anyang,
Your Highness, Prefect Huo.

316
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,580
Coming here so late at night,

317
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,070
has there been any progress in Rou's case?

318
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,270
Vice Commandant Wei, please calm down.

319
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,930
There's something
I'd like you to take a look at.

320
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,730
Bring it in.

321
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,530
This is Rou's bridal gown.

322
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,070
Prefect Huo,

323
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,230
without the consent of the Song family,

324
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,750
why did you disturb Rou's remains?

325
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,950
Vice Commandant Wei,

326
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,420
how could you recognize

327
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,080
this as Miss Song's bridal gown
at a glance?

328
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,590
I traveled thousands of miles with Rou,

329
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,120
day and night, side by side.

330
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,230
I know the design of this bridal gown
like the back of my hand.

331
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,230
Moreover,

332
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,830
this design was personally chosen
by the Duchess,

333
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,620
featuring a hundred blooming pomegranates,

334
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,660
embroidered with gold thread
by Jinxiu House in the capital,

335
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,590
and adorned with precious jewels.

336
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,500
There are only two such gowns
in all of Zhou.

337
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,070
How could I possibly be mistaken?

338
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,550
So there are indeed two.
Vice Commandant Wei,

339
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,270
where is the other one?

340
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,440
Of course it's being kept
by the matron-in-waiting.

341
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,360
What's wrong?

342
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,060
Where's the bridal gown?

343
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,270
Where's the spare bridal gown?

344
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,620
When we were at Shili Market,

345
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,050
I checked it.

346
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,030
I clearly saw the bridal gown
was still safely in the trunk.

347
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,230
Why didn't you check when it was stored?

348
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,380
Is this how you perform your duties?

349
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,710
How many people were responsible
for safeguarding the dowry?

350
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,270
Madam only assigned me

351
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,470
to look after Miss Song's
valuable clothing and jewelry.

352
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,100
So I'm the only one
with the key to this trunk.

353
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,710
But I've never let the key
out of my sight.

354
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,110
I really don't know how the bridal gown
could have disappeared.

355
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,240
Who else has access to this storeroom?

356
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,670
There's me as well.

357
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,470
But since the day of the incident,

358
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,100
I haven't set foot in it.

359
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,330
The dowry matters

360
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,170
were all handled by
the servants and guards.

361
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,200
I was responsible
for sending off the bride,

362
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,870
but I allowed myself
to be overwhelmed by grief.

363
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,200
I didn't even notice the gown was missing.

364
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,340
I truly cannot absolve myself of blame.

365
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,080
Prefect Huo.

366
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,940
Yes?

367
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,830
Take this matron into custody.

368
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,510
Guards!

369
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,710
Yes, sir!

370
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,940
Please spare me!

371
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,950
I'm innocent!

372
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,290
Please have mercy!

373
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,830
Vice Commandant Wei,

374
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,830
you used to keep vigil
for Miss Song every night.

375
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,270
But now, before the seven days of mourning
have even passed,

376
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,470
why have you stopped?

377
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,830
The constant night vigils
have worn me out.

378
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,150
Earlier today, I collapsed
while sparring with Wei Cheng.

379
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,880
After that, he forbade me
from keeping vigil again

380
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,610
and made me copy texts
through the night instead.

381
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,600
That's true.

382
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,830
I can vouch for Vice Commandant Wei.

383
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,590
May I ask Vice Commandant Wei
and the Captain of the Guard

384
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,700
to extend your hands for inspection?

385
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,830
Vice Commandant Wei,
please turn your palms upward.

386
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,900
Captain Wei, why do you
have calluses on your left hand as well?

387
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,870
In the military,
we usually train with long spears.

388
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,670
Long spears require both hands
to wield properly.

389
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,430
Your Highness, what do you mean by this?

390
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,030
I apologize for the offense.

391
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,980
What he said isn't wrong.

392
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,640
He doesn't typically use his left hand.

393
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,860
Vice Commandant Wei, do you enjoy
calligraphy in your daily life?

394
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,720
I practice calligraphy
whenever I'm in a foul mood.

395
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,900
It's a habit I picked up from being
punished in place of my older brother.

396
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,160
Since you're not feeling well,
Vice Commandant,

397
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,870
you should go back and rest early.

398
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,800
As for the matter of the bridal gownâ€”

399
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,530
Don't worry.

400
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,320
I will inform Prefect Huo
of the investigation results myself.

401
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,010
Thank you, Your Highness.

402
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,170
Even though Captain Wei is suspicious,

403
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,890
I still feel that

404
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,470
Wei Yanzhi seems questionable as well.

405
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,650
Both of them match the characteristics
observed at the scene,

406
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,510
in terms of
height and martial arts ability.

407
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,510
They also both had the time
and opportunity to commit the crime.

408
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,660
Your Highness,
when martial artists train with weapons,

409
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,920
do they usually use their dominant hand?

410
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,380
Naturally, they prefer
their dominant hand.

411
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,990
Unless,

412
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,710
the perpetrator is someone like me,

413
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,570
equally skilled with both hands.

414
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,800
In that case,

415
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,860
Your Highness is also a suspect.

416
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,910
But I am taller than six feet.

417
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,310
Your Highness has been in Jingzhou
for many days.

418
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,470
The people in the Marquis Mansion

419
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,590
are already accustomed to
Your Highness's height.

420
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,120
You could naturally come and go
as you please.

421
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,600
If I had jumped over the wall,

422
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,800
how could I have left any traces behind?

423
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,960
Do you still suspect me, Miss Qin?

424
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,230
In any investigation,

425
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,360
clues are important

426
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,530
but so are motives.

427
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,830
Your Highness commands
thousands of troops.

428
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,090
Naturally, you wouldn't lower yourself
to such trickery.

429
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,660
Your Highness need not worry.

430
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,390
These little tricks won't frighten me.

431
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,390
I'll conduct the autopsy tomorrow.

432
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,470
However, the Song family

433
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,320
has always resisted autopsies,

434
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,750
and Huo Huaixin is a man who craves power
and fears those above him.

435
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,740
If any obstacles arise
during tomorrow's autopsy,

436
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,590
rest assuredâ€”

437
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,760
I have my own ways of handling them.

438
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

439
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,830
-Why is he looking at me like that?
-Why is she looking at me like that?

440
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,230
-What did I say wrong?
-What did I say wrong?

441
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,920
Chi, Little Wan'er,

442
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,640
why are you two standing there like fools?

443
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,750
Well,

444
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,710
I'll leave Miss Qin to you.

445
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,000
Don't mess around.

446
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,750
Go back and rest early.
I'll take my leave.

447
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,860
Chi, who normally

448
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,470
shows no courtesy to women,

449
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,110
actually went out of his way
to escort you back today.

450
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,110
It's like the sun rising in the west.

451
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,470
Though His Highness may act ruthlessly,

452
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,800
he acts with propriety.

453
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,800
He's someone
of careful thought and consideration.

454
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,840
Careful? Proper?

455
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,830
Are we even talking about
the same Yan Chi?

456
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,480
Master, there's an urgent letter
from the capital.

457
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,340
No wonder the Song family is in decline.

458
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,180
Running to the Emperor with complaints
before the case is even clearâ€”

459
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,900
they really believe the imperial marriage

460
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
was granted purely out of favor.

461
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,660
Send someone to keep a close watch.

462
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,130
Yes.

463
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,470
By the way,

464
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,420
the Eagle Squad found two skeletons
at the bottom of the river

465
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,510
where Shen Yi fled with his family.

466
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,540
They were weighed down with large stones.

467
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,620
Judging from the clothing,
they should be Shen Yi and his wife.

468
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,750
Can the cause of death be determined?

469
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,830
Only bones remain of the bodies,

470
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,230
so it's impossible to tell
whether they drowned

471
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,760
or were killed
and then thrown into the river.

472
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,030
What about their only daughter, Shen Wan?

473
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,090
Shen Wan's body was not found.

474
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,400
She's still missing to this day.

475
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,240
Missing?

476
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,860
What a coincidence.

477
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,200
Coincidence?

478
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,180
Are you suspecting
Shen Wan colluded with the assassins,

479
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,090
betrayed her parents,

480
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,620
and then escaped on her own?

481
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,860
Bai Feng,

482
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,200
I hadn't realized until now

483
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,320
that you were so clever.

484
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,790
I was just joking,

485
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,250
trying to cheer you up a bit.

486
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,980
Do not jest about the deceased!

487
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,380
The assassins didn't even spare
the remains of Mr. and Mrs. Shen Yi.

488
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,230
How could they possibly
have let a defenseless woman live?

489
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,830
I understand my mistake now.

490
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,980
Give their bodies a proper burial

491
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,830
and bring me a portrait of Shen Wan.

492
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,830
Be quick about it.

493
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,030
Should we continue
to investigate Shen Wan's whereabouts?

494
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,550
Yes.

495
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,520
What else?

496
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,620
There's one more thing.

497
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm not sure if I should report it.

498
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,550
Speak.

499
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,990
Earlier today, Mrs. Huo paid a visit
to Madam Qin, bringing lavish gifts.

500
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,790
It seems she intends to bring up

501
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,590
the engagement
between Mr. Huo and Miss Qin again.

502
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,630
No wonder Huo Ning
looked at Qin Wan that way today.

503
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,870
Huo Huaixin is quite the opportunist.

504
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,140
However, Mr. Huo

505
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,510
is not worthy.

506
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,900
I heard

507
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,670
that Prefect Huo interrogated even the guards
of the Marquis Mansion last night.

508
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,600
He questioned them all night long.

509
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,340
Without the consent
of His Highness and the Yue family,

510
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,420
Huo Huaixin would never dare

511
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,830
to act so boldly.

512
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,660
I hope they find that person soon.

513
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,210
Just thinking about it
still gives me chills.

514
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,930
Such a commotion. Where are your manners?

515
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,880
Truly lacking in etiquette.

516
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,080
Whether my people have manners or not

517
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,140
is not for you to worry about, Mr. Huo.

518
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,990
Miss Qin.

519
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,290
Are you treating me this way

520
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,750
because you still hold a grudge
over the annulled engagement?

521
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,070
May I ask, Mr. Huo,
do you possess world-class talent,

522
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,620
or are you known for your great virtue?

523
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,710
What makes you think that engagement

524
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,310
is worth keeping in my heart?

525
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,890
Let's be frank today.

526
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,830
When Mrs. Huo brought up the engagement
to my grandma that day,

527
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,070
I had already refused.

528
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,150
I, Qin Wan, am here

529
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,100
to specially thank Mr. Huo for the favor
of not marrying me back then.

530
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,790
Don't...

531
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,830
Mr. Huo,

532
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,180
I was just about to escort Miss Qin

533
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,760
to the follow-up examination
of the Grand Princess.

534
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
I didn't expect to run into you here.

535
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,050
I wonder if Miss Qin is available?

536
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,170
I'm quite available.

537
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,180
May I trouble Your Highness to escort me?

538
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,790
After you.

539
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,990
Mr. Huo, you've been working all night.

540
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,250
You should go back and rest early as well.

541
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,040
Yes.

542
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,450
It's not tiring.

543
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,580
After the interrogation last night,

544
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,510
it was confirmed that all the guards
from both the Duke of Song's Mansion

545
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,030
and the Marquis Mansion are right-handed.

546
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,750
They can also vouch for
each other's innocence.

547
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,340
Last night, servants of the Yue family
also confirmed

548
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,050
that Wei Yanzhi's silhouette was seen
practicing calligraphy by the window.

549
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,960
I've also thoroughly searched his study.

550
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,980
Wet ink remains on the table,

551
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,580
along with a half-finished sheet
of calligraphy practice.

552
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,710
We can't dwell on this matter any longer.

553
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,340
What if the perpetrator
is deliberately misleading us

554
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,470
to buy some time?

555
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,180
I'm afraid
the body might deteriorate severely,

556
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,840
causing us to lose many clues.

557
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,140
After the Grand Princess's check-up,

558
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,760
we'll head to the morgue
to examine the body.

559
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,290
Alright.

560
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,180
Ever since that jinx from the Qin family

561
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,620
became a regular visitor to our mansion,

562
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,470
this place

563
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,470
has never known peace.

564
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,680
That's true.

565
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,070
Some fall ill, and some die.

566
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,790
I heard

567
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,790
that Miss Song

568
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,310
was cursed to death by her.

569
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,970
Is that true?

570
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,890
Your Highness!

571
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,930
How dare you gossip behind the back of

572
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,650
the Grand Princess's savior?

573
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,240
Who gave you such audacity?

574
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,340
Your Highness, please spare us!

575
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,140
We just heard it from people

576
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,100
at the Duke of Song's Mansion.

577
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,500
We were momentarily blinded
to repeat such gossip.

578
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,070
Bai Feng.

579
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,620
Hand them over to Madam for punishment.

580
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,150
Yes, sir.

581
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,620
I can now confirm

582
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,060
that the perpetrator is connected to
the Duke of Song's Mansion.

583
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,030
If the ghostly tricks
in the Plum Garden that night

584
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,340
were meant to scare me away,

585
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,570
then today's rumors

586
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,180
are intended to sow discord
between me and the Yue family.

587
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,070
The Song family are so wary of me.

588
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,240
There must be something strange
about that corpse.

589
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,800
It seems
they see you as a thorn in their side.

590
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,000
Aren't you in danger?

591
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,260
Evil never prevails over good.

592
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,990
Once the truth comes to light,

593
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,300
what do I have to fear?

594
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,030
Your Highness, are you feeling unwell?

595
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,230
My apologies, I've overstepped.

596
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,180
The Grand Princess's courtyard
is just ahead.

597
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,110
Your Highness,
there's no need to escort me further.

598
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,120
My Lady,

599
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,410
His Highness is still standing there
watching you.

600
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,830
I shouldn't have taken his pulse earlier.

601
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,830
I let my guard down for a moment.

602
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,440
It's clear he still doesn't trust me.

603
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,340
My Lady,

604
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,560
I don't think he suspects you.

605
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,750
Heâ€”

606
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,680
Don't look back.

607
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,830
We should still be cautious around him.

608
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,620
Once the Grand Princess's condition
stabilizes,

609
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,150
we'll leave
the Marquis of Anyang's Mansion.

610
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,860
Miss Qin!

611
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,100
Take this.

612
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,700
Your Highness, what do you mean?

613
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,900
Please take it. It's just a small token.

614
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,650
I don't deserve such kindness,
Your Highness.

615
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,140
I once suspected that

616
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,520
you were treating the Grand Princess

617
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,070
for personal gain and glory.

618
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,990
Now, despite the suspicions,

619
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,140
you've saved the Grand Princess
from death once again.

620
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,800
What is there to be ashamed of?

621
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,890
Please take it.

622
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,580
I thank Your Highness for your generosity.

623
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,030
My Lady,
why don't you open it and take a look?

624
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,680
These are deerskin gloves?

625
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,470
These gloves are much better
than your old ones.

626
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,470
Deerskin is even water-resistant.

627
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,390
The Nine Needles?

628
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,650
Even the lineage of the Medicine King
only passed down seven needles.

629
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,890
His Highness really put a lot of thought

630
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,680
into this gift for you.

631
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,600
A lot of thought indeed.

632
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,800
He's going to such lengths for me.

633
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,380
He must have big plans.

634
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,990
Could it be...

635
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,150
He wants me
to be a military physician in Shuoxi?

636
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,920
No way.

637
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,100
This will affect my plans
to return to the capital.

638
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,360
I must find an opportunity to refuse him.

639
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,400
Miss Qin, are you satisfied with the gift?

640
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,930
Your Highness's gift

641
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,760
is exactly what I've been longing for
but couldn't obtain.

642
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,560
I really can't bear to return it,

643
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,420
so I can only humbly accept it.

644
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,510
Thank you for your generous gift,
Your Highness.

645
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,710
As long as you finds it useful,
that's all that matters.

646
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,790
Miss Qin, please

647
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,190
examine it carefully later.

648
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,770
You see?

649
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,070
He indeed has ulterior motives for me.

650
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,600
[Morgue]

651
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,620
Father,

652
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,580
Xu He has made all the arrangements.

653
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,990
Please go inside to shelter from the rain.

654
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,860
I'm waiting for the expert.

655
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,490
Thank you, Your Highness.

656
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,040
Your Highness.

657
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,640
How can it be her?

658
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
It's impossible.

659
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,580
Father,

660
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,070
the expert you mentioned is Qin Wan?

661
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,230
She's just an ordinary woman.

662
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,660
How could she possibly know
how to examine corpses?

663
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,310
Father, don't be fooled by her.

664
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,710
My son doesn't know any better.

665
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,470
Your Highness,

666
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,230
Miss Qin, please don't take offense.

667
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,090
Don't mind him.

668
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,080
Mr. Huo,

669
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,360
whether Miss Qin truly understands
how to examine corpses,

670
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,890
I personally vouch for her.

671
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,870
It's alright.

672
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,790
I need to make some preparations.

673
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,320
Please suit yourself, sir.

674
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,340
Fuling, the box.

675
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,550
Wait for me here.

676
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:23,420
Let's go.

677
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,960
Father,

678
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,170
I don't believe it.

679
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,560
Where could Qin Wan, a mere orphan girl,

680
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,739
have learned to examine corpses?

681
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,030
Shut your mouth!

682
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,650
What does it matter
if you believe it or not?

683
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,250
I saw it with my own eyes.

684
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,460
Otherwise, why would I have your mother
propose marriage?

685
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,010
I...

686
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,760
I don't care what she knows.

687
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,719
Anyway,

688
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,159
even if she begs me on her knees,

689
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,420
I will never marry her.

690
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,380
If she really solves

691
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,850
the case of the Yue family,

692
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,949
you won't be able to marry her
even if you want to.

693
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,310
Now get out of here.

694
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,570
I...

695
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,480
I refuse to leave!

696
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,360
Today, I must see

697
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,830
just how great an expert
Qin Wan really is.

698
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,250
Miss Qin,

699
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,140
the instruments have been prepared
according to your requirements.

700
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,540
Thank you.

701
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,980
I won't need it.

702
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:17,980
Thisâ€”

703
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,240
No talking in the hall.

704
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,480
If anyone feels uncomfortable, leave now.

705
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,420
Start recording.

706
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,500
-Yes.
-Let me do it.

707
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,420
Note:

708
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,670
The deceased is female,

709
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,060
approximately five feet two inches tall.

710
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,380
Due to the absence of the head,

711
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,980
her identity
cannot be confirmed at this time.

712
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,080
Coroner Xu,

713
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,920
have you previously examined
the deceased's clothing?

714
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,590
The Song family has explicitly forbidden
disturbing the deceased's remains,

715
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,320
so I haven't touched anything.

716
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:08,970
Note:

717
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,460
The deceased's bridal gown is intact.

718
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,670
Except for
faint blood stains on the collar,

719
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,270
no other blood stains
are visible at this time.

720
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,910
Maggots are present on the neck.

721
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,200
The wound tissue
has a honeycomb-like appearance.

722
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,190
The cut is clean,

723
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,570
and the spine is cleanly severed.

724
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,930
[Postmortem Report]

725
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,670
Go. Take him out.

726
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,720
Note:

727
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,530
Livor mortis is present
across the entire body of the deceased.

728
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,460
There is noticeable swelling
in the lower abdomen.

729
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,140
There are visible bruises

730
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,590
on the lower abdomen, inner thighs,

731
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,190
buttocks, and genital area.

732
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,440
No other injuries are visible.

733
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,330
Her death likely occurred
during the summer months,

734
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,390
approximately six to seven days ago.

735
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,190
The color at the neck's severing point
is extremely dark.

736
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,170
The skin is extremely contracting.

737
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,630
Blood has deeply penetrated into
the deceased's spine

738
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,230
and trachea in the neck area.

739
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,940
This proves that the deceased

740
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,870
was cut off her head alive.

741
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,290
It was a fatal single cut.

742
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,670
If the deceased
had been beheaded while alive,

743
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,330
blood would have spurted out.

744
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,430
However, on the collar of the bridal gown,

745
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,310
the blood stains
are very light and minimal.

746
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,930
This indicates that the deceased

747
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,120
was dressed in the bridal gown
after death.

748
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,710
Your Highness has made
an excellent deduction.

749
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,190
You mean

750
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,610
the deceased was dressed

751
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,900
in the bridal gown

752
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,630
and placed in the bridal sedan chair
after death?

753
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,540
Exactly.

754
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,460
The blood in the bridal sedan chair
seemed unusual.

755
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,790
It was meant to mislead.

756
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,490
The actual location of the murder
is elsewhere.

757
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,860
Where...

758
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,790
Where could it be?

759
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,110
Tweezers.

760
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,950
This is a white-toothed termite.

761
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,350
It feeds on decaying wood

762
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,570
and is often found around banyan forests.

763
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,770
Is there a banyan forest near Jingzhou?

764
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,340
When I came to Jingzhou,

765
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,550
the last resting stop

766
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,930
was near a banyan forest at Shili Temple.

767
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,090
-The banyan forest!
-Why did you come again?

768
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,610
Let me go.

769
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,310
Let me go.

770
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,000
Constable Qi, go with him.

771
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,210
Xu He, wash the body.

772
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,670
Crush the white part of green onions

773
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,060
and apply it all over the deceased's body.

774
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,630
Then cover the entire body
with vinegar-soaked paper for a while.

775
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,090
Alright, I'll go prepare.

776
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,300
What's this for?

777
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,570
Since the Song family
doesn't allow an autopsy,

778
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,060
I can only make the external examination
as thorough as possible

779
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,590
to see
if there are any other hidden injuries.

780
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,090
The nail polish used by the deceased

781
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,150
is Danhua Nail Tint from the capital.

782
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,610
It's quite valuable

783
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,300
and favored by
noble ladies in the capital.

784
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,620
Miss Qin, have you ever been
to the capital?

785
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,790
How do you know so much about the capital?

786
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,940
I have never been to the capital.

787
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,940
It's just that...

788
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,850
My uncle once gifted my sisters

789
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,180
some Danhua Nail Tint during the New Year.

790
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,230
The deceased's right hand
is soft and fair,

791
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,970
but there are thick calluses
on the second joint

792
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,570
of the left middle finger
and the thumb joint.

793
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,550
Is Miss Song skilled at
playing the zither?

794
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,980
I've already sent someone to investigate.

795
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,850
According to the servants
of the Duke of Song's Mansion,

796
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,270
Miss Song is indeed skilled at
playing the zither.

797
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,020
There's also a famous ancient zither
among her dowry.

798
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,270
Is there anything amiss?

799
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,980
Only years of practicing the zither

800
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,460
would result in such calluses.

801
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,030
This headless female corpse

802
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,630
is very likely to be Song Rou.

803
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,060
I really hope it's not Song Rou.

804
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,640
What are these black spots?

805
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,010
Teeth marks.

806
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,630
Before Miss Song got married,

807
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,190
she might have had an affair with someone.
