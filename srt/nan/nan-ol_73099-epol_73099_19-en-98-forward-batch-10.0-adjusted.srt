[Peace]

4
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,710
You're awake.

5
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,030
I wanted to take a nap,

6
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,760
but I didn't expect to sleep so deeply.

7
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,320
How are you feeling?

8
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,820
Do you still feel weak and light-headed?

9
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,580
Much better.

10
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,850
That's good.

11
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,079
Our magic has been sealed.

12
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
Forcibly using it

13
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,630
will cause the two types
of spiritual energy to clash in your body.

14
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,160
You know the consequences.

15
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,100
Why did you still do it?

16
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,870
Today in the alley,

17
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,640
I encountered the evil spirit.

18
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Its true form is a mass of black mist.

19
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,880
It hasn't transformed into human form.

20
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,720
In the alley, it wanted to attack Tao.

21
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,770
In that life-or-death moment,
I had no time to think.

22
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,640
So the evil spirit rumor is true?

23
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,470
But I haven't figured out the origin

24
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,710
of the evil spirit.

25
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,470
And I don't know why it's here.

26
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,630
In that case, you should rest well
for the next few days.

27
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,960
I'll investigate the evil spirit matter.

28
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,480
The evil spirit is vicious,
and its magic is unpredictable.

29
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,870
Besides, it's in the shadows
while we stand in the light.

30
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,950
Be careful.

31
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,830
Don't worry. I know what to do.

32
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,000
Rest well. I'm leaving.

33
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,510
Thank you.

34
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,330
Thank you for taking care of me.

35
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,480
We're both here,
and our lives are tied as one.

36
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm not just doing this for you.

37
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,420
I'm doing this for myself as well.

Zhang Suan.

40
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,750
Do you think Divine Lord
would come to a place like this?

41
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,550
There's not even a place to rest.

42
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,720
You...

43
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,630
It's so dark here.

44
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,480
What can you possibly find?

45
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,650
I didn't force you to come.

46
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,950
If you're unwilling,

47
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,430
you can leave.

48
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,970
That line again?

49
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,870
At the rate you're going,

50
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,870
who knows when we can find anything?

51
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,310
Let me help you.

52
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,630
This place is unusually strange.

53
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,360
Be careful.

54
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,130
Are you worried about me?

55
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,180
Stop!

56
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,170
Come in.

57
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,770
Dinner is ready.

58
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Thank you.

59
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,220
How are your injuries?

60
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
Nothing serious.

61
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,450
Still acting tough.

62
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,840
Forcibly using magic

63
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,270
can cause two streams
of spiritual energy to clash in your body.

64
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,330
That pain is no less

65
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,800
than having your heart gouged out.

66
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,300
And you say it's nothing serious?

67
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,840
You seem to know it well.

68
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,800
Have you forgotten?

69
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,000
My magic was sealed before.

70
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,040
Of course I have experience.

71
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,970
I'm done eating.

72
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,510
We've been set up.

73
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,770
Show yourself.

74
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,530
Hiding like a cowardâ€”
what kind of skill is that?

75
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,080
Are you alright?

76
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,330
Don't let him escape.

77
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,240
Who?

78
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,510
That evil spirit.

79
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,670
Keep running.

80
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
Let's see who's fasterâ€”

81
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,390
you or my sword.

[Songhe County]

83
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,030
These days,

84
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,700
I've searched
every corner of Songhe County,

85
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,760
but found no trace of the evil spirit.

86
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,200
So I'm thinking

87
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,510
maybe it's not in the county,

88
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,240
but somewhere outside.

89
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,460
Did you find anything in the outskirts?

90
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,400
No,

91
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,820
because I can't even leave Songhe County.

92
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,430
Candied haws. Want some?

93
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,840
Speak plainly.

94
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,980
I'm not an evil spirit!

95
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,320
Watch your attitude.

96
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,210
Say it again.

97
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm not an evil spirit.

98
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,690
Disgusting.

99
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,150
Enough.

100
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
I have questions for him.

101
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,120
Have you seen two immortals
fall into this place?

102
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,320
A man and a woman, both dressed in white.

103
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,290
Never seen them.

104
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,930
If you won't tell me the truth,

105
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll toss you into the alchemy furnace

106
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,460
and refine you into a pill.

107
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
I've only been here for seven days.

108
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,730
I've never seen any immortals.

109
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,080
Liar.

110
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,200
You saw their powerful spiritual energy,

111
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,840
so you decided to hide them away,

112
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,770
planning to secretly refine them.

113
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,390
Am I right?

114
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,630
No matter what,

115
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,240
I'm a spirit
who has cultivated for centuries.

116
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm practically
half a step into immortality.

117
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,240
I've indeed played some tricks,

118
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,600
but refining immortals is pure evil.

119
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,060
I'd never do that.

120
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,000
You think you haven't done enough

121
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,870
vile things?

122
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,890
What do you mean?

123
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,790
Before I came, I heard

124
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,550
Songhe County is so desolate and ruined

125
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,490
because of an evil spirit.

126
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,600
The evil spirit they mentioned isn't me.

127
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
First, someone in Songhe County
had his heart dug out.

128
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,360
Then the county was frosted for no reason.

129
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,870
That's what scared everyone away.

130
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,510
Is that true?

131
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,390
Of course.

132
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,960
If you don't believe me,

133
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
you can check my core.

134
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,090
You're also a cultivator.

135
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,270
You know

136
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,240
if a core is tainted with blood,

137
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,870
it will be shrouded in a bloody aura.

138
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,470
What he said is true.

139
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
The evil spirit in Songhe County

140
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,720
is not him.

141
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,910
I told you it's not me!

142
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
Release me now!

143
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,960
I didn't aim properly.

144
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,390
This place is so desolate and ruined.

145
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,720
What are you doing here?

146
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,520
I'm here for the Peach Blossom Garden.

147
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,090
The Peach Blossom Garden?

148
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,270
A place of bliss beyond the world.

149
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,440
I heard that those who accidentally
entered the Peach Blossom Garden here

150
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
reached the place they desired most

151
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,360
and saw the person they longed for most.

152
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Have you found it?

153
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,000
Not yet.

154
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,840
But I will someday.

155
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,840
You believe something so mystical?

156
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,730
Maybe someone tricked you.

157
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,160
Of course it's real.

158
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,440
Someone who came out told me

159
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,050
it's a paradise inside

160
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,380
and it has everything you could want.

161
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,580
The Peach Blossom Garden?

162
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,670
The barrier is exceptionally strong.

163
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,130
Our power has been sealed.

164
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,020
Even if we try our best,
we can't break it.

165
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,840
We might even end up hurting ourselves.

166
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,560
This seems to be
the ancient Dragon Imprisonment Formation.

167
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,220
It's a high-level formation.

168
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,110
Only those from the divine realm
can master it.

169
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,860
How could an evil spirit
have such ability?

170
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
If gods can do it, why can't humans?

171
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,750
Aren't we both gods?

172
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,450
Yet we're trapped in the mortal realm.

173
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,520
After all this talk,
do you have a way to break it?

174
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,930
Yes, but it's useless.

175
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,829
There are only two ways
to break this kind of barrier.

176
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,359
First, find the formation eye
and destroy it.

177
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,730
Second, kill the person
who set up the formation.

178
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,450
Given the current situation,

179
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,380
killing the evil spirit
is the quickest way.

180
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,240
But our power has been sealed.

181
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,800
I'm afraid we're no match for it.

182
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,040
We should still try our best.

183
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,830
The evil spirit
has been slaughtering civilians.

184
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,560
The dead's resentful energy
and the alive's fear

185
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,280
will only make it stronger.

186
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,260
If we delay any longer,

187
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,130
I'm afraid things will get worse.

188
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,350
But it hides in the dark,
and we're exposed. Our chances are slim.

189
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,700
Victory in battle often depends
not on strength,

190
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,960
but on strategy.

191
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,970
Ancient formations come in three levels.

192
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,060
Third-level formations
draw on nature's spirits.

193
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,410
Mountains are yang, and water is yin.

194
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,080
This is called the Earth Way.

195
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,640
Second-level formations
rely on the light of the stars.

196
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
Celestial stems are yang,
and earthly branches are yin.

197
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,860
This is called the Heaven Way.

198
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,650
While first-level formations
require the power of living beings.

199
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,320
Humans are the spirit
of all living things,

200
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,400
representing the purest yin, yang,
kindness, and innocence.

201
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,000
This is called the Human Way.

202
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,280
The harmony of Heaven, Earth, and Human
is the supreme formation.

203
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,550
You seem pretty comfortable
living like a mortal.

204
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,640
Before sealing your magic,
you prepared not only money,

205
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,570
but also so many spiritual stones.

206
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,930
Bai Jiusi, are you that afraid of death?

207
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,360
I've always been thorough.

208
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,990
You keep saying
I don't understand mortals,

209
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,130
but look,

210
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,500
I understand them better than anyone.

211
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,150
That's just what you think.

212
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,910
When the ten-year pact ends,

213
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
you'll know

214
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,310
how ridiculous that sounds.

215
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,620
You let the monkey spirit go.

216
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Where do you plan to look for her now?

217
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,330
I'm not going anywhere.

218
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
I'll stay right here.

219
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,590
Here?

220
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,060
Songhe County is so desolate now.

221
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,750
If you cough,
people within 3.3 miles could hear it.

222
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,950
Where could anyone possibly be hiding?

223
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,490
Just because you can't see it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

224
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,930
Maybe the Peach Blossom Garden does exist.

225
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,970
It really can trap people
in another time and space.

226
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,410
You're also a cultivator.

227
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,550
Do you really believe there is

228
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,550
such a mystical place in this world?

229
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,410
I once read
about a magical artifact in a book.

230
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,250
It's something with effects
similar to the Peach Blossom Garden.

231
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,570
What magical artifact? Tell me about it.

232
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,750
It's an ancient divine artifact
called the Great Wilderness Stele.

233
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,680
It was once refined by an immortal.

234
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,350
The stele has the power to capture souls
and confine primordial spirits.

235
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,440
Those who enter it are as if
entering an illusion or a barrier.

236
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,500
The difference isâ€”

237
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,960
the illusion is created by the caster.

238
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,750
With a single thought,
he can conjure endless realities.

239
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,540
It can place someone in a land of bliss

240
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,480
or trap them in an abyss of torment.

241
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,600
According to what you said,

242
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,310
the Great Wilderness Stele
doesn't sound like a divine artifact.

243
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,240
It sounds more like an evil object.

244
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,240
Swords can hurt people,

245
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,690
but they can also protect them.

246
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,080
Whether a magical artifact is good or evil

247
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,960
depends entirely on the one who wields it.

248
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,500
Then this magical artifactâ€”whose is it?

249
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,040
I've lived for centuries
and never heard of it.

250
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,070
Did you make it up?

251
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,280
The book
didn't mention the immortal's name.

252
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,010
Back when I was in the sect,

253
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,680
there were a few years when my foundation
was completely destroyed.

254
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,830
So I spent

255
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,090
almost all of those years in the library.

256
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,590
I read every book in there.

257
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,650
That's how I came to know
about these rare artifacts.

258
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,070
The library of Jingyun Sect?

259
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,600
Then it might be true.

260
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,550
If that's really the case,

261
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,110
this is far beyond what you can handle.

262
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,040
You'd better return to your sect
while you still can.

263
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,290
Are you here to help me find her or not?

264
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,880
All you do is say discouraging things.

265
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,850
I really don't see
how worried you are about Qingyue.

266
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,440
I've known Divine Lord Siling

267
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,570
far longer than you.

268
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,420
Of course I'm not like you,

269
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,110
fretting over everything blindly.

270
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,110
Mrs. Lin.

271
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,790
Your dishes.

272
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,920
I heard your son
encountered an evil spirit a few days ago.

273
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,680
Is it true?

274
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,240
What evil spirit?

275
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,790
It's nonsense. Don't spread rumors.

276
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,460
I'm not spreading rumors.

277
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,110
I really did hear something.

278
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,720
The bamboo scaffolds in the alley
suddenly collapsed.

279
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,380
They nearly crushed your son.

280
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,830
Those bamboo scaffolds
had been there for a long time.

281
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,430
They were already unstable.

282
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
That can't be.

283
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,510
I passed by a few days ago.

284
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,710
I saw people climbing on them every day.

285
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,720
They were very sturdy.

286
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,830
Now they suddenly collapsed.

287
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,960
It must be the work of that evil spirit.

288
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,350
Mrs. Lin, don't worry.

289
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,720
I don't mean anything else.

290
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,480
I just want to ask
if there's a way to escape.

291
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,880
Just in case.

292
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,070
I...

293
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,440
Uncle Bai!

294
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,310
Uncle Bai, please take me as your disciple

295
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,370
and teach me magic.

296
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,440
I told you.

297
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,440
Get up.

298
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,830
The child doesn't know any better.
Please don't take it to heart, Mr. Bai.

299
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,360
Let's go.

300
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,160
Uncle Bai!

301
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,090
-Uncle Bai!
-Let's go.

302
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,200
-Could Mr. Bai truly know magic?
-Uncle Bai!

303
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Uncle Bai!

304
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,270
-Let's eat.
-Uncle Bai!

305
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,480
Mr. Bai.

306
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,880
Mr. Bai.

307
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,880
I've been waiting here

308
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,790
because I want to ask you something.

309
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,590
Mr. Bai.

310
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,480
Are you really an immortal?

311
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,720
Mr. Bai,

312
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,640
you saved my Tao yesterday.

313
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,260
I haven't had the chance to thank you.

314
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,750
So let me thank you now.

315
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,440
No need to be polite.

316
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,510
Mr. Bai.

317
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,100
Since you have such powerâ€”

318
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,720
when that fire broke out six years ago,

319
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,310
you were clearly at home.

320
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,400
Why did you watch my husband

321
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,440
die in the flames?

322
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,570
He regarded you as his dearest friend.

323
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,450
Since you...

324
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,900
Since you could save Tao,

325
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,790
why couldn't you save him?

326
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,270
I know whether to save someone or not
is your choice.

327
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,440
I shouldn't ask you or blame you.

328
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,440
But...

329
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,030
I just feel that my husband...

330
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,240
my husband was too foolish.

331
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,070
Mr. Bai.

333
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,590
In the future,

334
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,120
please stay away from my Tao.
