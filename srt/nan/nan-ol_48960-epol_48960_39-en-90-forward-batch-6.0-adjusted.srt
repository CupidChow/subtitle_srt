00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,420
Why?

176
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,680
How could it dissolve?

177
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,500
What's wrong with me?

178
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,980
Why?

179
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,300
Only Princess Xuan's bloodline

180
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,310
can destroy the mother Karmic Bug.

181
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,690

182

184
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,980
the true descendant

185
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
of Prince Fangji and Princess Xuan?

186
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,980
Impossible.

187
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,730
Absolutely impossible.

188
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,260
I have Consort Xuan's token.

189
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,960
Nanyin's totem is engraved on the jade pendant.

190
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:00,950
Look.

191
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,540
Take a good look.

192
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,810
I am the descendant of Consort Xuan,

193
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,340
the Supreme Lord of Nanyin.

194
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,180
Feng Qing, you recognized me because of this.

195
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,460
Also,

196
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,280
this scar on my wrist

197
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,660
is the important clue you've been looking for.

198
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,830
Do you dare to say

199
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,670
I'm not the one you're looking for?

200
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,970
Ridiculous.

201
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,180
Shan Gudao,

202
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,400
do you really think you're a nobleman from Nanyin?

203
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,840
You were just a little beggar

204
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,710
Qi Mushan and I

205
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,330
took from a group of beggars.

206
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,490
I can tell you now

207
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,680
what really happened.

208
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,980
Back then, Qi Mushan

209
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,110
and Li Xiangyi's father were best friends.

210
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,490
The Li family used to live in seclusion.

211
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,480
But one day, in order to save someone,

212
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,830
they angered the bandits in the mountain.

213
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,280
The bandits attacked the Li family overnight

214
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,720
and killed the Li family.

215
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,460
Only two sons survived

216
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,590
and they were left on the streets.

217
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,540
After Qi Mushan and I found out about the disaster,

218
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,140
we searched for the two sons.

219
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,570
Unfortunately,

220
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,800
when we found them,

221
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,870
Li Xiangxian, the eldest son of the Li family, had passed away from sickness.

222
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,990
This jade pendant is all I have.

223
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,190
I'll give it to you.

224
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,780
Please take care of

225
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,120

229
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,480

-Xiangxian.

231
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,290
Li Xiangyi, who was less than four years old, from the group of beggars,

232
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,090
and

233
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,580
the little beggar who was close in age to Li Xiangxian

234
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,940
that guarded Li Xiangyi.

235
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,560
Is this Xiangxian?

236
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,420
Who are you?

237

-You are Shan Gudao.

239
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,390
I'm Li Xiangyi.

240
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,450
You said you would be my brother.

241
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,950
That jade pendant belongs to you.

242
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,630
This little beggar was you.

243
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,260
Nonsense!

244
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,780
It's all nonsense.

245
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,650
How come I never knew about this?

246
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,420
Madam,

247
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,340
are you lying?

248
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,460
Fine.

249
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,420
Let me ask you.

250
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,760
How much do you remember from the time

251
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,670
before we took you to Yunyin Mountain?

252
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,950
You don't remember, do you?

253
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,440
When your master and I saved you,

254
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,320
your hand was injured.

255
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,390
This injury on your wrist

256
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,190
caused you to have a high fever and fall unconscious.

257
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,270
When you woke up,

258
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,280
you lost most of your memory.

259
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,220
As for Xiangyi,

260
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,740
he was still a child.

261
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,490
He was not old enough to remember things,

262
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,060
so it's natural

263
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,910
he can't remember some things.

264
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,420
The Feng clan

265
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,900
have searched for Princess Xuan's descendant

266
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,620
for over a hundred years.

267
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,940
Until 20 years ago,

268
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,630
we learned that Princess Xuan's grandson

269
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,700
had a ten-year-old son

270
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,860
studying under Qi Mushan.

271
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,740
With this clue,

272
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,700
the royal Nanyin jade pendant,

273
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,310
and the mark on his body,

274
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,390
I welcomed back my master.

275
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,220
In the end, it's all wrong.

276
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,980

277
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,460
you are my true master.

278
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,710
This was why Shan Gudao's blood

279
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,470
didn't work on the Karmic Bug.

280
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,260
Only Li Lianhua's blood could destroy it.

281
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,830

00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,470
it's been ten years.

286
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,550
Do you know how much effort I put in?

287
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,990
What about you?

288
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,220
You just say it's a misunderstanding

289
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,330
and a joke.

290
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,490
I think you are the laughingstock.

Why should all the good things belong to you?

No one has ever competed with you.

294
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,250
It's just your own obsession.

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,890
He's my biological father, after all.

347
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,380
I still feel bad

348
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,830
seeing his tragic end.

349
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,740
If...

350
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,860
There's no if.

351
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,750
No need to look back.

352
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,160
Xiaobao,

353
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,410
you've improved a lot

354
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,670
through this journey.

355
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,310
Compared to back then,

356
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,440
when you were a kid

357
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,660
using a wooden sword

358
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,230
and claiming to be Li Xiangyi's student,

359
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,690
you're much stronger now.

360
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,680
As your teacher,

361
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
I am very pleased.

362
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,700
Stop taking advantage of me.

363
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm not your student.

364
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,000
You don't respect your master at all.

365
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,580
Then, Master,

366
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,660
what do you plan on doing now?

367
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,180
I need to find some pieces of wood

368
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,960
to repair my shabby building.

369
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,730
After repairing your shabby building,

370
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,460
what's next?

371
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,180
Director Di.

372
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,810
Director Di,

373
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,220
you need to fix your bad habit

374
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,480
of eavesdropping.

375
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,430
You've done everything you wanted to.

376
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,690
What’s your next plan?

377
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,940
From now on...

378
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,620
Look.

379
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,300
I'll find a place to get some sun.

380
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,230
I'll go fishing.

381
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,740
How comfortable!

382
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,390
I won't let you live such a carefree life.

383
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,190
Styx Flower.

384
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,370
First, it's to repay you.

385
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,610
Second, it's to remind you

386
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,090
that we have another battle.

387
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,330
I thought we're friends now.

388
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,450
So what if we're friends or foe?

389
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,410
Don’t try to cheat in our battle.

390
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,840
The Styx Flower and Yin and Yang leaves are all here.

391
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,630
The Yin Leaf is too strong alone.

392
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,840
You'll die from your Genuine Qi exploding.

393
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,140
If you take it with the Yang Leaf,

394
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,490
it can cure this aggressive effect

395
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,740
and remove the poison in your body

396
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
to save your life.

397
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,020
Director Di,

398
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,600
you searched for this all your life.

399
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,030
You're willing to give it to me?

400
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,230
See you at the East Sea

401
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,260
in half a month.

402
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,640
The great battle at the East Sea half a month later?

403
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,260
I was right.

404
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,700
Di Feisheng

405
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,230
is giving up on his own dream

406
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,330
for you to live on.

407
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,960
At least he has a conscience.

408
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,560
Li Lianhua,

409
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,510
after struggling for so long,

410
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,300
you finally have the Styx Flower.

411
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,500
Your poison can finally be detoxified.

412
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,460
The Styx Flower is indeed a magical cure,

413
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,620
but I've had the Bicha Poison

414
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,610
for many years.

415
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,390
The Styx Flower

416
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,790
has at most

417
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,660
a 30 percent chance to cure it.

418
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,350
Even 10 percent is a chance.

419
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,540
Let's go find Guan Hemeng now.

420
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,090
He must know how to use the Styx Flower.

421
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,660
Why should we find Guan Hemeng?

422
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,190
I'm a miracle physician, aren't I?

423
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,630
You...

424
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,380
But recently,

425
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,890
my internal power is unstable.

426
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,550
I need to adjust it

427
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,230
before the Styx Flower can be used.

428
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,670
Don't worry.

429
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,020
Fine.

430
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,690
It's indeed not good to feast after starving.

431
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,280
I'll put the Styx Flower away

432
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,500
so that you can recover in peace.

433
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,740
No.

434
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,150
I have to find a Thousand-gear Lock first.

435
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,290
This way, no one will try to steal the Styx Flower.

436
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,210
Don't worry.

437
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,460
With you guarding it,

438
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,520
no one can steal it.

439
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
We have to make sure nothing goes wrong

440
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,300
so that we can be more at ease.

441
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,590
I've thought about it.

442
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,100
After you detoxify the poison,

443
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,350
we'll solve all the mysterious cases

444
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,690
and explore the martial world together.

445
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,200
Come on.

446
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,020
To encourage you,

447
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,220
here's candy for you.

448
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,540
I wish you longevity

449
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,830
and for all illnesses to be cured.

450
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,380
Thanks.

451
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,410
I'll do it myself.

452
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,370
[Tianji Mountain Manor]

453
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,300
Mother.

454
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,500
You're finally back.

455
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,350
Yang is here too.

456
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,220
Fang.

457
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,200
Li.

458
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,900
Your father went to the palace to care for the emperor and still isn't back.

459
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,630
The seasons are changing soon.

460
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,870
I wonder if he brought enough clothes.

461
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,620
So,

462
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,100
Lord Yang was passing by.

463
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,980
I asked Lord Yang to bring some clothes

464
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,180
for your father.

465
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,660
Care for the emperor?

466
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,230
My father has been in the palace for this long?

467
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,980
Lord Yang,

468
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,700
how is His Majesty?

469
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,460
The Imperial Hospital gave many prescriptions.

470
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,980
His Majesty is getting better,

471
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,280
but he has been in low spirits.

472
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,880
He still needs to rest in bed.

473
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,690
Fortunately, several lords

474
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,350
are accompanying His Majesty these days.

475
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,540
It's just that Lord Fang will be unable

476
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,070
to leave the palace for now.

477
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,680
I have work to do,

478
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,300
so I’ll take my leave now.

479
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,450
Take care.

480
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,780
Yang.

481
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,680
Li.

482
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,310
Are you able to

483
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,570
bring people to see His Majesty in the palace?

484
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,640
Your Majesty, greetings from Fang Duobing.

485
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,940
Fang Duobing?

486
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,880
Official Fang,

487
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,270
you are a cultured and educated man.

488
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,640
How could you

489
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,390
name your son like this?

490
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,100
Your Majesty,

491
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,610
I wasn't home when he was born.

492
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,960
My wife said

493
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,530
he was sickly

494
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,860
and might not survive,

495
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,620
so she nicknamed him Duobing.

496
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,560
After that,

497
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,980
we never gave him an official name.

498
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,360
Official Fang, you are loyal to the country,

499
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,980
but you treat your wife and children so lightly.

500
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,180
It's inappropriate.

501
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,210
How dare you!

502
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,440
At this point,

503
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,250
you still dare to hide it from me?

504
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,490
Fang Duobing is the son

505
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,200
of the rebel, Shan Gudao.

506
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,570
Am I wrong?

507
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,480
Your Majesty.

508
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,350
My son didn't know much about his background before.

509
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,550
He has no connections with Shan Gudao.

510
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,710
Your Majesty.

511
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,680
I know my birth father, Shan Gudao, committed a grave crime.

512
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,750
As his son,

513
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,500
I can't escape punishment,

514
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,650
but this has nothing to do with the Fang family.

515
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,010
Your Majesty, please be just.

516
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,630
If you wish to punish someone,

517
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,200
please punish me alone.

518
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,810
I will accept it willingly

519
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,740
and without any complaints.

520
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,070
Father,

521
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,310
this isn't what you said before.

522
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,300
If it weren’t for Fang Duobing

523
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,810
and the others who came to help,

524
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,110
the consequences would've been unimaginable.

525
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,620
You can't punish the Fang family.

526
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,150
Silence.

527
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,060
Guards!

528
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,890
Take the princess and Minister Fang away.

529
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,710
Father.

530
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,740
Rise.

531
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

532
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,989
Fang Duobing,

533
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,320
you say you want me to punish you alone?

534
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,540
But you can't clear the others' crimes

535
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,230
just with your words.

536
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,199
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

537
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,719
I heard that the son of the Fang family

538
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,830
has improved greatly.

539
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,719
He solved many cases in the martial world.

540
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:41,699
Some of them are related to Nanyin.

541
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,690
Tell me in detail

542
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,489
and I will make my judgment.

543
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,139
Then I will recount everything I have seen and heard

544
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,270
from the beginning.

545
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,639
More than a hundred years ago,

546
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,050
Nanyin was destroyed,

547
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,540
but the imperial family's followers did not give up.

548
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,360
That's the whole story.

549
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,120
How did you know about this?

550
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,300
We started investigating after we discovered

551
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,470
the first Rama Heavenly Ice in Yuanbao Villa

552
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,260
and analyzed the clues step by step.

553
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,320
But we did not understand the full story

554
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,580
until we saw the murals

555
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,270
in the Pagoda of Bliss.

556
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,430
Fang Duobing.

557
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,490
You said you saw the murals in the abandoned pagoda,

558
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,390
but I've already sent someone to investigate it.

559
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,080
The abandoned palace has been flattened

560
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,640
and the vanished pagoda had not reappeared.

561
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,220
How can you prove

562
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,550
that you're telling the truth?

563
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,390
Ask His Majesty,

564
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,190
in the palace's recent murder case

565
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,720
that everyone knows about,

566
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,780
what was the cause

567
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,920
for the deaths of Lu Fang's group

568
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,840
and Liu Kehe?

569
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,460
Your Majesty,

570
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,550
there was a murder case in the palace

571
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,280
that caused a great commotion.

572
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,200
Have you found the cause for Lu Fang's group

573
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,640
and Supervisor Liu Kehe's death?

574
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
If you don't know,

575
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,760
I have an answer.

576
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,360
Lu Fang's group of four once found

577
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,190
a dried well filled with treasures in the palace

578
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,850
and mistook it as the legendary Pagoda of Bliss.

579
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,680
When Shan Gudao heard about this,

580
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
he became greedy.

581
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,200
He captured the four to seize the treasures

582
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,860
to strengthen the Wansheng Clan and dominate the martial arts world.

583
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,500
Fortunately, Supervisor Liu Kehe

584
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,900
discovered this in time.

585
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,340
He killed the four people

586
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,380
and protected the order in the palace,

587
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,860
but he died, unfortunately.

588
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,670
Shan Gudao's scheme failed

589
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,430
and was finally executed.

590
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,720
This is the truth of the Pagoda of Bliss

591
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,640
and will be the truth in historical records.

592
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,650
This is the whole truth of the Pagoda of Bliss case

593
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,260
and a truthful recount of everything I know.

594
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,540
Good.

595
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,230
This case was solved well.

596
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,370
I'm very satisfied.

597
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,500
Whether it's the Pagoda of Bliss,

598
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,510
or treasures,

599
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,240
this matter is over now.

600
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,940
If you leak a single word out,

601
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,690
I'll kill the entire Fang family.

602
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,790
Yes.

603
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,900
All right.

604
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,300
Ask your friend outside to come in.

605
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,510
Although I'm old,

606
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,010
my mind is still clear.

607
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,140
I pardon you for trespassing the palace this time.

608
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

609
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,470
Fang Duobing,

610
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,580
you may leave.

611
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,150
I want to speak to Li Lianhua alone.

612
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,660
Well...

613
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,770
[Imperial Study]

614
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,980
His Majesty's decree.

615
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,380
The Fang family and Tianji Hall Sect contributed to saving His Majesty.

616
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,250
Fang Zeshi, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue,

617
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,890
is loyal and virtuous.

618
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,100
He is granted a thousand acres of land

619
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,660
and ten thousand taels of gold.

620
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,810
Considering his contribution in accompanying the emperor,

621
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,400
he is allowed to leave the palace for a rest.

622
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

623
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,600
I knew Father would be a fair emperor.

624
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,910
Fang Zeshi's son, Fang Duobing, is wise and brave.

625
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,670
He is talented,

626
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,390
but his ambition is in the martial arts world

627
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,660
and doesn't like the court.

628
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,800
He is granted to travel around the world,

629
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,890
patrol the mountains and rivers for the emperor,

630
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,090
and settle the injustices in the world.

631
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,620
The marriage with Princess Zhaoling will be discussed another day.

632
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,300
Best regards.

633
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,430
I accept the decree.

634
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,000
Will be discussed another day?

635
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,490
Why does Father want to discuss it another day?

636
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,220
I'm going to argue with him now.

637
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,390
Princess.

638
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,000
Thank you for speaking up for me and the Fang family.

639
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,060
But with my current status,

640
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,040
it's no longer suitable for me

641
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,020
to interact more with you or the court.

642
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,260
Let's say

643
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,410
we are not meant to be.

644
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,290
Fang Duobing, you...

645
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,800
Fang Duobing.

646
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,350
Do you really love the martial world?

647
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,790
Yes.

648
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,530
What if

649
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,070
I can persuade Father?

650
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,050
Would you still be unwilling to stay in the palace for me

651
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,650
and be an official?

652
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,340
Since you don't like it,

653
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,850
I won't force you.

654
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,630
Leave.

655
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,650
I've set you free.

656
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,340
Take care.

657
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,060
Princess.

658
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,880
Who knows

659
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,150
what will happen in the future?

660
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,670
Don't forget your words.

661
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,700
Okay.

662
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,590
I'll wait for you.

663
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,260
When you've experienced enough of the martial world,

664
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,720
come back and be my prince.

His Majesty knows you are the son of Prince Fangji.

686
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,720
♫I'll write a poem about old friends departing with me♫

687
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,830
He didn't give you a hard time about it?

688
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,520
His Majesty is benevolent and kind.

689
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,960
♫It's just to choose♫

690
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,010
♫An ending that I like♫

691
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,540
He cares for the people.

692
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,670
He's a good emperor.

693
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,040
On the other hand, I'm just a dying man.

694
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,410
I'm nobody important to him.

695
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,950
♫Ask a question about the joys and sorrows of the lotus flower♫

696
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,020
Even a wise emperor

697
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,770
♫Break a sword and throw it into the mud♫

698
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,590
would not be softhearted

699
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,990
towards any possibility

700
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,990
that could affect his throne.

701
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,120
♫Only when you're over your worries♫

702
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,010
♫Can you live up to all beings♫

703
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,830
Alright, Fang Xiaobao.

704
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,580
You're right.

705
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,830
Actually, I told His Majesty

706
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,780
I took something from the Pagoda of Bliss.

707
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,380
If anything happens to us,

708
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,100
this friend

709
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,230
will reveal it to the public.

710
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,420
Nonsense.

711
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,510
When did you take anything from the Pagoda of Bliss?

712
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,240
You've fooled me so many times.

713
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,400
You still think I'll believe you?

714
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,870
You even dare to lie to His Majesty.

715
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,520
You're indeed

716
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,660
the Physician Li who can cure the dead.

717
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,160
Not bad.

718
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,390
You've grown up.

719
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,870
Look.

720
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,860
In this prosperous world,

721
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,560
everything is at peace now.

722
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,620
Let me ask you,

723
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,330
who is more suitable than him

724
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,750
to be the emperor?

725
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,310
Besides,

726
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,300
if I have time,

727
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,010
I have to repair my Lotus Tower

728
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,660
and plant all kinds of radish.

729
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,790
That would be great.

730
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,410
♫The long night accompanies the moon on the rooftop♫

731
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,570
After all this,

732
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,530
have you rested enough?

733
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,260
♫Push aside the clouds to count the stars♫

734
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,130
♫Old worries are so far away yet so close♫

735
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,450
When are you going to use Styx Flower for your poison?

736
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,140
♫Since ancient times, how many heroes could♫

737
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,870
This is the important matter.

738
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,190
There's no rush at all.

739

♫gamble their lives♫

740
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,230

♫to win against the odds of love♫

742
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,230
There's one more thing I need to resolve.

743
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,590
♫Ask a question about the joys and sorrows of the lotus flower♫

744

Here.

745
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:44,480
Drink.
