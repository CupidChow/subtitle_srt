00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,979
Your Highness.

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,560
Thank you.

5
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,710
Where is His Highness?

6
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,390
He hasn't recovered from his cold

7
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,520
and sent me to inspect the scene first.

00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,340
[Prince Jin's Mansion]

9
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,850
Yan Chi,

10
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,199
this day has finally come.

11
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,820
Open the gate.

12
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,780
No, Your Highness.

13
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,630
This concerns the late Prince Jin.

14
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,550
You need written approvals
from both the Supreme Court

15
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,680
and the Ministry of Justice
before you can open the gate.

16
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,490
Your Highness, please don't.

17
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,500
This is the mansion
of a convicted traitor.

18
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,160
Breaking the seals without permission

19
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,350
is tantamount
to challenging the imperial authority.

20
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,770
His Majesty granted me the authority
to serve as a Ministry of Justice officer.

21
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,230
His Highness ordered me
to examine the body.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,790
How am I acting without permission?

23
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,070
If His Majesty is displeased,

24
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,180
I'll take full responsibility myself.

25
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,560
Prefect Zheng, Constable Zhan,

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,050
just proceed as usual.

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,250
-Yes.
-Yes.

28
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,110
Where is the thief?

29
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,900
Bring him over.

30
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,680
Yes!

31
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,770
Move!

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,750
Tell Her Highness honestly

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,210
what happened last night.

34
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,579
I heard at the gambling house

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,370
that when Prince Jin's Mansion

36
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,870
was sealed,

37
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,800
the servants buried many treasures
in the backyard.

38
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,579
So I thought

39
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,910
I'd sneak in at night and try my luck.

40
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,380
The soil here

41
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,130
looked fresher than the rest,

42
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,190
so I...

43
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,280
Greetings, Minister Li, Prefect Zheng.

44
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,840
I tore off the seals.

45
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,630
Minister Li, if you want to punish me,

46
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll go with you to the Supreme Court.

47
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,730
You misunderstand.

48
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,820
I'm here

49
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:04,650
because of the skeleton
that suddenly turned up too.

50
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,900
As for the seals,

51
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,970
even if you hadn't removed them,

52
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,720
I'd have

53
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,150
removed them myself.

54
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,190
When

55
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,040
Prince Jin's Mansion was confiscated,

56
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,230
I had it thoroughly searched.

57
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,510
There was no chance
a body could've been hidden here.

58
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,480
Yet a year later,

59
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,210
a skeleton suddenly appeared.

60
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,640
I'll get to the bottom of this.

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,060
But I don't like people interfering
with my work,

62
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,680
and I'm not used to working with others,

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,480
not even with the Supreme Court.

64
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,040
Your forensic skills are unmatched.

65
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
As long as you keep me updated

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,870
on the findings

67
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,030
so I can report to His Majesty,

68
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,170
that will be enough.

69
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,480
He's not stopping me
from examining the body?

70
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,700
I've just finished
the initial examination.

71
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,900
The deceased is male,

72
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,760
likely between 20 and 23 years old.

73
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,830
He was about six feet eight inches tall.

74
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,350
Adipocere has formed on the body.

75
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,430
So the death occurred

76
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,650
over a year ago.

77
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,390
What's the cause of death?

78
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,860
There's an indentation on the sternum.

79
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,390
He was likely stabbed in the heart

80
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,630
with a two-inch-wide blade from the front.

81
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,960
A two-inch-wide blade?

82
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,930
A sword

83
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,630
or a dagger?

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,630
To determine the exact cause of death,

85
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,430
further examination is needed.

86
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,830
The man was very tall,

87
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,000
with facial features

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,260
far more defined than the Zhou people's.

89
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,500
He appears to have foreign blood.

90
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,460
Li Muyun

91
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,460
is indeed no ordinary person.

92
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,550
I can't let him near this body again.

93
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,710
Minister Li, your insight is razor-sharp.

94
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,720
No wonder you're Lord Shen's top disciple.

95
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,610
In that case,

96
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,800
I'll stay out of it

97
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,840
and leave this matter to you.

98
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,850
Please don't be angry, Your Highness.

99
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,120
I didn't mean to act like

100
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,150
I knew about forensics better than you.

101
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,110
Your Highness,

102
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,720
the official duty comes first.

103
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,650
Forgive my recklessness.

104
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,720
Since it's an official duty,

105
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,270
I can't decline it.

106
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,770
Prefect Zheng,

107
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,570
please have this skeleton
moved to the morgue.

108
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,790
Without my permission,

109
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,920
no one is to enter.

110
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,800
Yes.

111
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,130
Zhan Yang.

112
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,310
I

113
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,280
haven't heard the title "Prince Jin"
in a long time.

114
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,870
It's my fault, Your Majesty.

115
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,580
Rise. This isn't your fault.

116
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,800
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

117
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,480
However, since this matter

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
involves Prince Jin,

119
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,310
you'll need to

120
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,810
investigate it thoroughly.

121
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,620
Listen,

122
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,710
put this matter on hold for now.

123
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,070
Wan, there's no need to rush the autopsy.

124
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,390
Right now,

125
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,620
the Empress Dowager has just recovered

126
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,760
and wishes to go on a spring outing.

127
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,040
Here's what we'll do—

128
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,310
everything can wait

129
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,530
until after the Double Third Festival.

130
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,210
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

131
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,990
You may go.

132
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,890
Princess Yongci, you stay.

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,840
Wan,

134
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,670
during the Double Third Festival,

135
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,930
spend more time with the Empress Dowager

136
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,720
and the Grand Princess.

137
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,980
Don't mention

138
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,650
anything about Prince Jin,

139
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,150
lest it bring back painful memories.

140
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,290
Understood, Your Majesty.

141
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,520
You've always been sensible.

142
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,910
I trust you.

143
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,360
Now that your mourning period is over,

144
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,360
it's time you thought about your marriage.

145
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,670
I'm in no rush, Your Majesty.

146
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,990
You may not be,

147
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,300
but I'm afraid

148
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,200
someone else is.

149
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,440
Well,

150
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,690
if someone

151
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,049
catches your eye during the outing,

152
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,370
just go ahead

153
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,909
and tell the Empress Dowager.

154
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:52,520
She and I

155
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:53,970
will make the arrangements for you.

156
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,620
Yes.

157
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,320
I take my leave.

158
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,780
Your Majesty,

159
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,430
you truly care about
the Heir of Prince Rui.

160
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,700
Wan

161
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,850
doesn't have powerful family support.

162
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,400
If Yan Chi

163
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,460
turns out to be more obedient
than his father,

164
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,390
then letting this marriage happen

165
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,210
wouldn't be a bad thing.

166
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,470
How can you?

167
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,090
How can you let me and the soldiers

168
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,510
who've followed you for years
go die for nothing

169
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,000
just because of your personal vow?

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,270
This isn't fate.

171
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,970
It's pure stupidity!

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,790
Get out!

173
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't have a cowardly son like you!

174
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Like this.

175
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,010
Blow again.

176
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,230
Come on,

177
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,130
have some tea.

178
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,590
With Wan around,

179
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,520
he looks so happy.

180
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,140
Yeah.

181
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,170
I just wonder

182
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,260
when Sui

183
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,760
will return to how he used to be.

184
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,320
He's still young.

185
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,000
When he grows older,

186
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,420
everything will be fine.

187
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,880
I hope so.

188
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,380
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

189
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
If you ask me,

190
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,860
Sui is a blessed kid.

191
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,930
He'll surely turn misfortune
into a blessing

192
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,460
and find luck in adversity.

193
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,880
Speaking of blessings,

194
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,220
Sister-in-law,

195
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,780
have you heard about this?

196
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,960
Prince Yu

197
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,160
married 11 women,

198
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,870
and one of them bore him twins
—a boy and a girl.

199
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,790
I must say

200
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,580
I'm truly impressed.

201
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,110
He's spent most of his life

202
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,630
indulging in pleasure,

203
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,960
and now in his old age,
he married a beauty

204
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,220
and even fathered a son.

205
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,950
Just imagine how many people are
green with envy.

206
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,270
A boy and a girl?

207
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:36,770
Yeah.

208
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,760
What a blessing.

209
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,830
He is blessed,

210
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,630
but I think

211
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,490
no one in this world

212
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,920
is more blessed than you.

213
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,870
Think about it.

214
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,460
His Majesty is wise and filial,

215
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,880
Prince Rui is

216
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,280
remarkably valiant,

217
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,950
and you have Wan

218
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,410
always by your side.

219
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,780
What more could you possibly ask for?

220
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,390
Now look at me—

221
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,670
all my life,

222
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,170
I only had one child, Qiong.

223
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,220
Shouldn't I be crying my heart out?

224
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,000
Gosh,

225
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,350
as you've gotten older,

226
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
you've become such a smooth talker.

227
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,210
-Sui.
-Grandmother.

228
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,870
Let me see.

229
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,670
Blow.

230
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,690
Wonderful.

231
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Grow up strong, alright?

232
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,150
Wan,

233
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,540
what has Chi been busy with lately?

234
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,310
I haven't seen him at the palace for days.

235
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,620
If he doesn't show up soon,

236
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,690
I might have to
start looking for suitors for you.

237
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,310
Whether he shows up or not,

238
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,890
I'm not meeting any suitors.

239
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,470
Look at her.

240
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,650
Just like that,

241
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
you're already speaking your mind.

242
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,360
Wan is being so forthright now.

243
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,820
If Chi doesn't come
to ask for her hand soon,

244
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,180
I won't let him marry Wan anymore.

245
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,060
Exactly.

246
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,010
It's decided.

247
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,150
It's decided.

248
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,600
Yan Chi,

249
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,950
you must return safely.

250
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,520
Qi.

251
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,640
Qi,

252
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,800
I have all the royal families
in the capital

253
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,440
under surveillance.

254
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,290
Just say the word,

255
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,290
and I can even

256
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,560
tell you how much rice

257
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,260
each family eats every day.

258
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,830
All I ask is that you speak to His Majesty
on my behalf

259
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,320
to betroth

260
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,880
Princess Yongning to me
during the Double Third Festival.

261
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,640
Why don't you turn to my mother?

262
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,600
She's your aunt, after all.

263
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
But she cares for you the most, Qi.

264
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,000
As long as you say the word,

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,130
it's as good as done.

266
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,200
Yongning's got a fiery temper.

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,930
She's not that easy to control.

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,250
Aren't you afraid

269
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
you might live to be the groom

270
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,810
but not survive the wedding night?

271
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,450
I'll just knock her out
with some knockout powder

272
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,380
and consummate the marriage first.

273
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,590
If she dares act up afterward,

274
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,580
I'll just divorce her.

275
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,630
If I can't,

276
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,320
I'll send her to a temple.

277
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,100
So much for your magnanimity.

278
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,940
Qi,

279
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,290
I'm not someone destined
for great things like you.

280
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,020
I don't need to be magnanimous.

281
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,110
Qi,

282
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,110
about my request…

283
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,420
You want my help?

284
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,630
Fine.

285
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,670
Help me with something first.

286
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,670
Anything you say.

287
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,500
No, no, Qi, I can't.

288
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,310
You know,

289
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,990
Yan Chi guards those he cares for
like a wolf.

290
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,270
If he finds out,

291
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,550
I'm done for.

292
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,480
He's not in the capital.

293
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,000
When he finds out,

294
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,450
it'll be too late.

295
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,760
You're right.

296
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,540
Li,

297
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,520
during a hunt,

298
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,890
do you remember

299
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,670
what you must keep in mind?

300
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,460
Don't act on your own.

301
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,790
Don't enter the dense forest alone.

302
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,730
Don't…

303
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,050
Don't…

304
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,070
Don't pursue wounded beasts alone.

305
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,340
Che is right.

306
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,240
Your Majesty,
if there's anything you don't know,

307
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,320
just ask Che.

308
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,770
You really are

309
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,070
a child who never grows up.

310
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,650
All you do is fool around.

311
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,620
Your Majesty,

312
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,120
if I'm a child,

313
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,250
what does that make Che and Chi?

314
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,410
You silly boy.

315
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,320
I'll go check over there.

316
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,910
Your Highness,

317
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,380
General Jiang ordered me to inform you

318
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,710
that Yan Chi has left Shuoxi.

319
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,640
It's about time.

320
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,080
Excellent.

321
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,750
Proceed as planned.

322
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,080
Yes.

323
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,070
Qi…

324
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,060
Qi,

325
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,690
what are you doing here?

326
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,040
Who was that just now?

327
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,100
The less you ask,
the longer you live.

328
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,230
How's the task I gave you coming along?

329
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,350
All set and ready.

330
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,470
I'm just waiting

331
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
on your word.

332
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,370
What's the rush?

333
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,890
With something like this,

334
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,960
you have to take your time
to make the most of it.

335
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,700
That boy Xue Qingshan

336
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,920
just happens to be on duty today.

337
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,900
When we walk by,

338
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,060
you two

339
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,770
can get a good look at him.

340
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,400
I know you have a good eye.

341
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,940
Greetings, Marquise of Wu'an.

342
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,740
Now, he's just

343
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,730
a seventh-rank lieutenant,

344
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,180
but he has limitless potential.

345
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,300
Seventh rank?

346
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,609
How is that any better
than a low-ranking soldier?

347
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,590
Xiang,

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,070
what do you think?

349
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,230
I'll go along with whatever you decide.

350
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,600
My marriage

351
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,160
is mine to decide.

352
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,290
No one else gets to decide for me.

353
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,990
Forgive my rudeness.

354
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,660
I know a bit about injuries.

355
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,730
Maybe I can help.

356
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,030
May I?

357
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,140
Luckily, the bone's not broken.

358
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,700
It's nothing serious.

359
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,110
Sir,

360
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,550
have you seen my aunt,

361
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,750
the Marquise of Zhongyong, or my sister?

362
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,560
Just now,

363
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,600
the Marquise of Wu'an

364
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,110
and two other ladies entered the woods.

365
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,520
I'm not sure if the Marquise of Zhongyong
was among them.

366
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,380
Thank you, sir.

367
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,950
Are you going to them?

368
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,300
I can help you there.

369
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,600
No need.

370
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,150
I can go by myself later.

371
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,390
Farewell.

372
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,000
Wait.

373
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:03,970
This…

374
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,960
It's dirty here.

375
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,050
Thank you.

376
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,160
-Greetings, Father.
-Greetings, Father.

377
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,170
Send the order.

378
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,140
Begin the competition.

379
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,750
Yes.

380
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,490
Che,

381
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,680
after you.

382
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,310
If I could marry

383
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,000
someone like Prince Cheng,

384
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,850
that would be wonderful.

385
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,890
What?

386
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,950
Your Majesty,

387
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,770
the two princes ended in a draw.

388
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,030
Did I hear that right?

389
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,740
Che drew with Qi?

390
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,920
You heard right.

391
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,380
Che understands the importance
of both civil and martial skills.

392
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,090
He's been practicing archery

393
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,130
and never slacked off.

394
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,730
If Qi

395
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,990
had put in half the effort
His Highness does,

396
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,780
he wouldn't have scored so poorly today.

397
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,300
Send the order.

398
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,790
The one who hits the target
will be rewarded.

399
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,510
Yes.

400
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,010
Che,

401
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,680
if your arms are getting tired,

402
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,040
don't force yourself.

403
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,260
What do you mean by that?

404
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,930
After a few more shots,

405
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,750
you won't be able to
draw your bow anymore.

406
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,900
Then that leading goose

407
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,060
will be mine.

408
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,610
Despicable!

409
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,190
Thank you for your praise, Che.

410
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,630
Your Majesty.

411
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,720
Your Majesty,

412
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,100
he shot both eyes

413
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,710
with a single arrow.

414
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,290
Both eyes were shot.

415
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,920
I, Yan Chi,

416
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,350
am late due to illness.

417
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,460
Please forgive me.

418
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,880
It's good

419
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,160
that you made it.

420
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,830
Being late isn't a grave offense.

421
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,990
Get up, get up.

422
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,230
Since the Empress Dowager said it's fine,

423
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,990
you may rise.

424
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

425
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,000
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

426
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,920
So,

427
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,890
it was you who shot it down?

428
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,340
I saw two arrows vying
for the leading goose

429
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,450
and worried it might get away,

430
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,450
so I took the shot.

431
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,150
Why did you use a whistling arrow?

432
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,590
A whistling arrow

433
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,050
is meant to warn,

434
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,310
not to kill.

435
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,870
Your Majesty just promised a reward.

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,860
Hope you're not taking that back.

437
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,350
Yan Chi, Heir of Prince Rui,

438
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,270
a master archer who fights evil

439
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,470
and upholds justice,

440
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,850
is hereby awarded 1,000 taels of gold.

441
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

442
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,660
"Fights evil and upholds justice."

443
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,740
Father truly has a discerning eye.

444
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,220
Wan.

451
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,410
You were gone so long.

452
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,770
Did everything go well?

453
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,150
There's something

454
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
I need to tell you.

455
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,920
What is it?

456
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,810
His Majesty hopes Father will voluntarily
hand over the military command of Shuoxi.

457
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,810
But Father...

458
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,440
His Lordship wouldn't listen to you?

459
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,170
He wouldn't.

460
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,360
He fears that if he gives up command now,
the nomadic enemies will attack us.

461
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,960
He insists on
crushing them completely first.

462
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,660
But I doubt His Majesty
can wait that long.

463
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,840
If His Majesty insists on
reclaiming command,

464
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,500
does the Prince plan to rebel?

465
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,990
How could you say something so treasonous?

466
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,950
I'm serious.

467
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,290
If His Majesty reclaims military control,

468
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,000
in the end,

469
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,510
either you and the Prince are
stripped of rank,

470
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,760
and I work as a physician to support us,

471
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,360
or

472
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,400
the Prince rises up with the Shuoxi Army,

473
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,350
and His Majesty kills us both
to intimidate the rebels.

474
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,150
We have to prepare for the worst.

475
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,420
Did you just say "us"?

476
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,890
Even if I lose my title and rank,

477
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,360
even if I lose my life for this,

478
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,560
you'd still marry me?

479
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,160
Until death

480
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,160
do us part.

481
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,560
Master,

482
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,780
I have urgent news.

483
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,680
Go ahead.

484
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,270
On the marriage list Noble Consort Su
gave the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

485
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,900
the bride listed for Prince Cheng is
Miss Qin.

486
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,290
I was afraid of causing a commotion,

487
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,020
so I didn't dare steal the list.

488
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,560
I await your instructions.

489
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,600
There's no way Prince Cheng
truly wants to marry me.

490
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,950
We mustn't act rashly.

491
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,090
Don't worry.

492
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,830
Whatever scheme he's planning,

493
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,400
I won't let him get his way.

494
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,650
I'll await your good news.

495
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,150
You

496
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,990
traveled day and night to come back.

497
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,180
I appreciate it.

498
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,700
I would gladly give my life

499
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,550
in Your Majesty's service.

500
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,040
Then tell me,

501
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,920
how did

502
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,040
the mission go?

503
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,040
Your Majesty,

504
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,640
there is more
to the military provision case

505
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,510
than it seems.

506
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,150
By the time I arrived in Shuoxi,

507
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,480
Prince Rui had dismissed and detained
the grain official who colluded

508
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,980
with the transport commissioner.

509
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,720
During the interrogation, I discovered

510
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,400
that it was a local official
from Liangzhou

511
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,450
who introduced the two.

512
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,370
Fearing I might alert them,

513
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,540
I didn't dare pursue it without orders.

514
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,100
But this is enough to prove

515
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,540
that the Shuoxi Army was

516
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,680
the victim in the military provision case.

517
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,800
Prince Rui never condoned corruption

518
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,440
or bribed officials as alleged.

519
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
There is someone else behind it all.

520
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,830
Your Majesty,

521
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,810
from what I personally saw

522
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,810
and heard,

523
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,540
Prince Rui is wholly loyal to Zhou

524
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,040
and utterly devoted to Your Majesty.

525
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,410
The Shuoxi Army

526
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,840
belongs to Your Majesty.

527
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,910
It's the wall that protects Zhou.

528
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,780
I

529
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,570
am Prince Rui's only son.

530
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,120
If Your Majesty still has doubts,

531
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,290
you may imprison me.

532
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,570
If Prince Rui disobeys,

533
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,160
you can cut off one of my limbs.

534
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,270
If that's not enough,

535
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,030
you may take my head

536
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,130
and send it to Shuoxi

537
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,860
as a warning to the entire army.

538
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,010
Don't talk nonsense.

539
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,080
Sorry.

540
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,160
You said just now

541
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,640
you didn't dare investigate
the Liangzhou official.

542
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,850
That means whoever's behind this

543
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,940
must be quite powerful.

544
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,420
There's no concrete proof yet.

545
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,760
I dare not speculate.

546
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,210
Your Majesty,

547
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,680
please give me a bit more time.

548
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,160
I'll get to the bottom of this

549
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,350
and personally bring

550
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,960
the one behind it before you.

551
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,090
How many people out there

552
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
could have influence
over both the Ministry of Revenue

553
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,770
and the Ministry of War?

554
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,000
Enough.

555
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm aware of the situation now.

556
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,510
You may leave now.

557
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,890
Your Majesty,

558
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,680
there's one more matter.

559
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,480
Your Majesty,

560
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,910
the Empress and the Noble Consort
request an audience.

561
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,960
Wait inside the tent.

562
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
We'll talk later.

563
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,480
Yes.

564
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,570
Your Majesty,

565
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,190
you must help Qi and me.

566
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,960
The Palace Domestic Service
has humiliated us.

567
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,920
None of the young ladies
they selected for him

568
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,980
come from families as distinguished

569
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,680
as Lady Yu of the Qin family.

570
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,290
My poor son,

571
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,030
he can never measure up
to the Crown Prince.

572
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,360
It's all my fault. I'm so useless

573
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,840
and have always been overshadowed
since I entered the palace.

574
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,900
If you and Qi

575
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,210
have any noble lady in mind,

576
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,630
you can make the decision yourselves.

577
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,560
Just report it
to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

578
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,570
This matter

579
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,880
still needs Her Majesty's approval.

580
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,940
I'm not sure if she'll permit it.

581
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,920
No need for that.

582
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,400
I approve of it.

583
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,290
Thank you, Your Majesty.

584
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,730
Her Highness is so good at this.

585
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,840
Amazing!

586
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,410
Excellent!

587
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,080
Why aren't you applauding?

588
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,880
Princess Yongning,

589
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,740
Your Highness,

590
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,360
may I have a word with you?

591
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,910
Everyone, enjoy yourselves.

592
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,020
Come on.

593
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,330
Princess Yongci is feeling a bit tired.

594
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,790
She'd like to return and rest early.

595
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,140
So, Princess Yongning,

596
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,220
please go back to the tent
and get some rest as well.

597
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,820
Oh, right,

598
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,410
Her Highness specifically asked

599
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,540
Lord Li

600
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,430
to look after Princess Yongning.

601
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,030
Since it's a request from Wan,

602
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,130
I guess I'll take the trouble.

603
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,040
No need.

604
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,090
It's not like my sword can't kill.

605
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,150
Bringing him along

606
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,600
would just slow me down.

607
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
I may be a burden,

608
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,000
but I'm not useless.

609
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,200
I can talk

610
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,460
and entertain people.

611
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,160
I'd never ignore people

612
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,270
like someone did.

613
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,510
And I can walk

614
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,970
without needing support.

615
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,080
I don't fight well,

616
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,010
but my eyesight is decent.

617
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,890
At least I can take a hit or two for you.

618
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,240
Yan Li,

619
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,480
I don't mind you joking about me,

620
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,000
but if you joke about Ze,

621
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,750
I swear I'll cut you down!

622
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,600
I'm sure

623
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,280
that's not what Lord Li meant,

624
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,140
right?

625
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,600
Take it.

626
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,390
That's exactly what I meant.

627
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,290
If you marry Ze,
that's as good as killing me.

628
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,420
Sooner or later,

629
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,380
I'll die anyway.

630
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,480
So I'll say it straight today—

631
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,050
I won't let you marry Ze.

632
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,730
It's not going to happen!

633
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,850
I won't have to marry him.

634
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,960
As long as I can find him a woman

635
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,490
who truly cares for him,

636
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,240
there's no need for me to step in.

637
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,770
Why didn't you say so earlier?

638
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,880
Matchmaking is my specialty.

639
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,030
Background, character, talent—

640
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,390
I'll handpick the best of the best
for him.

641
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,230
What about looks?

642
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,590
She can't be worse-looking than me.

643
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,710
He can't see.

644
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,690
But I can.

645
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,590
Now you're being unreasonable.

646
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,210
How am I supposed to find anyone

647
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,610
better looking than you?

648
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,670
Why are you smiling?

649
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,560
Alright, alright.

650
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,220
I'll go look tomorrow.

651
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,690
Bai Feng.

652
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,660
You're my witness.

653
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
If I find someone,

654
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,190
she can't go back on her word.

655
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,700
Your Highnesses,

656
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,490
I'm not witnessing anything.

657
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,760
I need to hurry back
and stand night watch for Her Highness.

658
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,510
I'll take my leave now.

659
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,600
Why don't you start looking now?

660
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,110
It's too dark.

661
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,830
I can't find anyone pretty.

662
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,960
I can't see clearly.

663
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,930
Didn't you just say your eyesight's great?

664
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,350
I went blind just now.

665
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,699
Are they sent by Prince Cheng?

666
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,850
Master.

667
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,550
You may leave.

668
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

669
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,270
Hurry.

670
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,080
Get up.

671
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,550
Careful, careful.

672
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,220
Your face is dirty.

673
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,410
Let me clean it for you.

674
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,270
Who are you?

675
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,580
Don't move.

676
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,580
What drug are you using on me?

677
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,890
You mean this?

678
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,010
That's what the Fengqi House uses
to train their girls.

679
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,690
It keeps you awake

680
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,100
but makes your whole body go limp.

681
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,780
You can only lie there
and let me do what I want.

682
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
What can you get out of this?

683
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,330
I heard

684
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,780
you and Yongning are
as close as real sisters.

685
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,050
Tell me,

686
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,890
if I get intimate with you…

687
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,610
Who's there?

688
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,560
Qi?

689
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,070
You definitely have a death wish.

690
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,430
How dare you lay hands

691
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,800
on the girl I want?

692
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,350
Qi,

693
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,610
you're really planning to marry her?

694
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,470
She's a coroner.

695
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
She'd bring you nothing but bad luck.

696
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,410
Just have some fun with her.

697
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,020
You're not even worthy of

698
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,600
touching my dog,

699
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,480
let alone the girl I want.

700
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,010
Understand?

701
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,190
Qi,

702
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,990
the Noble Consort is my aunt.

703
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,250
We're related.

704
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,650
Aren't you being a bit too harsh?

705
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,960
Related?

706
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,230
I'm a royal prince.

707
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,510
Who are you to be related
to the royal family?

708
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,990
Yan Qi,

709
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,650
you're not even the Crown Prince yet,

710
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,280
and you're already
turning your back on me?

711
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,850
If it weren't for the money

712
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,080
and manpower from the Feng family,

713
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,080
you and your mother

714
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,420
would've died in the palace long ago!

715
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,670
When you came to me for money,

716
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,650
why didn't you call me unworthy?

717
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,440
Good.

718
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,960
Perfect.

719
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,920
He's much less

720
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,800
annoying now, isn't he?

721
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,480
You've lost your mind.

722
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,400
This place is dirty now.

723
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,440
Let's talk somewhere else.

724
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,320
Was the campsite

725
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,230
arranged by the Patrol Battalion?

726
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,840
Yes.

727
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,390
Most of its men work for Prince Cheng.

728
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,670
Check who's absent tonight.

729
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,510
No need for confessions.

730
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,370
Just kill them.

731
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,310
Yes.

732
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,730
Also,

733
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,340
the kidnapping of Her Highness

734
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,490
must be kept secret.

735
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,150
Master,

736
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,860
Her Highness wasn't kidnapped.

737
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,520
She went missing
while learning to hunt with me.

738
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,250
The Tianshu Camp's knockout powder.

739
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:50,830
Hurry!

740
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,690
It's herbal powder.

741
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,100
Wan.

742
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,220
So?

743
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,550
Are you satisfied

744
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,960
with the setup?

745
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,170
I rarely put such effort

746
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,030
into pleasing a woman.

747
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,560
You're truly different.

748
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,720
Not screaming or making a fuss.

749
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
So composed.

750
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,310
It actually makes me

751
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,560
start to like you.

752
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,790
Why not

753
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,700
become my primary consort?

754
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,510
You want me to be your primary consort

755
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,370
just because you need my talents.

756
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,370
I could help you
boost your political standing,

757
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,630
and as the Marquis of Zhongyong's niece,

758
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,070
I could help you drive a wedge
between the Qin family

759
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,270
and the Crown Prince.

760
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,170
Do you think

761
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,850
I'm the kind of coward
who climbs up by using women?

762
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,440
Aren't you?

763
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,750
You're treating me like this

764
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,590
only because Yan Chi

765
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,120
humiliated you in front of everyone.

766
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,440
You can't defeat him fair and square,

767
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,190
so you're trying to bully me

768
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,920
to vent your frustration.

769
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,400
Shut up. I'm warning you!

770
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,280
So not only are you a coward
who rides women's coattails,

771
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,710
you're also the kind who picks on the weak

772
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,430
to feel like a man.

773
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,200
Now you know

774
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,390
I'm not gentle with women, don't you?

775
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,260
If it hurts, cry.

776
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,130
If you're scared, beg me.

777
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,920
I can be very patient

778
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,090
with women who please me.

779
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,010
I'm scared of snakes.

780
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,400
But does that mean
I should beg a snake not to bite me?

781
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,280
If you don't even understand that,

782
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,130
you're not just a coward—

783
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,590
you're also a fool.

784
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,360
Great.

785
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,920
What a sharp tongue.

786
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,600
But save that sharp tongue of yours

787
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,550
for Yan Chi.

788
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,990
I'd love to see

789
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,590
the look on his face

790
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,720
after I strip you naked

791
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,600
and have my way with you.

792
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,520
It'll definitely be very interesting.

793
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,410
By then,

794
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,600
when the commoners talk about you,

795
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,840
they'll call you, Princess Yongci,

796
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,000
a tainted woman.

797
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,390
Living

798
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,590
will be your greatest torment.

799
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,290
After death,

800
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,900
the flesh and organs

801
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,790
rot into a pool of filth
in less than 10 days.

802
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,840
You may think teeth are hard,

803
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,960
but they fall out
within a couple of weeks,

804
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,980
just like your power
and hollow reputation.

805
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,710
They're the first to fade away.

806
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,610
The hair seems soft,

807
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,840
but it won't decay even after 100 years.

808
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,760
Like one's virtues and talent—

809
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,280
no one can take them away.

810
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,280
So I'd like to see

811
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,260
whether I'll be broken
by these petty things

812
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,630
or you'll fall from grace first

813
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,670
and be remembered in infamy.

814
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,880
I'll kill you!

815
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,310
Are you alright?

816
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,060
I'm fine.

817
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,750
Yan Chi,

818
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,260
how dare you attack me?

819
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,650
What do you want to do?

820
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,800
You're gonna kill me?

821
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,390
Yan Chi.

822
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:27,970
Yan Chi.
