3
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,390
These are all precious jewelry.

4
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,039
Each piece was personally
designed and commissioned

5
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,700
by the Heavenly Lord himself.

6
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,070
The materials used are extremely valuable.

7
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,730
There are 108 pieces in total.

8
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,430
My Lady, please see
if the count is correct.

9
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,530
My Lady, aren't you curious

10
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,150
who these accessories are for?

11
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
You didn't invite me here

12
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,500
just to count the items, did you?

13
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,110
I'd like you to listen to a story.

14
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,360
A story?

15
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,620
It's about a devoted man

16
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,390
who fell in love with a woman
he shouldn't have.

17
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,420
That's the Divine Lord Siling.

18
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,950
Doesn't she look a lot like you?

19
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,570
What are you trying to do?

20
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,270
What can I do?

21
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,430
I just want you to see clearly

22
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,900
who you owe

23
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
for your good life in Danxia Land.

24
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,520
When the world was still in chaos,

25
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,250
the Primordial God created
two strands of true energy:

26
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,079
one pure and one turbid,

27
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,690
one yin and one yang,

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,290
one cold and one hot.

29
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,579
They became Heavenly Lord Dacheng
and Divine Lord Siling.

30
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,079
They were born with the universe and
would live as long as the sun and moon.

31
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,750
They had fought for

32
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,050
as long as this world had existed.

33
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,590
For millions of years in the past,

34
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,150
they fought evenly, with no clear winner.

35
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,030
Unfortunately,

36
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,680
the Heavenly Lord made a mistake
he shouldn't have.

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,890
He fell in love with Siling.

38
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,090
How ridiculous!

39
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,700
He fell in love with his destined enemy.

40
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,810
The Heavenly Lord joyously
wanted to be with her.

41
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,630
But Siling took the poisoned Hanlin Dagger

42
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,360
and stabbed the Heavenly Lord.

43
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,640
It shattered his heart and meridians.

44
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,600
She took this chance to seal
the Heavenly Lord

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,590
and stole all of his power.

46
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,800
After that,

47
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,130
she became the most powerful being
in the Nine Heavens.

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,690
From then on, she conquered and killed,

49
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,290
seizing the artifacts
of many immortal sects,

50
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,720
angering the heavens and the people.

51
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,480
Fortunately, the Heavenly Lord
was blessed.

52
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,880
Rescued by a kind person,

53
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,100
he was able to break the seal and
return to Danxia Land.

54
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,490
He fought Siling until her
primordial spirit fled.

55
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,360
Since then,

56
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,830
Siling could only live

57
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,430
like a maggot in a gutter,

58
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,659
relying on her remnant soul to hide in
the mortal realm for the rest of her life.

59
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,120
My Lady, after hearing this story,

60
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,440
do you have any questions?

61
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,150
You're trying to sow discord between
me and the Heavenly Lord.

62
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,560
I can't make up a story like this.

63
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,920
My Lady, you can go to Canglei Palace

64
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,590
and ask any elder there.

65
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,390
Then you'll know if it's true or false.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,790
Even if the story is true,

67
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,110
you still told it to sow discord.

68
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,920
The grudge between
the Heavenly Lord and Siling

69
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,870
is a thing of the past.

70
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,400
It has nothing to do with me.

71
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
I won't let the past

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,520
ruin the present and future.

73
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,770
Then I hope you get what you desire,

74
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,090
always stay clear-headed and rational,

75
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,040
and never fall into confusion or jealousy.

76
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,830
I have other matters to attend to.

77
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,890
I'll leave this place to you, My Lady.

78
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,090
Oh, My Lady.

79
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,290
You've found out.

80
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,300
I had originally planned to keep you
here for a few more days,

81
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,330
but now you're asking for death.

82
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,270
You think I'll let you chase me around

83
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,190
like last time?

84
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,050
Take root!

85
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,520
Where do you think you're going?

86
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,070
Yun, strike!

87
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,630
Good wine, truly fine.

88
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,130
-Fill it up.

89

Please.

90
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,659
Oh, no.

91
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,060
Looks like I've come to the wrong place.

92
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,450
I can't be trapped here.

93
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,700
I need to find a way to get out quickly.

94
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,750
What a sinister place.

95
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,300
Who's there? Who's crying?

96
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,650
Who are you?

97
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,060
This place is so sinister.

98
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,510
Why is a child like you here?

99
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,550
Miss,

100
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,390
did you also get lost and end up here?

101
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,470
Lost?

102
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,320
I was going home with my dad
after chopping wood.

103
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,760
But somehow,

104
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
a thick fog came over the mountains.

105
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,450
When I opened my eyes,
I found myself here.

106
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
And my dad is gone too.

107
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,050
You're from the mortal realm?

108
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,330
My dad often says

109
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,150
that children who don't behave

110
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,000
will be caught by demons
and locked up in the forest,

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,950
then eaten one by one.

112
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,390
Did I get brought here

113
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,790
because I didn't behave?

114
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,480
Don't cry.

115
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,150
This place isn't some demon's lair.

116
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,550
This is Danxia Land.

117
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,550
Heavenly Lord Dacheng is in charge.

118
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,380
This is where immortals reside.

119
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,440
Only those with spiritual roots and
enlightened minds can enter here,

120
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,500
so you're not a disobedient child.

121
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,190
You're a child destined for immortality.

122
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Then are you an immortal too?

123
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,900
Can you take me to find my dad?

124
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,700
Of course I can.

125
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,800
As long as you don't cry,
I'll take you out of here.

126
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,400
Let's go.

127
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,630
Little one, what's your name?

128
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,770
Where do you live?

129
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,270
My name is Fengyou. I live in Yupei
Village on Qinggang Mountain.

130
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,390
My dad's surname is Hong.

131
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,790
He's the most famous
hunter in the village.

132

Yupei Village?

133
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,320
But I remember

134
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,030
Yupei Village had the same
name as a former emperor,

135
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,030
so it was renamed

136
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,560
Lupei Village decades ago.

137
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes, it's Lupei, you're right.

138
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,840
It's just that our village is quite poor

139
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,550
and mostly old people are left.

140
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,120
They're all used to calling
it Yupei Village.

141
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,580
They don't like to change.

142
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,840
Is that so?

143
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,130
Miss...

144
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,200
Lupei Village was a name I just made up.

145
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,630
How long are you going to
keep up this act, demon?

146
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

147
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,790
Miss, you're hurting me.

148
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,380
My cultivation is mediocre,

149
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,790
but I'm competent enough

150
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,210
to know demon from human.

151
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,770

What's your relationship with him?

Are you his servant?

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,930
Senior Meng Chu,

170
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,970
what can I do for you?

171
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,910
For me?

172
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,480
Yes.

173
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,040
You're not the type to meddle
in others' affairs.

174
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,080
What, do you need something from me?

175
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,810
I need to go to the Nine Heavens.

176
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,260
Nine Heavens?

177
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,720
The realm of immortals?

178
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,560
What are you going there for?

179
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,510
Thank you, little girl,

180
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,140
for setting things up for me.

181
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,320
Where do you think you're going?

182
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,220
Fan Jiaojiao, how dare you ruin my plans!

183
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,180
Drop the nails!

184
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,790
Set up the joy formation!

185
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,660
You Nailers

186
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,990
are so noisy!

187
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,480
Yun, it's up to you now.

188
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,970
Immortal Lord Fan, hurry!

189
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,510
Banish evil and malice; let joy
descend from the heavens.

190
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,710
Banish evil and malice; let joy
descend from the heavens.

191
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,950
Banish evil and malice; let joy
descend from the heavens.

192
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,430
Oh no! Oh no!

193
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,850
Something has happened to Her Ladyship!

194
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
What's all the panic about?

195
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,070
Her Ladyship

196
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,260
accidentally went to the Hell Ruins.

197
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,750
Go find Fan Jiaojiao.

198
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,080
The Heavenly Lord is in seclusion
and must not be disturbed.

199
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,500
Heavenly Lord.

200
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,130
What's going on?

201
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,950
I just heard a commotion
from the Hell Ruins.

202
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,230
When I inquired,

203
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,720
I found out it was Her Ladyship.

204
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,750
She accidentally entered

205
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,010
the barrier sealing the demonic beasts.

206
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,590
-It’s all Fan Ling'er’s fault.
-She really can’t stay still for a moment.

207
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,640
Fine. Since I can't leave,

208
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,250
you'll have to stay and keep me company.

209
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,930
Immortal Lord Fan, don't mind me.

210
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,000
Carry on.

211
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,300
Little girl, you've got some guts.

212
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,880
Yun, come!

213
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,450
Heavenly Lord?

214
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,050
Your spiritual energy is damaged,

215
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,010
yet you still dare to fight me?

216
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,560
To deal with you,

217
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,480
it is enough.

218
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,420
Bai Jiusi,

219
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,080
you found

220
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,740
the substitute for Siling quite quickly.

221
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,860
My eyes are like mirrors,
seeing through the dust.

222
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,520
Reveal the true evil quickly.

223
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,710
I... I killed her?

224
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,430
That was just a clone.

225
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,580
Master, shall I lead a team to pursue?

226
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,640
No need.

227
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,590
She can run,

228
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,620
but I can catch her again.

229
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,400
Li Qingyue?

230
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,480
Actually, you've seen her before.

231
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,610
All these years,

232
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,460
she has been guarding the
mountain gate with me.

233
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,720
Oh you.

234
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,190
How did you end up falling

235
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,040
for the same person
as Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

236
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,030
My parents passed away early.

237
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,950
At 11, the Sect Leader chose me
to join the sect.

238
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,640
I devoted myself to cultivation,

239
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,310
only wanting to attain immortality
as soon as possible.

240
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,310
During that time,

241
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,860
becoming an immortal was my obsession.

242
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,370
♪ Pressing to my ear, brushing slowly ♪

243
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,160
Most disciples in the sect were like me.

244
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,050
Only she was different.

245
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,100
♪ Heartbeat drowns out
the quickened breathing ♪

246

♪ Intertwined, we burn ♪

247
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,730
Her aptitude was ordinary,

248
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,710
her appearance even more so.

249
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,930
Yet she possessed a certain

250
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,480
♪ No one escapes death ♪

251
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,880
carefree and content aura.

252
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,370
She didn't hurry, act impatient,
pursue or resist.

253

♪ Fate begins and ends,
just karma at play ♪

254

Sometimes when I saw her,

255
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,750
I suddenly felt

256
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,750
calm inside too,

257
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,520
as if finding the Way
and becoming immortal

258

♪ So why care about what others say? ♪

259

wasn't that important anymore.

260
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
Then why didn't you tell her?

261
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,830
Indeed.

262
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:13,220

♪ Reaching out to me with arms so warm ♪

265
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,790
During this time,

266
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,200
I asked myself this question every day.

267
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:33,340
♪ Telling me, you're not afraid ♪

268
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,080
Perhaps I feared displeasing Master,

269
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,920
or perhaps

270
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,570
I was afraid of being rejected by her.

271
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,310
Or maybe I felt I had enough time

272
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,400
♪ Even if we part, these memories ♪

273

Later on,

276
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,570
I injured my qihai,

277
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,800
lost all my magical powers,

♪ And every breath I take ♪

279
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,750
and my cultivation was completely ruined.

280
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,870
Then I was even more afraid to tell her.

281
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,790
My magic is mediocre.

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,960
But what about her? What has she done?

335
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
She became the Heavenly Lady

336
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,660
with just her face.

337
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,850
Does she deserve it?

338
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,710
I know Ling'er's sins are grave,

339
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,450
but I beg you to consider our relationship

340
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,420
and spare Ling'er's life.

341
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,740
What do you want to do?

342
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,720
She wanted to kill me because of you.

343
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,720
Shouldn't it be up to you to decide?

344
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,650
My Lady, you were in danger twice.

345
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Naturally, it's up to you to decide.

346
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,270
So whatever I say goes?

347
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,980
I heard from Ning Yan

348
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,510
that in Danxia Land,

349
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,550
those who commit grave sins

350
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,590
are to be imprisoned in the Land of Ruins,

351
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,910
never to be released.

352
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,550
The Land of Ruins?

353
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,440
How is that any different
from killing Ling'er?

354
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,550
This absolutely cannot be allowed!

355
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,030
Immortal Lord Fan, you can't even
discipline your own daughter.

356
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,240
Stepping forward now,

357
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,850
do you want to bear the punishment

358
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,130
with your daughter?

359
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,070
Send her to the Ruins.

360
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,680
Yes.

361
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,240
You broke into the Hell Ruins at night
where the demonic beasts are kept,

362
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,170
and released the sealed Honglian.

363
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,320
Don't you think you should explain?

364
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,790
Shouldn't you give me
an explanation first?

365
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,190
What do I need to explain?

366
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
Is what Fan Ling'er said true?

367
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,340
Did you truly marry me

368
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,880
because my appearance

369
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,280
is identical to that of
Divine Lord Siling?

370
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,170
If what you plan to say
is not what I want to hear,

371
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,340
then don't say anything more.

372
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,220
Sect Leader once said

373
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,610
that there must be some
karmic fate for me,

374
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,340
a mere mortal, to be chosen
by the Heavenly Lord.

375
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,880
I initially thought

376
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,660
that I had some undiscovered talent.

377
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,400
It turns out it's just
because of this face.

378
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,750
Rest assured, Heavenly Lord.

379
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,980
I know my place.

380
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,230
From today on, I will
certainly be obedient

381
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,950
and act well as the Heavenly Lady.

382
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,910
My Lady, are you alright?

383
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,170
Are you hurt anywhere? Is it serious?

384
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,480
Should we call for
a divine healer to take a look?

385
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,270
I've prepared some
purifying spirit water for you.

386
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,310
When you enter a room,

387
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,480
sprinkle a bit on yourself.

388
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
This will remove any bad luck

389
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,040
and stay—

390
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Immortal Lord Cang Tu, please wait.

391
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,420
Immortal Lord Cang Tu,

392
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,980
may I have a few words with Ling'er?

393
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,360
Thank you.

394
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,880
The Land of Ruins is so far away.

395
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,970
You really know how to get into trouble.

396
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,410
The Land of Ruins is extremely cold,

397
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,500
while you have a fire-controlling body.

398
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,690
You must be very careful.

399
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,970
Don't let the cold
invade your vital points.

400
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,930
It's good to suffer
a bit early on.

401
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,700
It'll save you from always pursuing things
that don't belong to you

402
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,190
and wasting your time.

403
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,640
The Nine Heavens and Four Seas are vast.

404
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,030
There are all kinds of people out there.

405
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,830
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

406
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,270
My actions

407
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,340
didn't involve you at all.

408
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,380
Why bother putting up this act?

409
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,290
From childhood to now,

410
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,550
you've always cared about
yourself the most.

411
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,910
You only used cheap things to appease me.

412
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,480
Seeing your face now

413
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,960
makes me sick.

414
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,480
Are you angry at me

415
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,740
for not bearing the punishment with you?

416
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,190
Ling'er, you need to understand

417
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,910
that only by staying outside

418
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,000
do I have a chance to plead
with Master for leniency.

419
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,030
There's no need.

420
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,010
You were never there when I needed you.

421
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,550
I don't need a father anymore.

422
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,640
Let's go.

423
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,450
Ling'er...

424
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,270
The Heavenly Lord has ordered

425
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,270
to imprison you in the Land of Ruins,

426
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,830
never to leave.

427
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,430
I've forged swords for
the Heavenly Lord for years.

428
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,830
I never thought

429
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,030
he would treat me like this
for a mere mortal.

430
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,510
The Heavenly Lord spared your life

431
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,310
out of respect for your father.

432
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,520
Otherwise,

433
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,540
you would have already perished
under his sword.

434
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,430
The Land of Ruins
is the source of all cold.

435
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,820
After three to five years,

436
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,450
the cold will invade your body
and you'll lose your cultivation.

437
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,190
By then, even if you could leave,

438
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,070
you would become mortal

439
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,770
and forever suffer from the torment of
cold-related illnesses.

440
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,410
The Ruins is bitterly cold.

441
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,200
Take care, celestial attendant.

442
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,330
Get out!

443
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,690
You have no money,
yet you drink on credit every day.

444
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,850
Leave now and don't come back again.

445

Didn't she give you money?

446
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What right do you have to
stop me from drinking?

447
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,420
Your wife has been begging us

448

to not serve you any more alcohol.

449

pay back a few copper coins,

455

when I see her later,

I'll beat her to death!

459
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,070
I can drink anywhere.

460
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,360
I'll just sit outside and drink.

00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,790
So what if I am?

500
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,810
You can reminisce on your own.
I won't be joining you.

501
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,060
You won't take responsibility for
the demon you let escape?

503
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,960
Mr. Xu, why are you closing up shop too?

504
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,360
The streets aren't safe now.

505
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,890
Who dares to open for business?

506
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,420
-Stop talking. Go back.
-Safety is priority.

507
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,550
Let's not talk anymore.
We're closing up now.

508
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,550
Why are the streets so deserted?

509
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,810
Let's go back quickly.

510
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,760
It seems she has already
started causing trouble.

511
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,560
Are you talking about Honglian?

512
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,860
Go and investigate, and you'll find out.

513
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,320
Thank you.

514
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,230
Next.

515
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,820
Excuse me, sir.

516
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,000
Why are there so few people on the streets
in the middle of the day?

517
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,280
You're not a local, right?

518
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,110
That's right, my husb—

519
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,480
My husband and I just arrived.

520
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,580
I advise you to leave quickly.

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,960
A few days ago, someone outside the city
had their heart dug out by a demon.

523
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,320
Now the entire Songhe County
is in a state of panic.

524
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,070
Demon?

525
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,550
Yes, a demon that digs out
people's hearts.

526
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,590
It's terrifying just to think about it.

527
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,960
What a coincidence! We are demon hunters.

528
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,510
Where is the home

529
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,000
of the person who had his heart dug out?

530
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,670
We'll go there and see if we can help.

The last house in the east of the city.
