[Episode 27]

3
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,280
You didn't sleep again last night.

4
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,590
I'm not tired.

5
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,640
I just wrote down the questionable points

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,040
we discussed last night.

7
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,789
Were you woken up
by Prefect Zheng's snoring?

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,690
It's alright.

9
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,910
I'm not tired anyway.

10
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,390
It's time for him to head to court.

11
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,860
It's okay.

12
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,360
Who dares...

13
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,490
Your Highness.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,870
Prefect Zheng.

15
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,430
You sure slept well.

16
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,870
Your Highness, Princess Yongci,
please forgive me.

17
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,329
I have been discourteous.

18
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,700
His Highness was just
being a bit childish.

19
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,540
Do you feel unwell, Prefect Zheng?

20
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,500
No, not at all.

21
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,000
I was just feeling thirsty.

22
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,190
Your Highness, this gesture of yours

23
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,000
actually felt to me like refreshing rain

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,230
after a long drought. Very nice.

25
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,850
Prefect Zheng, you've been working
tirelessly

26
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,220
on the patrol arrangements.

27
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,020
However,

28
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,970
there's another matter that

29
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,690
I need to trouble you with, Prefect Zheng.

30
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,180
Please don't speak of trouble.

31
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,300
Whatever tasks you two have,

32
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,850
just give the order and I'll do it.

33
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,120
Please make a run to
the Ministry of Archives, Prefect Zheng,

34
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,060
to copy the records of
the three murder cases in Guanyin Town

35
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,570
and Fourth Young Master Wu's murder case,

36
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,980
including the weather conditions
and astronomical events of those days,

37
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,220
for future reference in the investigation.

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,850
Your Highness may not be aware,

39
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,250
but the monthly astronomical records
are under the Imperial Astrology Bureau,

40
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,940
and are submitted in secret
directly to His Majesty.

41
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,870
I have no authority to access them.

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,650
I've heard that you, Prefect Zheng,

43
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,060
and the current Court Diarist

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,620
are close friends
who passed the imperial exam together.

45
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,680
Surely he can do you this small favor?

46
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,850
Please rest assured, Your Highness,

47
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,650
I will not fail you.

48
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,610
Someone,

49
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,800
quick, bring me my official robe!

50
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,460
How could the Court Diary

51
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,190
contain astronomical records
for Guanyin Town?

52
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,780
I just wanted to give him something to do

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,310
so he wouldn't be in our way.

54
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,230
You still suspect Zhang Dongxuan?

55
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,900
As for the Heavenly Way Society,

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,980
apart from that old fraud's own claims,

57
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,779
no one can verify its existence.

58
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,209
Besides,

59
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,180
the first body in Guanyin Town

60
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,040
was found right outside his door.

61
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,880
And with

62
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,060
these drawings found in his house,

63
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,940
even if he wasn't physically capable of
carrying out the murders himself,

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,250
it can't prove
he had nothing to do with it.

65
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,450
But these drawings

66
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,250
might not have been drawn by him.

67
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,810
My father must have verified his story

68
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,100
in Guanyin Town

69
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,360
before believing he wasn't
the real culprit.

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,010
I know.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,330
Then why do you still suspect him?

72
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,810
Until there's concrete evidence,

73
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,060
this is merely a matter of belief
or disbelief.

74
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,620
You and Lord Shen choose to believe him,

75
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,860
so you investigate accordingly;

76
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,840
I don't trust him,

77
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,570
so I investigate differently.

78
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,540
This old fraud is skilled at

79
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,980
saying whatever suits the moment.

80
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,540
As long as I remain skeptical,

81
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,740
we won't all end up
being led about at his whim.

82
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,500
All right.

83
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,510
I do have some thoughts
about these drawings.

84
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,370
Why don't we ask him about

85
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,100
the details of the other two murder cases

86
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,980
and his investigation process?

87
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,840
We might discover something new.

88
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,790
That old fraud

89
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
is quite silver-tongued.

90
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,810
He gets all riled up like a fighting cock
whenever he sees me.

91
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,890
I won't go with you,

92
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,850
so I don't get in the way
while you question him.

93
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,470
Okay.

94
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,650
[Ministry of Justice]

95
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,270
Your Highness seems quite angry today.

96
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,770
If there's anything you want to know,

97
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,330
just ask.

98
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,330
You once gave fortune readings
to all three victims

99
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,390
from Guanyin Town.

100
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,540
For the latter two,
were their readings made

101
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,800
before or after the flaying case,

102
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,100
and how much time lay between them?

103
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,370
Of course it was before!

104
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm not stupid.

105
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,690
I clearly knew that
those from the Heavenly Way Society

106
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,810
had got their eyes on me.

107
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,540
Why would I still show up
in public to do readings?

108
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,180
If they had discovered me,

109
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,980
wouldn't my life have been over?

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,300
Bring them up.

111
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,100
These are folk legends about

112
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,240
various punishments
for evil people after death,

113
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,340
which almost exactly match
the manner of death

114
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,670
of the latter two victims in Guanyin Town.

115
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,250
The second victim

116
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,570
divorced his wife to marry another woman,

117
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,370
falsely accused his ex-wife of infidelity,

118
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,370
and was painfully killed by
having his tongue severed,

119
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,250
corresponding to
the tongue-severing punishment.

120
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,340
The third victim

121
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,180
refused to provide for his aged Father,

122
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,210
drove his Father out in the dead of winter
to freeze and starve to death,

123
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,890
and was tied naked to the frozen river
to freeze to death in the end,

124
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,020
corresponding to the ice punishment.

125
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,250
What are you doing?

126
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,100
Is that right?

127
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,180
Yes.

128
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,490
Then do you know

129
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,750
who hid these drawings in your house?

130
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,300
How do you know
I didn't draw these myself?

131
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,450
What... What are you doing?

132
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,250
You... You...

133
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,610
What is this for?

134
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,740
I still had my doubts yesterday,

135
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,740
but now,

136
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,990
I can confirm you have hemophobia.

137
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,500
If you're this afraid even of
these drawings,

138
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,830
there's no way you'd be capable of murder.

139
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,130
If those officials knew that

140
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,620
such an illness actually exists
in this world,

141
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,710
then my crimes

142
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,210
would truly be cleared.

143
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,570
Officials aren't all-knowing.

144
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,010
Even physicians

145
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,100
might have only read about this illness
in medical texts.

146
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,659
But you shouldn't feel wronged.

147
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,330
After all, you did give fortune readings

148
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,450
to all three victims.

149
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,980
If you claim
it was just a coincidence,

150
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,690
it's hard for anyone to believe.

151
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,000
I also know that wasn't a coincidence.

152
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,770
When those three murders happened
one after another,

153
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,860
I realized that

154
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,770
the Heavenly Way Society never intended
to let me go.

155
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,720
But what I don't understand is

156
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,840
why they wanted to frame me.

157
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,940
Weren't they worried

158
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,690
I might get caught by government officials

159
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,940
and spill everything?

160
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,340
You did tell everything,

161
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,620
but does anyone believe you

162
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,820
other than Lord Shen?

163
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,820
That's true.

164
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,500
They already knew that
even if I got caught,

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,700
no one would believe
what I said anyway.

166
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,090
By framing you,

167
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,940
they could not only cover their crimes,

168
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,370
but also quietly erase
the existence of the Heavenly Way Society—

169
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,230
killing two birds with one stone.

170
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,690
Such calculation is really terrifying.

171
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,140
Do you know

172
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,220
who the leader of
the Heavenly Way Society is?

173
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,559
No idea.

174
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,659
The Society Leader rarely showed up.

175
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,490
All I know is that

176
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,090
he always wears a white mask.

177
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,380
He's a tall, slim man with good posture.

178
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,380
Can't tell his age,

179
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,300
but his voice sounds very steady.

180
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,160
Then what is this
Black Unrighteous Flower you mentioned?

181
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,890
Your Highness has cleared me of suspicion.

182
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,570
I'll never forget your great kindness,

183
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,810
so I'll tell you everything I know.

184
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,070
According to that old man,

185
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,850
the Heavenly Way Society specially
looks for

186
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,420
people like me near government offices,

187
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,610
the miserable ones with grievances
but nowhere to appeal.

188
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,730
He himself suffered great injustice too.

189
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,060
That black-petaled, red-stamened
unrighteous flower pattern

190
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,940
was created by the Society Leader.

191
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,780
I heard

192
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,660
this kind of flower

193
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,090
can only be found at execution sites.

194
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,540
It requires

195
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,260
human blood to bloom—a flower from hell.

196
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,100
Drawing this flower at execution sites

197
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,970
is meant to warn people that

198
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,970
the heavenly way no longer exists,

199
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,120
and evil has spread everywhere.

200
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,930
Everywhere?

201
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,900
Doesn't that mean

202
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,010
as long as
the Heavenly Way Society exists,

203
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,990
there will

204
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,270
continue to be murders in this world?

205
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,640
Wan.

206
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,260
Master Wan.

207
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,230
A tongue-severing case has taken place
in the capital too.

208
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,240
So it really is the Heavenly Way Society.

209
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,330
Take him back to the prefect's office.

210
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,950
Yes.

211
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,940
Be careful, all of you.

212
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,600
Don't contaminate the scene.

213
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,130
Did you see it clearly?

214
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,460
Was his tongue really severed?

215
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,060
I saw it clearly.

216
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,950
There was blood all over his face.

217
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,910
The other day over there,

218
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,730
wasn't there someone who got flayed?

219
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,290
-So brutal.
-Flaying?

220
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,240
Flaying

221
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,380
and tongue-severing...

222
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,940
That's some serious grudge!

223
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,900
I've heard

224
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,180
they were both evildoers,

225
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,980
and that's why

226
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,800
they were punished by heaven.

227
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,420
That's still terrifying.

228
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,090
It seems even the capital area
isn't safe anymore.

229
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,330
Exactly.

230
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,020
If the capital prefecture

231
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,350
doesn't give us all a proper explanation,

232
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,300
who among us common folks

233
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,730
would dare go out at night again, right?

234
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,060
Yes! Right!

235
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,780
They must give us an explanation today.

236
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,850
We demand answers!

237
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,060
Everyone step back!

238
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,810
Move back!

239
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,980
Step back! This is a crime scene!

240
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,020
Don't come any closer!

241
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,330
I am Princess Yongci,

242
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,090
here by imperial order to investigate
the capital's murder scene

243
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,090
and examine the body.

244
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,320
Everyone, please step back

245
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,920
to preserve the crime scene.

246
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,060
So they sent a princess.

247
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,450
A woman showing her face in public
to examine corpses?

248
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,090
Is she capable of that?

249
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,730
Exactly.

250
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,380
Quick, bring in
a brave male coroner instead.

251
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,610
We just want to know who the victim is,

252
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,180
when the murderer will be caught,

253
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,330
and whether we can still go out
at night in the future.

254
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,260
Right! We need answers!

255
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,810
Please stop crowding.

256
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,810
If you contaminate the scene

257
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,900
and damage evidence,

258
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,330
the real culprit will escape justice

259
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,690
and hide among us.

260
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,750
Perhaps

261
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,090
the next victim

262
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,690
could be someone dear to you.

263
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,730
Surely none of you want

264
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,730
to cause such consequences, right?

265
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,160
I am Yan Chi, Deputy Minister of Justice.

266
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,540
The prefect's office will increase
night patrols

267
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,380
to ensure the safety of the people.

268
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,330
As for the victim's identity,

269
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,940
once Princess Yongci
completes the autopsy,

270
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,970
I'll provide you all with an answer.

271
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,440
I think he has a point.

272
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,490
That makes sense.

273
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,660
Come on.

274
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,020
Everyone step back.

275
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,930
Move along.

276
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,440
This is a critical period
for the case investigation.

277
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,690
The more time is wasted,

278
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,090
the harder it will be to solve the case.

279
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,660
As citizens of the capital,

280
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,140
you not only enjoy the prosperity
of living under imperial rules,

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,200
but also share the responsibility
to safeguard it.

282
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,540
Therefore, you should neither
believe rumors

283
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,000
nor act on your own accord.

284
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,850
Everyone, please step back
and return home

285
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,210
to assist the capital prefecture
with our investigation,

286
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,410
so as to bring peace back to the capital.

287
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,840
Come on, everyone. Step back.

288
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,180
Thank you for your cooperation.

289
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,420
I promise you all that

290
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,020
we'll solve this case as soon as possible.

291
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,260
I'll make the sketches,

292
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,660
and you examine the body.

293
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,020
Can Her Highness solve this alone?

294
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,540
Based on the traces here,

295
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,400
it appears someone once hid here,

296
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,940
but it's unclear
whether it was the killer.

297
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,010
Note down where the tongue was severed.

298
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,530
Note this.

299
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,420
There're calluses
on the victim's right ring finger,

300
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,210
likely from years of writing.

301
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,620
The victim was likely a scholar.

302
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,250
The fingers are twisted.

303
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,610
There's a large amount of blood
in his mouth,

304
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,940
indicating the tongue was severed
while he was still alive.

305
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,180
Black petals and red stamens...

306
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,330
Could it be the unrighteous flower?

307
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,590
This appears to be drawn with lead chalk.

308
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,610
This ink also carries a scent of agarwood.

309
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,960
And it's top-quality, submerged agarwood
at that.

310
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,140
Greetings, Your Highness, Princess Yongci.

311
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,850
I've come on order of Prefect Zheng

312
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,180
to sketch the deceased.

313
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,420
Mr. Ning, your painting skills
are exceptional.

314
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,180
Thank you for your efforts.

315
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,330
You flatter me, Princess Yongci.

316
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,610
I didn't get the chance
to thank you earlier, Mr. Ning.

317
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,730
I appreciate your hard work, Mr. Ning,

318
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,210
in sketching Fourth Young Master Wu.

319
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,450
Your Highness is too kind.

320
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,050
I'm merely a humble painter.

321
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,660
Being able to do some small things
within my ability for the government

322
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,490
is my humble contribution to

323
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,690
safeguarding the peace of the capital.

324
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,140
Please.

325
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,460
Constable Zhan.

326
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,300
Once Mr. Ning completes the portrait,

327
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,310
post it up

328
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,060
and have the neighborhood chiefs

329
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,810
go to the morgue to identify the body.

330
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,450
Yes.

331
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,420
Oh my!

332
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,230
Honey, what a tragic death you suffered!

333
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,540
How am I supposed to live without you!

334
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,220
Mrs. Zhao, are you sure
you know the victim?

335
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,560
He's my husband,

336
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,120
Zhao Jiaxu.

337
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,780
You worked so hard to support our family,

338
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,260
leaving home early and returning late

339
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,730
to teach the children of the Wei family.

340
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,450
Honey...

341
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,890
Mrs. Zhao.

342
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,270
Are you saying Mr. Zhao was out
working as a tutor?

343
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,430
It was the Wei family

344
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,270
who insisted that
he teach evening lessons.

345
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,210
Princess Yongci.

346
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,810
Mrs. Zhao, please go home now.

347
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,860
We'll catch the murderer
as soon as possible.

348
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,790
I'll escort her.

349
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,400
This way, Mrs. Zhao.

350
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,730
This way.

351
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,460
Did you discover something?

352
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,620
Why didn't you tell Mrs. Zhao about it?

353
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,850
Check out the stains on these pants.

354
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,900
This is...

355
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,330
Male essence?

356
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,090
There're also older stains
on these clothes,

357
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,140
which indicates he wasn't out teaching,

358
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,420
but having an affair.

359
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,210
The flaying

360
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,670
and tongue-severing,

361
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,099
such rare coincidental crimes

362
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,540
actually occurred twice.

363
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,300
If it wasn't done by
the culprit of the Guanyin Town cases,

364
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,430
who else could it be?

365
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,760
So you don't suspect him anymore?

366
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,510
The pattern at the scene
is already blurred.

367
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,900
Sir, can you tell

368
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,780
if this matches the Heavenly Way Society's
unrighteous flower?

369
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,530
Although it's blurry,

370
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,580
the color and general shape are the same.

371
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,900
Is there any particular significance
to the colors?

372
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,380
My family has a secret formula
for making colored chalk sticks.

373
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,450
The lead chalk sticks of these two colors

374
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,290
were specifically prepared by me

375
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,690
at the Society Leader's request.

376
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,450
Did you add submerged agarwood
when making the ink?

377
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,030
Yes.

378
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,670
All the materials were provided
by the Society.

379
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,730
Have you given this secret formula
to anyone else?

380
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,940
To leave the Heavenly Way Society sooner,

381
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,400
I offered the formula
to the Society Leader.

382
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,530
So this time,

383
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,830
could it be the Society Leader himself
who did it?

384
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,350
This murder case

385
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,340
is far more brutal than the previous ones.

386
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,150
If they stopped

387
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,970
after three executions back then

388
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,010
to avoid drawing attention
from the government,

389
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,050
why would they dare
to commit such brazen crimes

390
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,250
under the emperor's nose
after lying low for five years?

391
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,070
Perhaps they never truly lay low.

392
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,380
They simply moved their actions
to the capital.

393
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,340
The capital?

394
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,250
Why the capital?

395
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,340
Acting on Heaven's behalf...

396
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,290
Heavenly Way...

397
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,470
Could it be His Majesty?

398
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,420
That I truly don't know.

399
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,000
These are all just speculations.

400
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,530
Whatever the Heavenly Way Society
is plotting,

401
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,010
we cannot allow them to continue
their brutal killings.

402
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,540
But now, there are too few
clues and evidence.

403
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,970
What else do you know about
that Society Leader?

404
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,490
The Society Leader values rituals
and propriety greatly,

405
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,690
and believes in following
the way of heaven.

406
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,860
Everything must be done according to

407
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,660
the calendar and proper timing.

408
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,550
According to the Society Leader,

409
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,660
disrupting the order is equivalent to
disrupting heaven's timing.

410
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,050
In that case,

411
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,680
that Society Leader must be someone with

412
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,450
a high opinion of himself
and extremely strict self-discipline.

413
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,250
His rules won't change on a whim,

414
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,940
and his order of executions

415
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,420
won't be easily altered either.

416
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,180
The Heavenly Way Society's
execution methods

417
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,420
are derived from the folk legends of hell,

418
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,210
and they select victims
according to a specific order.

419
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,100
The first cases in both Guanyin Town
and the capital

420
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,560
were skin-flaying cases,

421
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,830
followed by tongue-severing cases.

422
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,810
The next one

423
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,750
will be the ice case.

424
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,730
Since you're skilled at fortune-telling,

425
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,730
shouldn't you also be able to

426
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,070
predict the time and location
of the murders?

427
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,870
Your Highness flatters me.

428
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,660
I just read some books

429
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,250
when I was young and learned a bit.

430
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,620
All I did was
read people's expressions

431
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,750
and tell them what they wanted to hear
to make some money.

432
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,640
No one else can know about
tonight's matter.

433
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,010
If you can figure out

434
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,010
the connection between the solar terms,

435
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,580
time, and location of
the three murder cases in Guanyin Town,

436
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,980
I'll release you from prison immediately.

437
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,660
Are you trying to use this method

438
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,460
to predict the time and location
of the next crime?

439
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,490
You old fraud.

440
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,450
I mean, Mr. Zhang, according to you,

441
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,910
since that Society Leader

442
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,940
values celestial timing and calendar
so much,

443
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,380
he should adhere even more to
the right time and location.

444
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,100
As long as we figure out

445
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,210
the pattern behind these vigilante cases
in Guanyin Town,

446
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,050
we can take precautions in advance.

447
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,580
Exactly.

448
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,860
Your Highness, Princess Yongci.

449
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,100
When do you plan to release me
from this prison?

450
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,970
I've been in this dungeon for five years

451
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,180
without even touching a single book.

452
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,530
I need to go back and prepare properly,

453
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,860
so as not to mess up
this important matter.

454
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,570
Tonight,

455
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,340
I'll document your illness and hemophobia

456
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,710
and submit it to His Highness, Mr. Zhang.

457
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,330
Tomorrow,

458
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,320
I'll release you from prison.

459
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,560
[Map of Guanyin Town]

460
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,840
How did you think of using Zhang Dongxuan

461
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,900
to deduce the time and location
of the crime?

462
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,360
It was truly a genius move.

463
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,340
I only know
how to utilize people's talents.

464
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,490
You cleared his name
with just a drop of blood.

465
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,820
That's some real skill.

466
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,730
I genuinely admire you.

467
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,060
Spare me your flattery.

468
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,860
These are the divination records
of Guanyin Town.

469
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,820
Tomorrow, I'll give them to Mr. Zhang,

470
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,580
so he can examine
whether the Guanyin Town cases

471
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,690
had any special

472
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,210
celestial characteristics back then.

473
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,340
You really found it?

474
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,580
I thought you were just trying

475
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,110
to get rid of Prefect Zheng.

476
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,250
I was truly looking for it,

477
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,940
but also truly wanted to get rid of him.

478
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,270
There's one more thing.

479
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,140
The prefect of Luozhou, which
Guanyin Town belonged to at that time,

480
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,970
was Li Muyun.

481
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,420
Then why isn't Li Muyun's signature

482
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,180
on the Ministry of Justice's case files?

483
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,420
Because he never
got involved in this case.

484
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,530
Three murder cases in a row

485
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,050
directly alarmed the Ministry of Justice,

486
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,770
so they took over the cases immediately.

487
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,860
Then could it be that
the transcripts and annotations from

488
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,450
when my father re-investigated the case
were all destroyed by Li Muyun?

489
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,910
He joined the Supreme Court
after this case.

490
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,210
Logically speaking,

491
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,210
he wouldn't have had the opportunity.

492
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,010
What if he destroyed them
after that incident happened to my father?

493
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,290
But this case has no connection
to Prince Jin's case.

494
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,090
Li Muyun would have no reason
to go to such trouble.

495
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,100
This major case in Guanyin Town
happened under his jurisdiction,

496
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,900
so he couldn't possibly be unaware of it.

497
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,820
There must be some connection here.

498
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,010
But what could it be?

499
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,080
Don't overthink it for now.

500
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,350
You need to have some good rest.

501
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,900
But there are still
so many unresolved matters.

502
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,100
No matter how many problems there are,

503
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,160
I'll be with you every step of the way.

504
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,620
Let's take it step by step.

505
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,050
There'll always be light
at the end of the tunnel,

506
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,650
so no need to rush things now.

507
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,430
[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

508
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,940
Lord Yan always sends you out
to do all sorts of tasks.

509
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,250
Let's go, hurry.

510
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,230
Hurry up.

511
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,940
It seems

512
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,490
that my autopsy work

513
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,340
is known to everyone
in this household now.

514
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,350
They're all just ignorant people.

515
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,180
My Lady, you're performing autopsies
by imperial order,

516
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,040
yet they actually look down on us.

517
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,490
My Lady, please don't take it to heart.

518
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,860
Just go back and have a good rest.

519
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,140
I'll go buy you something delicious,

520
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,660
so you'll have something warm to eat
as soon as you wake up.

521
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,340
It seems

522
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,470
Bai Feng has taken you out quite often.

523
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,840
I only hung out with him
to find nice things for you, My Lady.

524
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,940
Is that Mo Yu from Aunt's household?

525
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,470
Who else could it be but her?

526
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,050
When you weren't home, My Lady,

527
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,530
she came every day to snoop around,

528
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,580
and I never said a single kind word
to her.

529
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,210
In the next few days,

530
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,260
pack up my things.

531
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,690
We'll be moving out.

532
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,030
My Lady, are you marrying Lord Yan?

533
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,210
Don't talk nonsense.

534
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,830
Who said I'm marrying him?

535
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,770
You're not?

536
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,860
But if you're not getting married,

537
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,080
how can we move out?

538
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,530
If a woman's capable,

539
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,940
she can go anywhere she wants

540
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,140
and live well without needing to marry.

541
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,660
I should be asking you.

542
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,320
Have you decided to marry him?

543
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,010
Of course not!

544
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,450
My Lady, you once said

545
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,250
a woman should see herself as precious

546
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,110
and not beg for a man's affection.

547
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,430
I won't be a concubine.

548
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,470
No matter how well you
and His Highness treat me,

549
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,620
My Lady, it's still not acceptable.

550
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,880
What are you thinking?

551
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,250
The "him" I was referring to

552
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,220
is General Bai.

553
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
My Lady,

554
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,620
we should go.

555
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,290
Why are you being shy?

556
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,140
I'm not. Stop it.

557
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,550
Madam.

558
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,310
Lady Wan has returned.

559
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,660
I've been out gathering information.

560
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,010
She's been conducting autopsy
by imperial order these days,

561
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,100
either at the capital prefecture
or at the morgue.

562
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,690
Everyone knows about it now.

563
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,050
Even with an imperial order
to conduct autopsy,

564
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,660
she's still practicing
a despicable profession.

565
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,590
She can forget about
ever being compared to Yu again.

566
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,250
Please rest assured, Madam.

567
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,010
I've had someone

568
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,210
make note of everything she's touched.

569
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,770
As soon as she's married off,
we'll burn them all

570
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,010
to avoid bad luck.

571
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,950
All right. Let's do it.

572
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,760
This way.

573
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,620
Careful!

574
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,420
What are you two doing,
lurking outside someone's door?

575
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,250
What?

576
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,440
What are you doing?

577
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,150
What do you think I'm doing?

578
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:13,900
I...

579
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,750
That lady's silhouette looked familiar
to me.

580
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,410
I think she might be
one of my former lovers.

581
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,000
May I ask which house she works at?

582
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,010
The Fengqi House.

583
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,820
She was redeemed by a man surnamed Zhao
over a year ago,

584
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,340
kept here as his mistress.

585
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,420
Disgusting.

586
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,820
You men

587
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,140
are all no good!

588
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,250
Zhao Jiaxu's wife trusted him so much,

589
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,510
yet he kept a mistress!

590
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,250
He deserved having his tongue severed!

591
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,590
That's why I'll either stay single

592
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,750
or never keep a mistress if I marry.

593
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,940
I absolutely cannot let outsiders

594
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,880
take advantage of us.

595
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,340
You make it sound nice,

596
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,260
but who knows
who'll be taking advantage of whom?

597
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,810
Let's go.

598
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,530
Why are you flirting with me in public?

599
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,660
Let's quickly inform Constable Zhan.

600
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,820
Princess Yongci and I have confirmed

601
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,290
that the two murder cases in the capital

602
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,620
are connected to the Guanyin Town murders.

603
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,820
If we don't report to His Majesty now

604
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,970
to deploy more guards and impose a curfew,

605
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,830
I fear there will be more victims.

606
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,380
But His Majesty never intended

607
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,040
to cause panic in the capital.

608
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,200
What if he blames us for spreading fear?

609
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,330
We have too few leads at hand right now.

610
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,820
If we don't create some obstacles

611
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,680
for the killer,

612
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,620
we might not even get close
to catching them

613
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,690
before His Majesty has your head.

614
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,380
Perhaps we should consult with
Minister Li about this.

615
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,890
His Majesty trusts him greatly,

616
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,290
and he was ordered to oversee this case.

617
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,770
If he's the one to propose the curfew,
it would be...

618
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,230
Draft the memorial first,

619
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,210
and I'll accompany you and Li Muyun
to present it to His Majesty.

620
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,690
As you command, Your Highness.

621
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,490
Master!

622
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,690
Master, something terrible has happened.

623
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,380
What is it?

624
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,690
Prince Rui has reported

625
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,420
that there're discrepancies
in the Shuoxi Army's provisions.

626
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,530
He says the grain sent

627
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,130
contained moldy old millet,

628
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,010
and the Shuoxi Army is now
nearly out of provisions.

629
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,450
His Majesty has urgently summoned you
back to the palace

630
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,580
to discuss countermeasures, Master.

631
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,490
Chi.

632
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,940
You've come at the right time.

633
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,180
His Majesty has summoned me to the palace,

634
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,290
so I'm entrusting Wan's safety
to you and Yue Ning.

635
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,290
Don't you let her face danger alone.

636
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,590
Don't worry.

637
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,170
Ning and I won't leave her side
for a moment.

638
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,000
Now is not the time to assign blame

639
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,260
for corruption in military provisions.

640
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,420
Resolving the provision supply
is our top priority now.

641
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,250
But this year's taxes
haven't been collected yet,

642
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,110
and the Ministry of Revenue cannot spare
any resources at the moment.

643
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,140
Then we shall borrow.

644
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,180
From where can we transport provisions

645
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,940
the fastest?

646
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,860
Your Majesty.

647
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,860
Liangzhou is closest to
the Shuoxi garrison,

648
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,770
and with favorable weather
these past two years,

649
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,180
they should have grain reserves.

650
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,210
After covering the city residents' needs,

651
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,180
there should be over a month's supply
left for the army.

652
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
I concur, Father.

653
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,860
If we can have a month's buffer,

654
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,780
the Ministry of Revenue can arrange for
new provisions.

655
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,820
In that case,

656
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,860
Crown Prince, you shall personally
make a run to Liangzhou.

657
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,530
Such an important matter
cannot be entrusted to others.

658
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,900
You should depart immediately,

659
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,050
ride swiftly,

660
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,050
and personally deliver
the provisions to Shuoxi.

661
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,900
Even if it's just surplus grain,

662
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,100
you must personally oversee its allocation

663
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,210
to ensure the army's winter provisions.

664
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,570
As you command, Father.

665
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,290
To think someone would dare
tamper with military provisions.

666
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,820
It shows that

667
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,420
I've been too lenient in issuing orders.

668
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,850
Chi.

669
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,300
I appoint you as Investigating Censor.

670
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,280
You must root out this corrupt worm,

671
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,290
and even if it involves
members of the imperial family,

672
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,620
no mercy shall be shown.

673
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,180
Better to imprison and behead more

674
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,340
than to let a single one escape.

675
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,800
As you command, Your Majesty.

676
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,340
That Zheng fellow knows nothing

677
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,540
but asking for money.

678
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,050
He's been loitering in the Shuoxi Army
for a year,

679
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,510
yet he still hasn't accomplished anything.

680
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,340
Useless.

681
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,630
The army's not like the court.

682
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,210
You can't just pass exams

683
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,660
and find a mentor to rise step by step.

684
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,620
Those soldiers are bound
by life-and-death loyalty,

685
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,590
so for a newcomer like him,

686
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,690
standing out is far from easy.

687
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,380
This Shuoxi Army provisions case
is a perfect opportunity

688
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,100
for him to climb a few steps up,

689
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,700
and our long-term plan in the army
won't be in vain.

690
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,010
But His Majesty has appointed Yan Chi
as Investigating Censor.

691
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,790
I fear that after all his investigating,

692
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,690
they might end up wiping out

693
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,770
our own people.

694
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,820
Then all the money we've spent

695
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,420
and the manpower we've gathered
over the years

696
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,210
would be for nothing, wouldn't it?

697
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,740
Mother, you worry too much.

698
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,010
Prince Rui and his son, Yan Chi,
have never gotten along.

699
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,140
Yan Chi has no control over Prince Rui.

700
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,710
When the time is right,

701
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,050
I'll find some scapegoats

702
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,450
to present to Prince Rui.

703
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,910
As long as Prince Rui is convinced,

704
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,530
there's nothing Yan Chi can do.

705
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,970
The Crown Prince is weak and incompetent.

706
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,070
As for such an important task
as delivering provisions,

707
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,190
why would your father send him?

708
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,580
Why else?

709
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,310
Obviously to build up

710
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,150
his reputation as the heir.

711
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,900
No matter how much you resent
that Zhao Shuhua, Mother,

712
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,690
the Crown Prince

713
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,940
was born from the Empress's womb.

714
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,270
Whether by legitimacy

715
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,360
or seniority,

716
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,400
his status is unshakable.

717
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,660
There's no arguing about legitimacy,

718
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,290
but when it comes to seniority and merit,

719
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,490
how could Zhao Shuhua's son deserve it?

720
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,470
If Prince Jin hadn't died,

721
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,120
her son wouldn't even
be considered senior!

722
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,560
Mother, just listen to me.

723
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,450
As long as Father doesn't mention
deposing the Crown Prince,

724
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,500
we shouldn't make unnecessary trouble.

725
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,630
The Marquis of Zhongyong is an old fox.

726
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,180
Even if the Crown Prince takes the throne,

727
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,640
he won't have an easy time.

728
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,510
If we can help depose the Crown Prince,

729
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,250
we'll go with the flow.

730
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,490
If Yan Che really takes that throne,

731
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,450
I,

732
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,180
being a prince with real power,

733
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,820
would surely live a better life
than that pathetic emperor.

734
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
That won't do.

735
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,940
I definitely cannot allow Zhao Shuhua

736
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,600
to flaunt her power before me.

737
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,180
The two of us entered the palace

738
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,730
and married His Majesty on the same day.

739
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,250
Just because
she's two years older than me,

740
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,640
she was made Empress.

741
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,700
On what grounds?

742
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,530
Until the very end,

743
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,580
no one can make me admit defeat!

744
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,900
Mother.

745
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,420
I too

746
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,520
wish to fulfill your desires.

747
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,020
However,

748
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,940
planning this
requires careful arrangements

749
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,540
to secure people's loyalty.

750
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,140
You

751
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,530
should be more frugal.

752
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,940
To accomplish great things,

753
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,220
who knows how much longer
we'll have to scheme?

754
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,720
Thank you, Mother.

755
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,040
Please rest assured, Mother.

756
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,070
Once I

757
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,480
have control over

758
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,540
the Shuoxi Army's command,

759
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,060
I'll make sure that Zhao Shuhua

760
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,170
can't hold her head up in your presence.

761
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,050
You've gone another night without sleep.

762
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,250
Ning told me about
the military provision case.

763
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,710
Is there anything I can do?

764
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,910
No need.

765
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,530
These are just petty tricks,

766
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,900
no need for your involvement.

767
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,210
However, I won't be able

768
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,970
to be with you all the time
for the time being.

769
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,100
If you need anything, just tell Yan Li.

770
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,730
Greetings, Princess Yongci.

771
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,290
W-What's going on here?

772
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,380
It wasn't in vain for a charming prince
like me to play coachman

773
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,110
after all.

774
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,340
Ever since Chi learned that
I gave my fine horse

775
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,610
to Ning,

776
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,870
he's been planning to give you
something even better.

777
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,159
That's why I...

778
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,570
I had planned
to gift you a carriage long ago.

779
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,690
It's just I only got it today.

780
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,969
I often see you coming and going
from the Marquis Mansion.

781
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,780
Borrowing a carriage isn't convenient,

782
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,050
and riding a horse yourself

783
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,380
exposes you to wind and sun,

784
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,090
so...

785
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,010
Though this carriage is small,

786
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,449
it's made entirely of ironwood,

787
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:49,489
resistant to fire

788
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,650
and impenetrable by ordinary swords.

789
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,270
This carriage has far more features
than just those.

790
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,220
Little Wan'er, let me show you something.

791
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:02,880
Look.

792
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,450
All these panels contain
separate medicine compartments.

793
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,820
And your precious coroner's kit

794
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,650
can be stored in this hidden compartment.

795
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,240
There's also this portable table,

796
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,350
fully equipped with

797
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,560
tea sets, snacks, and rain gear.

798
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,190
Beneath it is a complete set of bedding,

799
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,190
specially for your rest on the road.

800
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,290
No need to thank me.

801
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,140
If you really feel the need to repay me,

802
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,170
just

803
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,570
embroider a small pouch for me.
That'll do.

804
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,400
But

805
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,640
I don't know how to do needlework.

806
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,700
You don't even know
how to embroider a pouch?

807
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,340
So what? I don't know either.

808
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,900
That's actually better.

809
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,010
Only those sheltered women
from the inner chambers

810
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,210
would do such things.

811
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,860
A true heroine

812
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,190
would never bother with

813
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,880
such mundane matters, right?

814
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,090
Right. I agree with him.

815
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,020
Anyway,

816
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,970
I'll just give you something
I made myself.

817
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,740
Yes, that was my plan from the beginning.

818
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,500
Those two are truly
a match made in heaven.

819
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,610
Chi's finally getting it.

820
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,570
Just go ahead with your business.

821
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,450
I'll

822
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,700
go to the Supreme Court later to review
the files of the Guanyin Town cases,

823
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,530
and also check

824
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,340
Lord Shen's previous records
while I'm at it.

825
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,140
Li Muyun isn't easy to deal with.

826
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,130
Why not wait a few days
so we can go together?

827
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,790
Prefect Zheng will go with me.

828
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,500
Don't worry.

829
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,210
I'll be careful

830
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,420
and play it by ear.

831
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,860
As long as you know what you're doing.

832
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,420
The house is all set.

833
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,130
I'll come see you
once I'm done with my work.

834
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,050
Ning.

835
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,620
Seeing how lovey-dovey Chi
and Little Wan'er are,

836
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,420
it seems getting married
isn't such a bad idea.

837
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,820
If you want to get married, then do it.

838
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,950
Why tell me about it?

839
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,780
I never said I wanted to marry you.

840
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,580
Why are you getting so worked up?

841
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,610
[Supreme Court]

842
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,970
Your Highness.

843
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,780
All files of unsolved and pending cases

844
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,130
are kept in this archive.

845
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,380
I wonder when Minister Li's
approval documents will arrive?

846
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,050
Once I receive them,

847
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,530
I can properly account for everything.

848
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,780
Prefect Zheng will have them delivered.

849
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,450
Your Highnesses.

850
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,910
-Your Highness!
-Please.

851
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,900
Princess Yongci is here by imperial decree
to investigate the case.

852
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,450
Why are you being so obstructive?

853
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,130
Are you deliberately stalling?

854
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,420
No, no, I wouldn't dare.

855
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,080
I'll open the door for Your Highness
right away.

856
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,240
Your Highness.

857
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,220
Are these the files?

858
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,950
Yes.

859
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,010
Your Highness, just locate the cabinet

860
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,210
following the corresponding numbers.

861
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,540
Father.

862
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,780
I'm finally here.

863
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,900
Lower left side.

864
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,720
Stay calm.

865
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,090
Stay calm.

866
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,940
I must find the files of
Father's and Prince Jin's cases

867
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,260
before Li Muyun arrives.

868
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,400
Prince Jin's case.

869
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,920
Why aren't Father's case files here?

870
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,700
Where could they possibly be?

871
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,200
Father...

872
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,480
Thank you, Mr. Li, for making an exception
for Her Highness.

873
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,110
You flatter me, Mr. Zheng.

874
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,190
This case is also my responsibility.

875
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,530
The flaying case remains unclear,

876
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,530
and now we have this tongue-severing case.

877
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,090
I truly fear I can't escape

878
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,290
a flogging this time.

879
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,380
Li Muyun is here.

880
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,310
Go ask Little Wan'er
how much longer she needs.

881
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,000
Even if we just find a few suspects,

882
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,940
things would be easier for both of us.

883
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,140
Little Wan'er, would you like some tea?

884
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Half a cup will do.

885
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,540
Just hold on for half a cup of tea.

886
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,330
Where are you two headed?

887
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,920
I didn't know Your Highness was here.

888
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,570
Please pardon me

889
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,430
for any rudeness, Your Highness.

890
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,860
It's fine.

891
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,510
Sorry to keep you waiting, Your Highness.

892
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,300
The waiting isn't a problem,

893
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,380
but this place is so dreary,

894
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,820
without even a spot to have tea or rest.

895
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,820
I had to just sit here and do nothing.

896
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,530
The Supreme Court is a place
of law enforcement,

897
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,130
not meant for idle visitors.

898
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,090
If Your Highness is displeased,

899
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,900
you're welcome
to report it to His Majesty.

900
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,530
You...

901
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,700
Oh no.

902
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,280
I've lost count of
how many finger snaps it's been.

903
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,010
Has it been half a cup of tea yet?

904
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,660
Little Wan'er, hurry up!

905
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,660
I can't hold on much longer!

906
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,530
I still have official duties to attend to.

907
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,020
If Your Highness
has no further instructions,

908
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,220
please allow me to proceed with my work.

909
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,720
I haven't finished speaking yet!

910
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,630
You...

911
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,900
Minister Li, what happened?

912
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,170
I don't know what happened,

913
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,300
but he pushed me.

914
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,400
Minister Li.

915
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,190
Why have you upset
Princess Yongning like this?

916
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,940
I was worried Princess Yongci
would be criticized

917
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,010
for entering the storeroom
without permission,

918
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,340
so I specially came with Prefect Zheng
to deliver the approval documents.

919
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,130
However,

920
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,010
I don't understand why Princess Yongning
was blocking me?

921
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,700
It was because
I didn't want to be disturbed

922
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,560
that I asked Princess Yongning
to keep watch outside.

923
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,610
I see.

924
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,450
Then I was being presumptuous.

925
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,940
I'll go deliver the approval documents
to the treasury office right away.

926
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,400
Minister Li, please wait.

927
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,170
I have one more matter to inquire about.

928
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,340
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

929
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,050
In the murder cases of Guanyin Town,

930
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,220
the witness testimonies
against Zhang Dongxuan

931
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,080
can only prove that
he had contact with the victims,

932
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,050
but no one witnessed him
committing the crime,

933
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,310
nor is there any concrete evidence
placing him at the scene.

934
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,970
Yesterday, I also confirmed that

935
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,740
Zhang Dongxuan indeed
suffers from hemophobia.

936
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,050
He can't possibly be the culprit
behind the Guanyin Town cases.

937
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,820
Minister Li, Prefect Zheng.

938
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,950
Would you agree to declare him innocent
and release him?

939
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,900
Princess Yongci, your medical skills
are unmatched.

940
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,700
With Your Highness as guarantor,

941
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,650
I will immediately

942
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,940
arrange for his release.

943
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,710
Besides,

944
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,570
since Shen Yi classified this case
as a suspicious case,

945
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,860
why are there no notes from him

946
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,720
marking the questionable points
in the case files?

947
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,070
It was my oversight.

948
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,370
I will immediately have someone

949
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,110
investigate this matter.

950
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,130
I'll trouble you with this matter then,
Minister Li.

951
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,220
With the help of Shen Yi's clues,

952
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,170
perhaps we could

953
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,940
prevent another Guanyin Town tragedy
from happening in the capital.

954
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,340
Your Highness speaks wisely.

955
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,820
I will definitely spare no effort.

956
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,940
Princess Yongci. Prefect Zheng.

957
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,220
There's been a murder in the ice cellar
of Zuixian Restaurant, west of the city.

958
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,280
Good heavens.

959
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,580
Can't they let us have a moment of peace?

960
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:47,740
Your Highness...

961
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,420
We'll head to the scene right away.

962
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,280
I'm coming too.

963
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,220
She didn't come here for Shen Yi.

964
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,190
Could it be she's not Shen Wan?

965
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,780
[Imperial Files]

966
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,350
So she came for Prince Jin.
