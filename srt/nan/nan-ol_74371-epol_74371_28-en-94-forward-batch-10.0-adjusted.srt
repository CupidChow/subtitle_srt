00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,920
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,229
Little Wan'er,

4
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,009
that was a close one.

5
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,039
Yan Li told me
Minister Li is very high-maintenance.

6
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,580
If he files a complaint against you
to the Emperor,

7
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,950
you'll lose access to
the Ministry of Justice.

8
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,030
We'd better stay away from him.

9
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,560
I should've been more cautious.

10
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,650
I must not drag you and Yan Li
into danger again.

11
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,870
I

12
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,950
used to be a loner.

13
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,730
I wasn't considerate enough.

14
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,950
From now on,

15
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,670
I can't put you guys at risk again.

16
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,620
It's not as serious as you imagine.

17
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,449
Besides,

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,550
I'm glad to go through trouble with you.

19
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,950
But it upsets me.

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,420
Little Wan'er,

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,410
ever since the day I met you,

22
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,910
I've always known
you're no ordinary woman.

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,490
I only hope

24
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,440
that you won't be held back by anything

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,920
and that you'll always stride forward.

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,660
If you're constrained
by the fear of implicating me,

27
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,660
that will truly break my heart.

28
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,360
I can't believe I just said those words.

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
What a rare and precious friend I am.

30
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,410
Ning,

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,760
in fact...

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,810
I'm not Qin Wan.

33
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,579
I am Shen Yi's daughter,

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,690
Shen Wan.

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,650
You...

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,790
Does Chi...

37
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,370
He knew it long ago.

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,960
You...

39
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,690
I'm concealing my real identity

40
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,220
for the purpose of
clearing my father's name.

41
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,270
Are you crazy?

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,210
How could you just blurt it out?

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
You treat me with sincerity,

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,450
so I don't want to deceive you anymore.

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,410
That doesn't mean

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,740
I'd like to know such an important secret.

47
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,170
Keeping secrets is exhausting.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,040
Besides,

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,780
why should I care about your surname?

50
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,460
Can a different surname

51
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,310
change who you really are?

52
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm still me.

53
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,290
I'm the same girl you met on day one.

54
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,720
That's all I need to know.

55
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,430
I'll pretend

56
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,320
not to have heard any of that.

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,410
From now on,

58
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,370
we'll behave the exact same way as before.

59
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,170
Since Shen...

60
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,829
your father was an upstanding official,

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,340
I won't blame you
for telling me this secret.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
Then,

63
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,970
Yan Li...

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Don't tell him the truth.

65
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,690
What if he gets drunk someday

66
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,220
and has a slip of the tongue?

67
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,850
Well,

68
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,990
I'll let you in on another secret.

69
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,250
Actually...

70
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,850
I'm older than you!

71
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:28,920
Little Wan'er!

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,029
You...

73
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,540
You kept me in the dark
for the entire time!

74
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,010
How could do you do that?

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
The Ministry of War

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,570
plans to to shift the blame

77
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,330
to those transport commissioners.

78
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,720
Prince Cheng supervises
the Ministry of War.

79
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,180
This is probably his idea.

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
Tell the Dove Unit now

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,360
to find out who in the Shuoxi Army is

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,220
in contact with

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,760
the Transport Bureau of Xibei Prefecture.

84
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,010
I won't let Prince Cheng
easily get away

85
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,450
by sacrificing a scapegoat.

86
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,710
Master, do you suspect

87
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,850
that there's a mole in the Shuoxi Army?

88
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,770
If not,

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,690
how could those transport commissioners

90
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,650
have possibly snuck the moldy grains

91
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,409
into the Shuoxi Army's granary?

92
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,159
Shall we

93
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,660
inform Prince Rui of this matter?

94
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,480
Father

95
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,800
sees all his soldiers as family.

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
If I tell him

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,480
that I'll conduct an investigation
inside the Shuoxi Army,

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,140
do you think he will believe me

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,410
or scold me, accusing me of

100
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,680
eagerly pursuing short-term interests

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,480
and sabotaging our great cause?

102
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,770
Master.

103
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,010
Go.

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,250
For the Shuoxi soldiers

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,340
and the civilians in the border area,

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
we must do what has to be done.

107
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,650
Yes.

108
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,570
Hu Dequan was responsible for
harvesting and producing ice.

109
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,500
He usually lived

110
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,120
in the backyard to watch the ice cellar
for the restaurant.

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,180
Who would've known

112
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,700
he'd freeze to death in the ice cellar?

113
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,409
Did anyone touch anything here?

114
00:05:59,409 --> 00:05:59,970
No.

115
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,240
The owner of Zuixian Restaurant
reported to the prefect's office

116
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,480
right after he discovered the victim.

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,240
Nobody had come in here before we arrived.

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,680
When you reached this place,

119
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,159
was the first door of the ice cellar
already open?

120
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes.

121
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,630
Take an impression of this footprint now.

122
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,040
Could it be...

123
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,640
the victim's footprint?

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,410
No.

125
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,360
Judging from the victim's clothes

126
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
and the soil at the back of his shoes,

127
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,920
the killer must've dragged
the victim's body into here

128
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,450
after killing him outside.

129
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,720
By then, the first door had been
open for a while.

130
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,970
Some ice around had melted into water.

131
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,720
So, the soil attached to the bottoms of
the murderer's shoes turned into mud,

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
leaving footprints all along the way.

133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,240
But since he grabbed the victim
from behind as he walked in,

134
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,490
his footprints were wiped away
by the victim's body.

135
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,800
When the murderer got to this spot,

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,650
the mud on the bottoms of his shoes
was almost all gone.

137
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,310
After he laid the victim down,

138
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
for some reason,

139
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,130
the victim's body exactly
covered the one last footprint,

140
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,040
but he didn't realize it.

141
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,530
Then, the murderer took his shoes off

142
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,390
and left the ice cellar barefoot.

143
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
I just won't tell you.

144
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,070
Little Wan'er carries

145
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,870
the legacy of ancestral wisdom.

146
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,530
The ice punishment...

147
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,210
The killings were indeed arranged

148
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,650
according to the Seven-Layered Inferno.

149
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,510
Your Highness,

150
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,700
the problem is

151
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,900
the Black Unrighteous Flower
is nowhere to be seen.

152
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,650
Close the door now.

153
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,510
Close the door!

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,520
The ice punishment

155
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,480
is designed for

156
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,340
those who betray their families.

157
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,450
Who on earth did this?

158
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,580
Ning,

159
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,760
go with Yan Li to find out

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,690
if the victim got along with
his family and friends.

161
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,240
Got it!

162
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,530
What exactly is going on between them?

163
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,690
Wait up!

164
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,520
Sir,

165
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,850
someone died in the ice cellar
of your restaurant.

166
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,930
I'm afraid your business will be affected.

167
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,660
That's what I'm worried about.

168
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,120
When Hu Dequan was alive,

169
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,720
he was already a menace.

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,480
Now, even his death is causing me trouble.

171
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,540
If I had known this,

172
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,430
I wouldn't have kindly
taken him in at first.

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,290
It sounds like

174
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,620
Hu Dequan wasn't
much of a nice guy, was he?

175
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,850
He used to work as a purchaser
for the restaurant.

176
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,690
His gambling addiction

177
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,090
got him into heavy debts.

178
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,980
Then, he sold his only daughter
to a brothel.

179
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,550
But instead of learning a lesson from it,

180
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,030
he gambled again and lost all that money.

181
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,210
What's worse, the banker broke his legs.

182
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,170
He could barely make a living,
so he turned to me for help.

183
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,400
Out of pity,

184
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
I let him stay in the back quarters

185
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,860
to look after the ice cellar
for the restaurant.

186
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,710
Sir, do you know

187
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,190
which brothel

188
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,210
Hu Dequan sold his daughter to?

189
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,780
I think it was...

190
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,450
Fengqi House.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,260
Don't, Your Highness!

192
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,510
It's okay.

193
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,820
This powder is burned Datura leaves.

194
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,520
It's available at any pharmacy.

195
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,850
Datura leaves?

196
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,850
Does Your Highness mean

197
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,000
the murderer drugged the victim first

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,480
before dragging him into the ice cellar

199
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,280
and letting him freeze to death?

200
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,720
The smile on the victim's face
is the best proof.

201
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,290
Before a man freezes to death,

202
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,210
the blood in him
would start circulating slowly.

203
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,050
Delightful hallucinations are
likely to occur

204
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,050
to relieve the man of physical pain.

205
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,050
That's why smiles tend to
appear on the faces

206
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,580
of those freezing to death.

207
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,480
There are only undergarments
on the victim.

208
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,450
It suggests that he was going to bed
when he was drugged.

209
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,480
In his abode,

210
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,420
there should be residue of
burned Datura leaves.

211
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,170
Got it.

212
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,230
The Datura powder was
placed in the candle wick.

213
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,710
Little Wan'er.

214
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,170
We found

215
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,400
where Hu Dequan sold his daughter to—

216
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,450
Fengqi House.

217
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,850
The first victim also visited

218
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,760
Fengqi House.

219
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,830
The second victim, Zhao Jiaxu,

220
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,690
had a mistress from Fengqi House.

221
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,210
The third victim was
connected to Fengqi House too.

222
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,340
This is our finding.

223
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,520
The link

224
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,180
among these victims
has finally been revealed.

225
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,170
What's the matter, Little Wan'er?

226
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,230
Did you catch a cold in the ice cellar?

227
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,950
I'm usually better than that.

228
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,340
But I've been working cases non-stop
during these days.

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,530
Greetings, Your Highness.

230
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,450
Chi.

231
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,360
Chi.

232
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,120
What are you doing?

233
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,360
It was just a few coughs.

234
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,210
Put me down.

235
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,750
Don't act tough.

236
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,190
Everyone, attention!

237
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,740
Close your eyes!

238
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,690
Turn around!

239
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,070
Do you know when

240
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,090
to avert your eyes?

241
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,810
Yes!

242
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,110
Do you know what

243
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,210
not to say?

244
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes!

245
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,810
Young man,

246
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,930
well done. A bright future awaits you.

247
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,130
Thank Your Highness.

248
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,210
I was only doing my job.

249
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,000
Very good.

250
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,420
What are you looking at?

251
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,480
What's wrong?

252
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,290
Your eyes fixed on him,

253
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,780
like a hungry wolf staring at a fat sheep.

254
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,570
That's not true!

255
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,900
Close your eyes.

256
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,940
Turn around.

257
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,770
Do you know when

258
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,150
to avert your eyes?

259
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,640
Come on.

260
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,170
I prepared

261
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,570
this medicine for you
in the Herbal Garden.

262
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,910
I tried it.

263
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,330
It cures a cold fast.

264
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,820
Here you are.

265
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,520
How's the military provision case going?

266
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,090
I've found out everything they let out.

267
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,290
As for what they don't want to let out,

268
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,360
I'll have it revealed sooner or later.

269
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,530
Just don't worry.

270
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,930
I told Ning about my real identity.

271
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,000
I see.

272
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,040
Get some sleep now.

273
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,520
You'll feel better after sweating a bit.

274
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,120
Come here.

275
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,060
[Qin Residence]

276
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,480
My Lady, you finally woke up.

277
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,810
Are you feeling better?

278
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,360
Come with me now.

279
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,820
People have been waiting.

280
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,980
Just like Yingqi,

281
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,980
they are all from military families.

282
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,730
Feel free

283
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,420
to ask them to do your bidding.

284
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,370
I'm glad to have you guys around.

285
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,970
Pleasure to be working with you.

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,660
Let's go.

287
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,570
Little Wan'er,

288
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,210
I already picked out a guest room.

289
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,590
Don't give it to anyone else.

290
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,990
What guest room?

291
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,280
That's your bedroom, my dearest friend.

292
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,900
What about mine?

293
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,810
What do you have to do with this?

294
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,520
Little Wan'er isn't feeling well.

295
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,320
Why haven't you set out for work?

296
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,180
Where are you two going?

297
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,520
Fengqi House, of course.

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
Li and I will do a good job

299
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,930
investigating the brothel, so don't worry.

300
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,460
Let's go.

301
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,880
Wan,

302
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,540
when you recover,

303
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,800
invite us over for a house warming party!

304
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,450
Let's go inside.

305
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Mr. Zhang,

306
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,450
you're here too.

307
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,570
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

308
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,850
just call me "Zhang."

309
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,560
I think "Mr. Zhang" is better.

310
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,820
I was planning to pick you up tomorrow.

311
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,970
Thank you so much, Lord Yan,

312
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,690
for pulling me out of

313
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,750
that abyss of misery.

314
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,640
He now lives in the side chamber
of the front quarters.

315
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,840
Nobody else knows it.

316
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Without your token,

317
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,980
he can't step out of the premises.

318
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,670
I heard the ice punishment
had appeared today.

319
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,490
I'd better get back to my room

320
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,119
to ponder over the cases in Guanyin Town.

321
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,599
That way, a certain someone will stop

322
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,119
calling me a mercenary fraud.

323
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,530
Don't be afraid.

324
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,260
I'm here.

325
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,880
Ning,

326
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,680
being harsh on them will lead you nowhere.

327
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Don't you see

328
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,570
how scared the girls are?

329
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,510
But what is there to do?

330
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,900
Let me have a try.

331
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,280
Come here.

332
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,160
Sit down.

333
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,100
Look!

334
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,880
What is this?

335
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,210
It's gold!

336
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,250
Do you want it?

337
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,770
Yes.

338
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,580
Those who faithfully do as I say

339
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,160
will be rewarded

340
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,600
with gold.

341
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,490
Back to your spots.

342
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,520
Here comes the first question.

343
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,870
Those who know Wu Qian,

344
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,850
-step forward.
-Mr. Wu?

345
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,660
I know him. I'm familiar with him.

346
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,850
I'm warning you,

347
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,510
don't pretend to know someone you don't,

348
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,960
or you will be

349
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,360
whipped.

350
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,580
This is more like it.

351
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,850
Here's the second question.

352
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,530
Those who know Zhao Jiaxu,

353
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,200
step forward.

354
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,770
The man who paid
to free Zhong Taohua from the brothel?

355
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,360
Exactly.

356
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,720
I know that guy.

357
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,680
So do I.

358
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,570
Very good.

359
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,150
Here comes the last question.

360
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,120
Those who know Hu Dequan,

361
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,960
step forward.

362
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,880
The rest of you may leave.

363
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,920
You three stay.

364
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,440
Let's figure out

365
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,490
who else

366
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,350
has asked you about these three people.

367
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,360
This used to be a high wall.

368
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,150
After my father and Qin Liang
became close friends,

369
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,190
it began to be decorated with flowers.

370
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,280
A small door was opened there
for convenience.

371
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,820
They are secret guards from the Dove Unit.

372
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,600
I thought

373
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,730
this house had been confiscated.

374
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,970
Confiscated properties can be resold.

375
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,290
Lord Shen was an honest officer.

376
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,120
This old house is in a remote location.

377
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,810
Nobles have no interest in it.

378
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,370
Plus, it is related to a case.

379
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,960
So, I was able to buy it

380
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,900
in the name of a brokerage.

381
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,490
Cry it out if you want.

382
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
I know you're upset. Vent it out.

383
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,260
I'm just happy to get back what I lost.

384
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm not upset.

385
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,470
I dreamed about this tree on the carriage.

386
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,770
When I was little,

387
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
when I didn't want to do needlework,

388
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,050
I'd climb up this tree.

389
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,400
My mother, furiously holding a ruler,

390
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,330
would stomp her feet on the ground.

391
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,730
Being punished by a loving mother

392
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,730
is actually a thing to be grateful for.

393
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
If Princess Consort Rui were alive,

394
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,700
I'm sure she would be just like my mother.

395
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
She would love you

396
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,600
and cherish you with all her heart.

397
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
If you misbehaved,

398
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,360
she would discipline you harshly.

399
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,520
Today, I read the files

400
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,770
about my father and Prince Jin
in the Court of Judicial Review.

401
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,810
I know what crimes

402
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,680
they fabricated against my father,

403
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,610
and how they slandered Prince Jin.

404
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,920
This is a battle we must win

405
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,680
at all costs.

406
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,640
Did you notice

407
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
anything odd in those files?

408
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,690
According to the files,

409
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,250
Prince Jin confessed

410
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,280
that he raped and killed Consort Jin
when he was drunk.

411
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,810
But that was not a real confession.

412
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,440
Prince Jin's silence
during the interrogation

413
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,300
was recorded as

414
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,240
"unable to provide an answer."

415
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,700
The files also say,

416
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,670
Prince Jin was standing beside

417
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,400
Consort Jin's body
with a dagger in his hand.

418
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,900
How could someone drunk enough
to commit those heinous crimes

419
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,920
have possibly stood steadily on his feet?

420
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,720
Then in the file about Lord Shen,

421
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,850
did you notice anything suspicious?

422
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,050
The file says

423
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,160
my father hid some physical evidence
of Prince Jin's case.

424
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,810
But it doesn't

425
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,600
specify any items.

426
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,450
Just like Prince Jin,

427
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,920
my father confessed to his crimes

428
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,860
by being "unable to provide an answer."

429
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,900
Li Muyun must've

430
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,650
tampered with those two files.

431
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,520
My father and Prince Jin

432
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,380
would never commit those crimes.

433
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,250
I'm worried this might be
a trap set up by Li Muyun.

434
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,200
If he discovers

435
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,010
you've read Lord Shen's
and Prince Jin's files,

436
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,670
and reports it to the Emperor,

437
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,640
I'm afraid

438
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,220
we'll have to flee and never come back.

439
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,820
I shouldn't have acted so rashly.

440
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,810
Would Li Muyun go to such great lengths

441
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,450
only to test us?

442
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,470
I'm afraid he also wants to identify

443
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,600
those attempting to
reopen Prince Jin's case

444
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,930
and eliminate them all.

445
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,090
Then I'll stay low for a while

446
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,360
to avoid alerting him.

447
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,960
Be patient.

448
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,930
We're getting closer and closer
to the truth.

449
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:07,920
Are you okay?

450
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,360
It hurts.

451
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,600
I'm in pain.

452
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,730
I didn't know it'd break...

453
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,560
Stop talking. It's all your fault.

454
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,490
My bottom hurts terribly.

455
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,200
Put me down now.

456
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Okay, okay.

457
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,950
Master, Your Highness.

458
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,060
What are you two doing here?

459
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,960
Well...

460
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,810
You say it.

461
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,170
I was trying to build a swing chair

462
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,170
in the courtyard.

463
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,230
Unexpectedly,

464
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,530
it couldn't bear two people's weight.

465
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,660
It broke in the end.

466
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,770
Two people, huh?

467
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,060
Your Highness!

468
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,160
Why did you have to be so explicit?

469
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,490
Wan,

470
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,090
go check on Fuling first.

471
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,420
Go to bed early tonight.

472
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,640
The butler

473
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,360
can clean this mess tomorrow.

474
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,770
You and General Bai should get going now.

475
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,100
Don't worry about me...

476
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,090
and Fuling.

477
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,360
Good for you.

478
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,770
Why didn't you share this idea with me?

479
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,040
Master,

480
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,700
you gave the princess
a carriage as a gift already.

481
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,550
I thought it was also time for me

482
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,930
to please my darling, right?

483
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,770
If I fail to delight my darling,

484
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,850
your darling won't be yours anymore.

485
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,620
What does that mean?

486
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,200
Did Princess Yongci
say something to you, Master?

487
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,730
Please don't be mad, Master.

488
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,990
If I come up with a good idea again,

489
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,920
I promise I'll tell you right away!

490
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,400
Let me get through.

491
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,740
I told you to let me get through!

492
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,670
Let go of me. I'm Zhang Dongxuan.

493
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,400
I have something urgent
to tell Princess Yongci!

494
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,340
Nobody can enter the inner quarters
without Master's permission.

495
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,670
Release him.

496
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,770
Your Highness,

497
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,330
where did you recruit these people from?

498
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,960
They assaulted me
without knowing who I am.

499
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,850
If I had been hurt,

500
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,140
let's see how you're going to
explain to Princess Yongci!

501
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,060
Cut the crap.

502
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Why do you want to meet the princess?

503
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,680
I figured out a pattern by studying

504
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,850
the three murders in Guanyin Town.

505
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,500
You're better than I expected.

506
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,800
A man's life will be endangered.

507
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,310
Now is not the time to taunt me,
Your Highness.

508
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,370
My calculation results

509
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,430
indicate that the fourth killing
will happen tonight.

510
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
The fourth killing tonight?

511
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,430
One more than in Guanyin Town?

512
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,850
Yes.

513
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,930
My deductions were made
based on the calendar and the regular way

514
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,850
that the leader
of the Heavenly Way Society acts.

515
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,640
But I can't guarantee the accuracy

516
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,010
of these results.

517
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,250
Following the key principles
of the calendar,

518
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,640
I deduced seven dates.

519
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,250
Tonight, it'll be time

520
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,360
for the fire punishment.

521
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,730
If Your Highness is convinced,

522
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,810
please get prepared soon.

523
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,600
But if not,

524
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
then forget what I just said.

525
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,700
Now,

526
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,680
it is not confirmed
if a murder will happen,

527
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,480
or where and when it will happen.

528
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,010
We must patrol
throughout the night,

529
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,960
so as to discover any fires
as early as possible.

530
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
If a fire happens,

531
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
save lives first!

532
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,640
Yes!

533
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,090
Set out!

534
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,670
Let's go!

535
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
It's 11 p.m. now.

536
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,250
Nothing has happened yet.

537
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,920
Indeed.

538
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,220
What's that place?

539
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,400
That's the Jade Street in the East Market.

540
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,360
Sound the alarm.

541
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,110
Send the fire rescue team there!

542
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,040
Sound the alarm!

543
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,800
How is this possible?

544
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,260
It can't be true.

545
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,610
It can't be true!

546
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,480
Wan.

547
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,050
Yan Chi!

548
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,530
Wan.

549
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,420
Did you have a bad dream?

550
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
I dreamed you were trapped in a fire.

551
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,050
I was terrified.

552
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,820
There really is
a mental rapport between us.

553
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,730
What happened?

554
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,780
Someone received the fire punishment.

555
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,890
Look, it's completely ruined.

556
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,780
I wonder how that man's doing now.

557
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,960
Shouchang!

558
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,810
Shouchang!

559
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,710
Shouchang, Mom is here!

560
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,730
-Shouchang!
-Ma'am...

561
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,730
-Shouchang, Mom is here.
-Ma'am, calm down.

562
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,730
Shouchang!

563
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,330
That's the victim's mother.

564
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,560
The murderer only spread oil
around the victim.

565
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,200
That's why the fire didn't reach
farther places quickly.

566
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,570
Too bad that I arrived too late.

567
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,970
I wasn't able to save him.

568
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,000
Mr. Wang was always meticulous.

569
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,380
How did he let a fire start in his shop?

570
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,160
Could it be related to the recent murders?

571
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,250
That's impossible.

572
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,810
I heard the killer would only
go after bad people.

573
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,290
Mr. Wang was very nice.

574
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,250
How did he get in this kind of trouble?

575
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,120
Maybe he had a dark side you don't know.

576
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,880
Cut it out!

577
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,640
Only a few of us know

578
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,300
the details of these murders.

579
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,530
How did these civilians get to know

580
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,700
that the previous victims were
considered bad people?

581
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,360
Those in the Heavenly Way Society
have the details too.

582
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,960
I suppose they'd let out
the victims' information

583
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,440
before executing them
in the name of serving justice.

584
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,880
If someone in the capital is

585
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,530
using the Heavenly Way Society

586
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,640
to eliminate opponents
and confuse the Emperor,

587
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,700
then I'm afraid

588
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,880
the capital will soon plunge into chaos.

589
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,480
But now we're short of leads.

590
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,410
God knows
when the murderer will be caught.

591
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,470
Don't fret.

592
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,090
That's just a speculation.

593
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,930
Perhaps the situation
won't develop that way.

594
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,460
All you need to do is focus on

595
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,750
searching for leads.

596
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,400
I'll take care of the rest.

597
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,600
Okay.

598
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,740
The suspect of the military provision case
is being escorted to the capital.

599
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,430
During these days,

600
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,640
I may have to spend more time
in the Ministry of War.

601
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,850
I'll have Bai Feng follow you around.

602
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,530
Don't.

603
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,490
That's a rather complicated case.

604
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,880
You need a helpful aide.

605
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,360
Yan Li and Ning are all I need.

606
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,170
Water...

607
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,980
Let me have a sip.

608
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,180
You...

609
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,040
You...

610
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,140
You... you...

611
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,450
What?

612
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,510
What did you do to me?

613
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,120
I...

614
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,920
I...

615
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Stop disgusting me!

616
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,290
I...

617
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,440
What did you do to me?

618
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,680
Did you deliberately get me drunk

619
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,260
to take advantage of me?

620
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,570
My goodness.

621
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,870
Who took advantage of whom exactly?

622
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,810
Come on!

623
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,190
Drink it up.

624
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,360
From now on,

625
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,570
the world will know us as

626
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,520
Yong,

627
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,880
Li—

628
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,050
the legendary detectives.

629
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,340
Cheers!

630
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,630
Yong and Li?

631
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,390
We should be called

632
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,410
the inseparable

633
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,530
duo!

634
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,600
Duo?

635
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,120
Okay.

636
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,940
Drink this up,
and we'll be the inseparable duo.

637
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,340
If you don't, we'll just be Yong and Li!

638
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,360
Deal!

639
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,730
Bottoms up!

640
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,390
Bottoms up!

641
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,850
Li,

642
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,460
listen.

643
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,570
In fact...

644
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,350
except Little Wan'er,

645
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,180
you're the smartest person

646
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,990
in the world.

647
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,770
You bet I am. I know that.

648
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,980
Besides,

649
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,290
I feel

650
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,300
the happiest...

651
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,630
when I'm with you.

652
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
Then...

653
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,040
would you consider

654
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,310
marrying me?

655
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,139
I'm feeling terrible.

656
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,800
Pat my back now, please.

657
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,659
Yong and Li?

658
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,230
What an awful name.

659
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,830
I must be really drunk.

660
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,850
Do you

661
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
really not remember anything?

662
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,159
What should I remember?

663
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,659
All I can remember
is that I felt terribly dizzy yesterday.

664
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,440
Just because I can't recall anything

665
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,610
doesn't mean you can fool me.

666
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,469
I have zero tolerance for deceit!

667
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,650
What can I gain from fooling you?

668
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,550
Look at my face.

669
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,710
I'm the one who suffered a loss.

670
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,290
Stop talking nonsense!

671
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,040
You just won't admit
you took advantage of me, right?

672
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,610
Let's go back to the palace

673
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,440
to meet the Empress Dowager
and the Grand Princess now.

674
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,330
We'll tell them we slept outside
last night

675
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,660
and ask them to decide
which of us is right.

676
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,690
If you ever let out a word about this,

677
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,520
I'll make sure
you don't have any descendants!

678
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,610
If Little Wan'er asks about last night,

679
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,440
just tell her

680
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,410
we spent the whole night
investigating the case.

681
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,740
Do you hear me?

682
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,400
I do. I do.

683
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,770
Plus,

684
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,590
you must forget

685
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,850
everything that happened last night.

686
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,650
Don't ever think about it again!

687
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,080
Ning,

688
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,850
you're wrong.

689
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,590
If I forget it,

690
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,010
my mind will be all empty.

691
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,610
If I'm not allowed to think about it,

692
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,470
then I won't have to forget it.

693
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,050
You two must've had great fun last night.

694
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,230
Why not pay the bill now?

695
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,320
Pay up.

696
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,100
Where is the money?

697
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,870
[Postmortem Report]

698
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,340
Your Highness,

699
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,860
here is the postmortem report.

700
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,850
I have completed the examination.

701
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,090
The victim's arms
wrapped around a bronze pillar.

702
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,020
He was severely burned

703
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,980
from the top of his head
to the bottoms of his feet.

704
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,880
I'm not sure if Datura powder was used.

705
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,160
That said,

706
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,290
there are no signs of a struggle
on the body.

707
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,040
Traces of powder were found in the lungs.

708
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,290
I believe

709
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
the victim

710
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,480
had become unconscious
before the fire was on.

711
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,770
The victim probably
died of smoke inhalation

712
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,900
and burns to organs.

713
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,170
On the back of the body

714
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,920
and in the bed at the crime scene,

715
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,780
I found a small amount of mercury.

716
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,050
That was probably left

717
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,070
after the cinnabar
in the red lead chalks burned.

718
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,590
Your Highness,

719
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,160
did I

720
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
miss anything?

721
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,660
You conducted a through check, Mr. Fang.

722
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,960
I'm flattered.

723
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,860
Your Highness,

724
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,440
to be perfectly candid,

725
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,270
despite my ten-odd years' experience,

726
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,090
I remained a mediocre coroner.

727
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,740
I didn't realize this job

728
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,540
could save lives

729
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
and restore justice for the society

730
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,760
until I met you.

731
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,250
I have no regrets anymore.

732
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,260
Thank you for the hard work.

733
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,810
Ouch! It hurts!

734
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,770
Not so hard, Chi!

735
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,040
-The two of you...
-I'll never do it again!

736
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,810
One is a prince's heir,
and the other a princess.

737
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,880
What a disgrace to fight

738
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,540
in a brothel over a small bill!

739
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,820
Do you even know what humiliation means?

740
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,360
Not so loud.

741
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,060
It'll be a bigger humiliation
if people hear us.

742
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,120
What happened?

743
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,610
-Nothing!
-Nothing!

744
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,760
The two of them

745
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,580
found a lead in Fengqi House.

746
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,290
-Right!
-Right!

747
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,790
Quite an important lead.

748
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,080
The person who knows the three victims

749
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,440
and has asked the girls

750
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,970
at Fengqi House about them

751
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,670
is the carver dismissed by Ranmo Gallery—

752
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,900
-Wang Xin!
-Wang Xin!

753
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,200
A carver doesn't get paid much.

754
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,960
How can Wang Xin afford
frequent visits to Fengqi House?

755
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,770
Little Wan'er,

756
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,250
let me tell you something.

757
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,360
Carvers go to brothels

758
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,770
not to spend money,

759
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,800
but to make money.

760
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,860
The ladies there sometimes

761
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,000
coax those pretentious scholars
into gifting them

762
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,290
seals, jade pendants and such.

763
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,330
When the carvers get paid,

764
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,360
they'll share some profits
with the girls.

765
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,000
Both sides will benefit.

766
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,450
You seem quite familiar with
how things work in brothels.

767
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,960
There's nothing about brothels

768
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,170
that I...

769
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,630
can't find out with money.

770
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,960
Don't even get me started on it.

771
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,520
If you hadn't squandered all the money,

772
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,850
would I have had to wrestle with
those people in the brothel?

773
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,080
Ning, Li,

774
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,850
the information you got is very helpful.

775
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,630
However,

776
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,560
you got drunk during an investigation

777
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
and nearly jeopardized our work.

778
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,610
Merits offset faults.

779
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,660
If you make one more blunder,

780
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,360
I won't let you join me
in future investigations.

781
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,170
Understood?

782
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,600
-Understood.
-Understood.

783
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,320
When I'm in the Ministry of War,

784
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,580
you must keep Wan safe.

785
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,010
Rest assured. With me and Ning here,

786
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,100
Little Wan'er will be safe and sound.

787
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,080
Don't worry.

788
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,070
I'll go with them

789
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,130
to visit Wang Shouchang's mother later.

790
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,650
Okay.

791
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,740
Little Wan'er,

792
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,160
how did you know we got drunk last night?

793
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,100
If not,

794
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,470
how could your smell have got on him?

795
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,010
I didn't say anything.

796
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,850
To be honest, Your Highness,

797
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,960
Shouchang used to be a naughty kid.

798
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,060
At the age of eight,

799
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,690
he burned down an abandoned hut
when he played with fire,

800
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,070
without knowing

801
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,000
an old beggar was in it,
hiding from the cold.

802
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,730
He didn't realize it

803
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,840
until screams reached his ears.

804
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,960
By then, the blaze had become too intense.

805
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,010
Shouchang wanted to rescue the beggar,

806
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,140
but he got cold feet.

807
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,090
Then that old beggar was unfortunately...

808
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,250
What a terrible accident.

809
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,810
Does anyone else know about this?

810
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,690
No, I guess not.

811
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,040
Not a day went by
without Shouchang feeling guilty.

812
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,360
He became more and more quiet.

813
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,140
But he did occasionally

814
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,300
chat with a jade carver named Wang Xin,

815
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,070
who worked in Ranmo Gallery.

816
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,850
Shouchang shouldn't have died.

817
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,960
Wang Shouchang set a fire and took a life.

818
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,610
But that was an honest mistake.

819
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,670
He was not an unscrupulous criminal.

820
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,960
A man who sincerely repented on his wrongs

821
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,520
was tortured and killed brutally.

822
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,520
How can it be justified
as walking the "Heavenly Way"?

823
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,490
The "Heavenly Way" is
defined by a man's thinking.

824
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,290
If a man's thinking strays from
the right track,

825
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,420
then walking the "Heavenly Way"
will become an excuse of lynching others.

826
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,810
I wonder how many members there are
in the Heavenly Way Society.

827
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,360
If every one of them kills innocent people
like Wang Xin does,

828
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,560
won't that make the capital a living hell?

829
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,000
I was going to tell Your Highnesses
about my findings.

830
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,290
Based on the previously
calculated time of murders,

831
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,010
I've roughly deduced

832
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,810
the locations of the seven murders.

833
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,940
How did you figure this out, Mr. Zhang?

834
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,550
A compass?

835
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,620
Exactly.

836
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,680
Your Highnesses, do you know

837
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,310
how the stars move in the sky?

838
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,440
In ancient times,
the 24 solar terms were determined

839
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,560
based on the movement of stars,

840
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,000
which is exemplified by the Big Dipper.

841
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,850
By analyzing the time slots
when the previous four killings happened,

842
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,960
I discovered that the locations
and positions of the murder scenes

843
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,570
exactly matched the shape

844
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,370
of the Big Dipper.

845
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,060
I've marked out the locations

846
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,610
of the three upcoming killings.

847
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:45,170
I'll take my compass with me

848
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,650
and lead the way for Your Highnesses.

849
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,780
How does that sound?

850
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,730
That's great.

851
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,480
The calculation results

852
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,680
suggest that the milling punishment
will happen next.

853
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,120
We can follow the map

854
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,130
to conduct early searches
in places with mills.

855
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,480
I'll ask the Patrol Battalion

856
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,770
to set up defenses
around this location in advance.
