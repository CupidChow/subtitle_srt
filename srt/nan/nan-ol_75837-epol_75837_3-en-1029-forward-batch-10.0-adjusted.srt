00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,359
Where is Meiwan Town?

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,280
Meiwan Town.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,800
Meiwan Town.

5
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,679
Meiwan Town.

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,799
Meiwan Town was annexed
to Pushui in 2004.

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,240
Pushui.

10
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,439
Meiwan Town is in Pushui.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,840
Hello?

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,759
I've arrived in Pushui.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,040
Make arrangements.

15
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,279
Rest assured.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,159
I'll carry her to England if I have to.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,680

18

Mom.

21
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,639
Hello?

22
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,000
The number you dialed is powered off.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,120
Please...

24
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,159
Hello?

25
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,920
Hello, is this Ye Wanru?

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,320
Who is calling?

27
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,799
Shiqiao Traffic Police.

28
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,239
Why didn't anyone

29
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,079
answer my calls?

30
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,159
I'm her son.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,200
What is it about?

32
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,239
Does your mother own

33
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,719
a white-colored vehicle
with a license plate

00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,559

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,120
Yeah. Why?

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,439
It's been parked
on the mountain for days.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,400
Your mother has been

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
unreachable.

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120

Ye Haitang.

47
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,159
I'm coming in.

Your class fund?

00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,240
How did you get that wound?

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
It's nothing.

54
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,440
Tang.

55
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,759
I'm worried about you.

56
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,519
Are you in some kind of trouble?

57
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Tell me if you need help.

58
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,959
I can advance your class fund.

59
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,480
Just tell me the truth.

60
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,759
I'll bring the class fund.

61
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,039
Alright.

62
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,439

Ye Haitang

64
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,639
grabbed a huge knife

65
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
and slashed her dad's neck.

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,120
Blood sprayed all over the wall.

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,920
Her dad had already collapsed,

68
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,480
and Ye Haitang kept chasing him.

69
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,199
No way.

70
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,240
I heard about it too.

72
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,920
My buddy saw it with his own eyes.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,759
She gutted him until his intestines

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
spilled everywhere.

75
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,199
But you said

76
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,079
she slashed his neck.

77
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,639
Yeah, that's inconsistent.

78
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,000
She gutted him afterwards.

79
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,360
Want to tell the story?

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,199
No, sorry. My bad.

81
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,199
Tell us more.

82
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,279
Ye Haitang

83
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,040
was in a blood frenzy.

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,920
Nobody could stop her.

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,480
She attacked everyone

86
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,079
who tried to stop her.

87
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
- How many...
- How many victims were there?

88
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah.

89
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,080
How many?

90
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,800
Five, six... maybe eight?

91
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,120
I don't know the exact death toll.

92
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,120
But she looks so well-behaved.

93
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,399
Why did she lose it?

94
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,119
She was insane.

97

My buddy said

98
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,079
that she's already been arrested.

99
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,200
I think she'll be

100
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,919
executed.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
Executed?

102
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,120
What nonsense.

103
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,759
W-What's your problem?

104
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Come on.

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
Sit.

106
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
That's it.

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,160
Why are you here?

108
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,759
Get back to your seat.

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,120
Don't stand here.

110
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,439
Go away.

111
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,600
Come on.

112
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,319
See? I was telling the truth.

113
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,680
Even Tang Yixun doesn't dare speak up.

114
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,079
Isn't she executed?

115
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,159
Yeah.

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Suspended sentence.

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,199
Tang, your dad came

118
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,120
to see the teacher.

119
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,879
That brat put her up to this.

120
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,399
She came

121
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,639
right at me with a knife.

122
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,479
She stabbed you?

123
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,040
This is serious. Miss Tan,
should we call the police?

124
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,800
I've already smoothed things over.

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,040
I can't let this ruin

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,800
my child's future.

127
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,360
Yeah.

128
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,839
There's definitely something wrong

129
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,160
with your way of education.

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,879
Calm down.

131
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,800
How can I calm down?

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,199
Calm down? Something is wrong.

133
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,680
Ye Yibo.

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Let's go to the office.

135
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,360
Calm down.

136
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
How can I calm down?

137
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,399
My daughter tried to kill me.

138
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,079
Nonsense!

139
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,839
Leave.

140
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,679
Leave.

141
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not nonsense.

142
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,839
Dare you say in front of everyone

143
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,360
where you slept last night?

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,759
Were you with this punk?

145
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,439
Ye Yibo, you're so full of nonsense.

146
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,399
Go ahead. Hit me.

147
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,639
Ye Yibo, come here.

148
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,639
Get over here.

149
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,480
Go on, kill me.

150
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
Seeking violence at school?

151
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,879
Where's the principal?

152
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,319
Get the principal.

153
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,040
Get the principal.

154
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Say that again.

155
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,480
Keep spouting nonsense and I'll...

156
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,360
I want to see the principal.

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,439
Let me speak with him.

158
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,000
Where's the principal?

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
Don't run away.

160
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,399
Everyone. Come on. Back to class.

161
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,680
Back to class.

162
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,520
Back to class.

163
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,240
Mr. Ye, are you okay?

164
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,680
Sir.

165
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,200
You heard what happened.

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,639
He hit me in front of the whole school.

167
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,039
He would have killed me
if people hadn't stopped him.

168
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,279
I'm not embarrassed to say this.

169
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,399
I'm in bad health.

170
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,480
All the money I've earned these years

171
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,799
went to my daughter's education.

172
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,120
I didn't even go to the hospital
when I was sick.

173
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,919
I have no money.

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,280
Mr. Ye.

175
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,759
I'm truly sorry.

176
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,399
We failed in supervision.

177
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,720
Take this money and get a checkup

178
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,919
at the hospital.

179
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,720
I can't accept your money.

180
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,480
I can die for my daughter.

181
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,759
But I won't let a punk

182
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,559
ruin my daughter's future.

183
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,279
Students get away with everything?

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,519
I'll ask the police

185
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,039
to step in.

186
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,600
Mr. Ye, we should
discipline our students.

187
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,159
Rest assured,
we'll address this issue seriously

188
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,759
and get back to you.

189
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,879
Please, take the money

190
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,080
and get yourself checked.

191
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,600
Your health comes first.

192
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,480
I really can't take it.

193
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,759

Go to the hospital.

197
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
Sir.

198
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,960
You're truly reasonable.

199
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,360
I'll count on you one more time.

200

Thank you.

201

Thank you, Miss Tan.

You think this is a pool hall?

205
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,320
Is that why you bring

206
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,559
that gangster mentality here?

207
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,000
What did I do wrong?

208
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,320
Ye Yibo is a bad guy after all.

You want to get kicked out?

211

If you run the school like this,

212
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,639
then you should kick me out.

213
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,240
What's this tantrum about?

214
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,120
You assaulted a parent.

215
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,720

What's your point?

I've been teaching Ye Haitang

225
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,559
since Grade 10,

226
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,679
and I know her well.

227
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,440
Don't tell me you have nothing

228
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,159
to do with her recent troubles.

229
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
Think it over.

230
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,480
Why did your last school kick you out?

231
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,919
I fought hard
to get you this second chance.

232
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,720
And you keep disappointing me.

233
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
What did you promise me?

234

235
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,639
I'm sorry.

236

But if you think I'm the one

237
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,639
causing trouble,

238
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,639
then you can expel me.

239
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,039
I don't care.

245
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,200

Go home.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,759
You're suspended. Go home and reflect.

249
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,360
Go.

He's expelled.

not to expel either of you.

Sorry, sir.

424
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,519
He's gone missing.

425
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,480
I've called the police.

426
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,640
Listen, hiding your father like this

430
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,200
won't solve anything, you know?

431
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,960
I wouldn't

432
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
make up such a terrible lie.

433
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,640
You can check

434
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
with the police station.

435
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,079
I wouldn't make up something like this.

00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,480

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,519
Got a problem?

439
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,160
That old man is ill and missing.

440
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,440
He could even be dead.

441
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
Why are you harassing her,

442
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200

443
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,839

444
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,680
So are you done?

445
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,279
Come back when he's found.

446
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,839
Should I join you here?

447
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,079
Stay back.

448
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,240
- Getting physical?
- Alright, enough.

449
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,799

450
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,720

451
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,319
Fine.

452
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,359

We're living here.

456
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:02,880
Cut our utilities,

457
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
and I'll camp at your office tomorrow.

458
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,119
I swear I'll go there.

459
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:06,519
Get in.

460
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,240
Keep me updated.

461
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,079
Got it, sir.

462
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,160
I'll call you.

463
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
Sorry about that.

465
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,759

Yu Zhiyong, is fake?

466
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,240
Sit down.

467
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,359
Don't startle the baby.

468
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:20,799
Why didn't you

469
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,839
tell me earlier?

470
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,200
I just found out.

471
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,280
Take a look.

472
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,200
What's this?

473
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Just read it.

474
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I'm sorry.

475
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,839
Exhausting every possible method...

476
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,000
It's hopeless.

477
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,599
Try again and again.

478
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,920
A suicide note.

479
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,400
Why would you take someone's

480
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
suicide note?

481
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
I didn't take it.

482
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,480
It literally dropped at my feet

483
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,200
from the shipyard mailbox.

484
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,799
The mailbox was empty

485
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,799
when I checked it.

486
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,799
Then suddenly this fell out.

487
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,119
So it was meant for me.

488
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,560
Look again.

489
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,720
It's not addressed to you.

490
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,519
It says Ye Haitang.

491
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,519
Are you Ye Haitang?

492
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,279
And this.

493
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,119
Look.

494
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,200
The "Tang" character on the postcard

495
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,200
(Ye Haitang)
looks just like this one, right?

496
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,920
They do look the same.

497
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,720
My dad has kept this postcard.

498
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,599
And the handwriting is so similar.

499
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,160
It's very likely

500
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,880
that Ye Haitang wrote this postcard.

501
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,720
My dad kept saying that

502
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,920
he was waiting for a letter.

503
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,799
Now, I received a letter

504
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,599
from Ye Haitang in 1991.

505
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,880
So many coincidences.

506
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
What does it mean?

507
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,319
That's a lot to process.

508
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm just a pregnant lady.

509
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,240
What would I know about this?

510
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,079
What is the deal with this letter?

511
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,440
There's toilet paper, right?

512
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
(Ye Haitang's letter)
Meiwan Town.

513
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,559
Where is Meiwan Town?

514
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,160
Meiwan Town.

515
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,839
Meiwan Town.

516
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,000
Meiwan Town.

517
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:15,408
(Meiwan Town)

518
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:23,152
(Meiwan Town was annexed to Pushui)

519
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,920
Meiwan Town was annexed
to Pushui in 2004.

520
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,559
Pushui.

521
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,200
Pushui.

522
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:39,960
(East Pushui, North Beixing)

523
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,880
Tickets to Pushui.

524
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,039
Meiwan Town is in Pushui.

525
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:56,048
(2026, Pushui)

526
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
(Meiwan Town was beyond this bridge.)

527
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,759
(I used to live here.)

528
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,440
Sir.

529
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
You must know Meiwan Town by heart.

530
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,359
Of course.

531
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,559
I grew up here.

532
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,359
It's a small place.

533
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,559
Everybody knows each other.

534
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,839
Did the locals stay here?

535
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,319
It's hard to say.

536
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,200
My family and many others

537
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,519
moved to the city.

538
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,519
Sir, I'm looking for someone.

539
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,799
Her name is Ye Haitang.

540
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:22,759
She's from Meiwan Town.

541
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,640
She was 19 years old back in 1991.

542
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,440
So she's in her fifties now.

543
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,039
Have you heard of her?

544
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,119
No.

545
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,759
I was only three in 1991.

546
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
She used to live in Meiwan Town.

547
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Could you check her current address?

548
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,880
How do you know her?

549
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,920
She's my aunt.

550
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,559
Sorry.

551
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,880
Only direct family members

552
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,359
get to see the files.

553
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,200
Officer.

554
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,400
She's my relative.

555
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,480
It's something urgent.

556
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,799
Could you please help me?

557
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,440
Sorry, there are rules.

558
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
Please understand that.

559
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,480
Of course.

560
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,159
Thank you, sir.

561
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,680
Hello.

562
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,520
Can I help you?

563
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:14,599
I'm filing a report.

564
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,559
Only direct family members
get to see the files?

565
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,480
Do you know who else

566
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,079
could help me find her?

567
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,559
Ask the local elderly people.

568
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,599
Or search her name online.

569
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,680
I did.

570
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,759
I've done that.

571
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
It keeps showing me pictures
of Haitang flowers.

572
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,599
What should we do?

573
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,480
Why don't you

574
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,279
come back first?

575
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,680
Enough, don't worry.

576
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,000
I'll find a place to stay.

577
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,040
She's been

578
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,759
out of reach since the 8th.

579
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,799
Her car has been parked in the lot

580
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,840
on the mountain.

581
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,240
Her used name was Ye Haitang?

582
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,440
Yeah, it's written here.

583
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,279
Ye Wanru. Used name, Ye Haitang.

584
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,359
A young lady just came and claimed

585
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,359
to be her relative.

586
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,399
What young lady?

587
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,240
The one who just left.

588
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,240
Thank you, sir.

589
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,720
You...

590
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,679
Who are you?

591
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,119
Why are you

592
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,880
looking for Ye Haitang? Who are you?

593
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,759
I'm her relative. Who are you?

594
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,200
What kind of relative?

595
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,679
Hometown fellow.

596
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,760
Where are you from?

597
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,080
What do you want?

598
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,559
I came looking for her

599
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,440
for family matters.

600
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,200
What would bring

601
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,359
a hometown relative

602
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,480
all the way here?

603
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,240
Why do you care

604
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,079
who I'm looking for?

605
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,000
Who are you?

606
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,160
Ye Haitang is my mom.

607
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,720
You're Ye Haitang's son?

608
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,599
Where's your mom?

609
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,720
Tell me the truth.

610
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,759
Why are you looking for my mom?

611
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,200
I can't explain it just yet.

612
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,519
I need to talk to Ye Haitang

613
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,279
in person.

614
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,440
Fine, let's talk it through

615
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,079
in front of the police.

616
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,160
No need.

617
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,240
Sir, let me explain.

618
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,839
I'm not your mom's relative.

619
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,079
But I really need to see her.

620
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:52,799
Wait.

621
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,920
Stop pulling me.

622
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,039
I can explain right here.

623
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,920
Wait, sir.

624
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,200
Why are you dragging me?

625
00:29:57,284 --> 00:30:04,752
(Harmony comes first)

626
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,040
Officer.

627
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,359
I had no idea

628
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,440
his mom was missing, too.

629
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,160
I didn't know his mom.

630
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
If I could reach her,

631
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,319
I wouldn't have come here.

632
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,160
Right?

633
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,200
How does your dad know her?

634
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,440
I came all the way to see her

635
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,400
to figure out how my dad

636
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,319
knows her.

637
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,119
You came all this way because of

638
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,400
this letter and postcard?

639
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,480
Yeah, look at the "Tang" character.

640
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,079
Look at this letter.

641
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,359
Ye Haitang wrote it.

642
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,960
They look identical.

643
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,039
Is it your mom's handwriting?

644
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,599
I'm not sure.

645
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,079
You don't recognize it?

646
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,240
You recognize your dad's?

647
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
Most of his handwriting.

648
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,200
Handwriting

649
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,400
is easy to forge.

650
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
What are you implying?

651
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,279
Why would I fake

652
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,079
your mom's letter?

653
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,000
The officer is here.

654
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,640
Tell me what you want.

655
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,240
I want to find my dad.

656
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,359
Why would I care about you

657
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,279
or your mom?

658
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,319
Sit down.

659
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,880
Don't argue here.

660
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,800
Officer.

661
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
I...

662
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,400
I shouldn't have pretended

663
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,680
to be her relative.

664
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,359
But other than that,

665
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,559
everything else I said was true.

666
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,560
What's so funny?

667
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,560
Enough.

668
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,200
This letter and postcard

669
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,359
don't provide any concrete leads.

670
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,640
We need information

671
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,799
about both elders.

672
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,639
- Sir.
- Come in.

673
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,840
It's been confirmed.

674
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,160
Yu Zhiyong was reported missing

675
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,000
in Beixing

676
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,079
on November 8th.

677
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,920
See?

678
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,119
I was telling the truth.

679
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,480
My dad is missing.

680
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,440
I wasn't lying.

681
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,280
Calm down.

682
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
Tell me.

683
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,400
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

684
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,000
No.

685
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Have your neighbors seen your mom

686
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
these days?

687
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,000
Not at all.

688
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,240
Relatives?

689
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,680
We

690
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,839
don't have relatives here.

691
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
Friends?

692
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,519
I don't know them.

693
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,599
You don't know

694
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,559
any of her friends?

695
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,240
I've been living abroad with my dad.

696
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,200
So I don't know

697
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,040
much about her.

698
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,880
When did you last see your mom?

699
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,280
Two years ago.

700
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,799
Are you her son or not?

701
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,519
I told you

702
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,160
I've been living abroad with my dad.

703
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,799
- So I'm clueless.
- Well done.

704
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,000
Enough.

705
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,040
Listen.

706
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,559
Your mother is a person

707
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,480
with full civil capacity.

708
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,640
She drove to the parking lot.

709
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,720
I totally understand.

710
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,839
But her car was found
in a mountain parking lot,

711
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,799
which is remote

712
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,880
with no cameras.

713
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,920
It's suspicious that she drove

714
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,000
to such a place.

715
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,920
Don't you think so?

716
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,519
But there's no evidence indicating

717
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,960
she's in any danger right now.

718
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,319
So we can't open a case.

719
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:45,799
Why not?

720
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,240
Yu Zhiyong is so shady.

721
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,279
He's tied to my mom's disappearance.

722
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,440
What's your problem?

723
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,599
How is my dad shady?

724
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,960
Your mom is the shady one.

725
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Watch your mouth.

726
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,400
Your dad went missing on the 8th.

727
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
My mom also went missing on that day!

728
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,400
So she's also shady.

729
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,160
Listen.

730
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,279
Based on my experience,

731
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,000
the seniors might have
private matters to deal with.

732
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,119
You know?

733
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,720
Things they can't discuss
with their children.

734
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,759
Go home and try contacting them.

735
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,800
Private matters.

736
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,679
You don't want it?

737
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,759
Then why are you here?

738
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,279
Cat got your tongue?
You were so talkative.

739
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,200
What a pity that Ye Haitang

740
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
raised a son like you.

741
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,599
Watch your words.

742
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,200
Why should I watch my words?

743
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,920
Did I say anything wrong?

744
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,920
You should reflect on yourself.

745
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,960
Your mom is missing. You know nothing.

746
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,319
Yet you were grilling me.

747
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,079
You were living abroad.

748
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,799
Who cares if you live on the moon?

749
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,760
Just go.

750
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,839
I don't need you here.

751
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
What do you mean?

752
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,199
Seriously?

753
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,480
You forgot Chinese

754
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,559
because you lived abroad?

755
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,200
I said you leave.

756
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,400
I don't need your help.

757
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,960
Don't ruin my meal.

758
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,240
Sir.

759
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,759
Finished? That'll be 40 yuan in total.

760
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,000
Sorry.

761
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,400
I don't have cash.

762
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,480
Just scan the code.

763
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
This one, right?

764
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,240
Yeah.

765
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,519
Okay.

766
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,440
Thanks.

767
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,320
What good are you?

768
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,440
Why are you looking for my mom?

769
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,559
Why do you care?

770
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,400
One last chance for you.

771
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,679
I need to check your place now.

772
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
Sure.

773
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,680
How many people?

774
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,640
Just me.

775
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,039
Okay.

776
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,680
Where's your dad?

777
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,680
He's gone.

778
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,039
He passed away?

779
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,760
He's abroad.

780
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,600
They divorced.

781
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,039
I knew it.

782
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,079
Knew what?

783
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,119
It's an online relationship scam
targeting old people.

784
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:29,879
Who's the scammer?

785
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,400
Your mom, of course.

786
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,480
Otherwise, why would

787
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,800
my dad come all this way?

788
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,159
Watch what you said.

789
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,119
What does your mom do?

790
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,600
She's a teacher.

791
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
That explains all the books.

792
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,119
Real intellectual vibe.

793
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,920
My dad has

794
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,119
an identical cookie tin.

795
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,199
Don't mess with her stuff.

796
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,280
Seriously.

797
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,559
Look, it's the same.

798
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,399
It is the same.

799
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,559
Why would they

800
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,079
have identical cookie tins?

801
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,239
What do you think?

802
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,079
What's with that tone of yours?

803
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,399
Where's this from?

804
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:10,880
You think

805
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,079
I faked this photo?

806
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,599
You're well-prepared.

807
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,199
You put some real effort into it.

808
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,440
Are you insane?

809
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,800
This is my first time here.

810
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,400
How would

811
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,800
I know about the cookie tin?

812
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,239
Maybe

813
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,480
you've been here before.

814
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,280
Get to the point.

815
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's see how far you can get.

816
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,240
Fine.

817
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,440
I'll prove you wrong today.

818
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,199
Search this place

819
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,480
and find anything your mom wrote.

820
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,960
I'll get that letter.

821
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,519
Let's compare them

822
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,840
to verify the handwriting.

823
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:56,240
(Handwriting)

824
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
See for yourself.

825
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,400
The "Hai" characters look identical.

826
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,159
See for yourself.

827
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,039
A letter from 1991.

828
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,199
This is 2026.

829
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,519
A letter preserved for 35 years

830
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,639
can't look this new.

831
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,320
I didn't invent the date in 1991.

832
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,079
It's written right there.

833
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,639
Regardless of the year,

834
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,320
everything adds up now.

835
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,519
I just returned today,

836
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,400
and you came.

837
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,079
You're quite something.

838
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,840
Let's talk.

839
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,800
Where's my mom?

840
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,960
Are you saying

841
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,559
that I abducted your mom?

842
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,440
You probably don't know,

843
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
but my mom is sick.

844
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,760
I came back to take her for surgery.

845
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,000
She's in poor condition.

846
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,000
Name a price.

847
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,079
I'll pay you.

848
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,000
And I promise not to

849
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,400
hold your dad responsible.

850
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
My dad has Alzheimer's.

851
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,400
His mind gets foggy sometimes.

852
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,639
How could he abduct your mom?

853
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,920
I don't care what he has.

854
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,519
Bring my mom back.

855
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,880
If you're so certain,

856
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,760
why didn't you

857
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,480
ask the police

858
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,519
to have me arrested?

859
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,480
Afraid I'll kill her?

860
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Save me some time.

861
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,840
Hand over my mom.

862
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,480
I'll agree to any terms.

863
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,559
If anything happens to her,

864
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,199
none of you can

865
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,159
get away with this.

866
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,960
It's like talking to a brick wall.

867
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,320
I'll tell you once more.

868
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,519
This letter

869
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,199
dropped out of an empty mailbox.

870
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,400
That's why I traveled here

871
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,199
to look for my dad.

872
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,519
I don't know how your mom

873
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,440
knows my dad,

874
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,480
but I suspect that they're together now.

875
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,239
I'm going to

876
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:17,960
look for my dad.

877
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,599
You can go

878
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,559
wherever you want.

879
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,359
Give it back to me.

880
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,360
What part of this letter concerns you?

881
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,600
Give it back.

882
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,960
If you're telling the truth,

883
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,000
I believe they might be together.

884
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,159
I'll search with you.

885
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,400
Under two conditions.

886
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,440
You get to set terms?

887
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,360
You'll follow my lead.

888
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,000
Why should I?

889
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,199
And no lies.

890
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,199
Again,

891
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,599
I'm telling the truth.

892
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,559
Come with me

893
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,599
if you don't believe me.

894
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Sure.

895
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,760
From now on, I'll go

896
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,479
wherever you go.

897
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:57,616
(Xiaochun)

898
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,280
Didn't I tell you to buy
a down jacket at the airport?

899
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,360
You'll be crying
from the cold in another hour.

900
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,920
Are you sure trains stop here?

901
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,360
Are you sure this is an actual station?

902
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,679
Of course.

903
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,280
I've taken trains here

904
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,159
so many times.

905
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,320
I've never seen such a station.

906
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,800
China is a vast country.

907
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,079
There are plenty of things

908
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,119
you've never seen.

909
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,000
Do you know geography?

910
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,360
A letter materialized out of thin air.

911
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,960
Do you know physics?

912
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,640
No, I don't.

913
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,559
Consider me illiterate.

914
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,800
You're really something.

915
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,039
You insisted on coming with me.

916
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,000
You can give me

917
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,519
the letter

918
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,359
and leave.

919
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,320
Tighten security measures.

920
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:15,000
Strictly follow the demolition plan.

921
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,639
Dispose of the waste properly.

922
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,479
Greetings, sir.

923
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,079
Assign the tasks.

924
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,159
Don't worry. We'll handle it perfectly.

925
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,559
Here.

926
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,800
Look, the plan is right here.

927
00:40:54,896 --> 00:41:01,412
(Write a letter to your future self.
Join now for 20% off stationery sets)

928
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,880
Excuse me.

929
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,559
Do you charge
for sending letters to the future?

930
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:08,480
No, it's free.

931
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,559
Just drop your letter in the mailbox.

932
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,199
Can I send postcards?

933
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,079
Yeah.

934
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:13,919
Thank you.

935
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:27,888
(Ye Haitang, September 3, 1991)

936
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,840
Cha.

937
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,519
Alright.

938
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,200
Everyone's here.

939
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,160
Line up.

940
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,200
Hurry up.

941
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,439
Bao.

942
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:56,519
The kids are stupid.

943
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,320
Please do me a favor

944
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,479
and let this go.

945
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:00,960
Apologize to Bao.

946
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:02,999
No need.

947
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,960
I didn't come for your apologies.

948
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:19,440
You grown-ups tried to bully kids.

949
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,039
And you couldn't even handle them.

950
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,719
You dare call yourselves my crew?

951
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:31,440
You piss me off.

952
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:42,920
