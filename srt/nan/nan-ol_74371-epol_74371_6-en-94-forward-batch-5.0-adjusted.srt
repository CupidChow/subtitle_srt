[Episode 6]

3
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,080
Prepare the carriage.
We're going to the Marquis Mansion!

4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,720
Yes.

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,970
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,860
Your Highness,

7
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,520
is Wan in the carriage?

8
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,160
Chen, why are you looking for me?

9
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,880
Wan, your sister-in-law
went to visit her family.

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
She started bleeding
the moment she entered the mansion.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,490
The physician said
both she and the baby are in grave danger.

12
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,690
Fuling, go get the medicine box ready.

13
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,420
Understood.

14
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,440
Your Highness,

15
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,310
I'll examine
the Grand Princess another time.

16
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:12,980
I understand.

17
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,680
Go quickly.

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,169
I...

19
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,210
Cut them according to the prescription
and boil them.

20
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,670
Reduce three bowls to one,

21
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,710
and divide it into four doses.

22
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,800
Take three during the day,
and one at night.

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,060
Continue for two days.

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Xinlan,

25
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,010
I've just finished the acupuncture.

26
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,070
Get some sleep now.

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,610
Wan.

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
How is it? Is the baby alright?

29
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,550
Xinlan is stable for now.

30
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,240
But she still needs to take her medicine.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,520
If the bleeding returns,

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,210
we'll have to
perform the acupuncture again.

33
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,490
Great!

34
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,500
Oh my.

35
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,400
Why is this happening?

36
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,970
Thank you, Wan.

37
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,210
It's all thanks to you
that Xinlan and the baby are safe.

38
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,930
Chen, there's no need for that.

39
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,170
Xinlan is weak
in both Qi and blood circulation,

40
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,800
and she's already seven months pregnant.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,020
She shouldn't have made the trip
back to her hometown.

42
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,820
That was an oversight on my part.

43
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,840
Pregnant women are prone to overthinking.

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,040
You'll need to spend more time with her,

45
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,420
so she doesn't fall into melancholy.

46
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,300
Alright.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,560
Your Highness, you're entering
without considering others' opinions.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,730
If word of this gets out,

49
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,610
I'm afraid it could damage the reputation
of the Young Marshal of the Shuoxi Army.

50
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,079
Miss Qin, you've done a commendable job
assisting the Yue family.

51
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,010
I simply wanted to thank

52
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,430
Madam Qin in person.

53
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,340
Please don't mention it, Your Highness.

54
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,579
It's my responsibility as a citizen.

55
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,210
There's one more thing—

56
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,010
Wan!

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,320
Wan,

59
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,450
you saved Xinlan and the baby today.

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,110
This is a little something from us.

61
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,110
Please accept it.

62
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,240
Wan, if you don't accept it,

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,440
it'll feel like you don't like our gift.

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,720
Well, thank you, Chen.

65
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,080
As long as you're happy with it.

66
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,210
I'll take my leave now, Your Highness.

67
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,409
My Lady,

68
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,280
this sapphire jewelry set
is from Jinxiu House.

69
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,570
They usually only take custom orders
from the wealthy and noble.

70
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,120
It's not something
you can get on short notice.

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,050
I believe

72
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,190
this was the head ornament
Chen originally bought for Xinlan.

73
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,640
Young Madam Qin is the second daughter
of the Prefect of Jianzhou.

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,230
I heard she became pregnant
soon after the wedding.

75
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,760
Young Master Qin
seems very pleased about it.

76
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,860
Your Highness,

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,620
how do you know so much
about the affairs of the Qin family?

78
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,280
It's because of you, Miss Qin.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,050
It's only natural
that the Yue and Qin families

80
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,680
will have more interactions in the future.

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,580
I feel it's necessary
to gain a better understanding.

82
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,240
Miss Qin, please don't take offense.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,610
I wonder if my brother
is truly content with this marriage.

84
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,390
What does that have to do
with the Yue family?

85
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,000
Young Madam Qin hasn't fully recovered,

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,360
yet Young Master Qin
didn't stay by her side.

87
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,390
Instead, he rushed to give you
that lavish gift—right in front of me.

88
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,560
It seems that, to him,

89
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,290
the opinion of the royal family

90
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,250
matters more

91
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,490
than his wife's well-being.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
Chen acted under the expectations
of Madam Qin and the Third Madam.

93
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,510
He did it

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,930
for the future of the third branch.

95
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,500
As a man,

96
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,930
he sacrificed his wife and child

97
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,140
for his own ambition.

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,720
This place

99
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,620
was never meant for you.

100
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,430
Would you consider

101
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,409
returning to the capital?

102
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,830
I can make the arrangements.

103
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,260
My father has already been buried.

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
We still have property in the capital.

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,050
I'll go back sooner or later.

106
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
That's great.

107
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,740
In the future,

108
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,550
if I ever need anything,

109
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,760
please

110
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
lend me a hand.

111
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,350
That's what I thought.

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
Your Highness hasn't fully recovered yet.

113
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,120
Please don't fight with anyone—

114
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,520
your wound might reopen.

115
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,230
Miss Qin, if you have time,

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,420
could you help prepare
the first-aid medicine I need?

117
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,280
I'll be leaving

118
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,620
Jingzhou soon.

119
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,210
Are you returning to Shuoxi?

120
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,300
How many days until you depart?

121
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,590
If I rush,
it will take three to five days.

122
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,300
If not, maybe six or seven.

123
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,490
That soon?

124
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,560
It's too late to test the medicine, then.

125
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,800
I'll head to the pharmacy
to gather the herbs.

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,200
Thank you for seeing me off,
Your Highness.

127
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,730
There's no need to be so formal
between us.

128
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,390
From now on,

129
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,150
you can call me Yan Chi.

130
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,460
I wouldn't dare overstep.

131
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,120
After all we've been through together,

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,730
I thought we shared
a certain understanding.

133
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,970
Why still so distant?

134
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,710
I don't dare speak of "understanding"
with Your Highness.

135
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,510
Your Highness is of royal blood—

136
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,910
manners must be upheld.

137
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,250
Master, are we really going back
to Shuoxi?

138
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,450
No.

139
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,970
Then why did you...

140
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,500
Why hasn't Miss Shen's portrait
arrived yet?

141
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,320
Shen Yi dismissed
all his servants before he fled.

142
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,190
Miss Shen had always stayed by
her father's side.

143
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,240
She hadn't been in the capital for long,

144
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,970
and she'd never attended
any poetry gatherings or flower festivals.

145
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,610
No one in the capital has seen her face.

146
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,390
She has a similar temperament.

147
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,400
Forget about her appearance for now.

148
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,530
Send the Eagle Squad

149
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,050
to search along the river
for any trace of her.

150
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,320
Report every single detail

151
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,120
immediately.

152
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,820
Yes.

153
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,750
Someone was spying on Miss Qin
under the cover of night.

154
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,150
Master, how did you know?

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,700
The muddy footprints were made by clogs.

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,530
Judging by the length of the wooden soles,

157
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,170
the person

158
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,770
was likely
around five feet seven inches tall.

159
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,040
Look at the direction of the footprints—

160
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,940
they lead

161
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,030
toward Tinglan Garden.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,460
But why are you certain
it happened at night?

163
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,170
It rained at 5 p.m. yesterday.

164
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,390
If the person had been spying before that,

165
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,950
they wouldn't have worn clogs,

166
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,210
and the footprints
would have been washed away by the rain.

167
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,660
Send word to Yingqi—

168
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,130
have him depart for Jingzhou immediately.

169
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,680
Yes.

170
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,100
Why are there so many herbs

171
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,320
for treating external injuries
in the mansion's pharmacy?

172
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,530
I'm not sure.

173
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,600
Madam Qin oversees
all the medicinal supplies here.

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,930
Those rare herbs

175
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,460
are reserved for
the masters and madams only.

176
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,320
Help!

177
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,250
Someone's dead!

178
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,250
Someone's dead!

179
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,840
My Lady, don't go.

180
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,380
I'll go take a look.

181
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,770
Call for help if there's something wrong.

182
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,080
I'll go with you.

183
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,180
What are you waiting for?

184
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,510
Quickly, come and help!

185
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,780
My Lady!

186
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,250
Turn over.

187
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,340
We're too late—
she's been dead for some time.

188
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,110
Go get help.

189
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,200
Help! Someone's fallen into the water!

190
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,410
Help!

191
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,080
Lianye?

192
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,870
How could it be her?

193
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,970
You know her?

194
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,900
She

195
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,990
is one of Madam Qin's second-class maids.

196
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,650
Who are you?

197
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,200
Why are you here?

198
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,690
I am—

199
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,680
My Lady,

200
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,370
I've brought someone here.

201
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,250
Second Young Master.

202
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,970
Second Young Master?

203
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,370
My Lady, this is your cousin—

204
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,810
Young Master Qin Li from the third branch.

205
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,470
He doesn't often stay at home.

206
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:07,840
Li,

207
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,650
I didn't mean to be rude earlier—
my apologies.

208
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,450
I hope you won't take it to heart.

209
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,930
Not at all.

210
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,720
Don't mention it.

211
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
Second Young Master, Miss Qin.

212
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,630
Wait.

213
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,770
Report it to the authorities first.

214
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,800
We'll handle her after the coroner
has finished the examination.

215
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,530
Understood.

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
Steward Liu.

217
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,640
Lianye?

218
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,590
Miss Qin,

219
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,320
I'll take care of this matter.

220
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,370
You and the Second Young Master
should leave now.

221
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,420
When do you plan
to report it to the authorities?

222
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,020
Lianye is a second-class maid
under Madam Qin.

223
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,260
I'll need Madam Qin's instructions

224
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,550
before I can proceed.

225
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,780
Wan,

226
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,060
Madam Qin has always overseen
the household affairs.

227
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,510
You don't need to worry about it.

228
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,730
It's pouring outside.

229
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,140
Let me escort you back.

230
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,480
My Lady.

231
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,410
Thank you, Steward Liu.

232
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,840
Li, give me the medicine.

233
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,760
Second Young Master,

234
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,600
you must be tired.

235
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Let me wipe your sweat.

236
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
No need.

237
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,650
It's fine, Second Young Master.

238
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,440
Let me wipe it for you.

239
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,150
No need.

240
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,170
Li, let me see.

241
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,960
Let me take a look.

242
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,290
Syphilis?

243
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,020
Please save me, Wan!

244
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,330
Li, did you follow me all this way

245
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,840
just to ask for treatment?

246
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,330
How did you know I was following you?

247
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,880
If you don't want to talk, please leave.

248
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,040
Wan,

249
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,800
I didn't mean any harm.

250
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,650
I've been lingering around
your courtyard all afternoon,

251
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,990
but I didn't have the courage to speak.

252
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,920
When I saw you... heading out,

253
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,810
I followed without thinking.

254
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,330
Please have a seat.

255
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,530
I can get up by myself.

256
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,380
Wan,

257
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,490
I know I'm just
a worthless illegitimate son.

258
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,890
I don't deserve your kindness.

259
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,420
This filthy disease of mine

260
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,190
should never taint your eyes.

261
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,890
But I have no choice.

262
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,900
If word gets out,

263
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,130
even if I survive,

264
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,360
my life will be completely destroyed.

265
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,240
Wan,

266
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,560
for the sake of the years
we spent growing up together,

267
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,680
please help me.

268
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,690
Give me your hand.

269
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,440
How long has it been?

270
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,260
Ten...

271
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,760
Three or four days.

272
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,340
Do you know who passed the illness to you?

273
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,800
Someone from the bro...

274
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,510
Bro...

275
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,330
Wan, stop asking.

276
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,490
I don't want to dirty your ears with it.

277
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,560
If I make it through this,

278
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,660
I swear I'll stay clean

279
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,800
and never go to those messy places again.

280
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,390
You know

281
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,870
this is a serious illness.

282
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,770
I can't guarantee a cure.

283
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,460
As long as you're willing to try,

284
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,720
that alone means the world to me.

285
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,750
I wouldn't ask for anything more.

286
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,530
Li,

287
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,530
I don't have the right medicine
with me now.

288
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,610
Why don't you come back
around this time tomorrow night?

289
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,870
Thank you so much, Wan.

290
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,170
Wan, if you need anything, please tell me.

291
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,570
I'll do anything for you.

292
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,290
Li, you just need to tell me—

293
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,690
is there any purple bamboo
in this mansion?

294
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,140
Behind the pond
is the Purple Bamboo Grove.

295
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,540
Wan, have you forgotten?

296
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,920
Second Young Master,

297
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,080
when Her Ladyship lived here,

298
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,710
she was under five years old.

299
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,020
I do remember seeing the grove,

300
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,540
but I can't recall exactly where it is.

301
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,880
There's no purple bamboo anywhere else

302
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,810
except in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

303
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,870
But Wan,

304
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,210
don't go there.

305
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,110
Grandma issued a ban long ago—

306
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,000
without her permission,

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,940
no one is allowed
to enter the Purple Bamboo Grove.

308
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,730
Why?

309
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,760
Wan, stop asking.

310
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,490
In this household,

311
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,430
the less you know, the better.

312
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,860
I'm leaving.

313
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,480
My Lady, where did you get
the purple bamboo?

314
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,770
From Lianye.

315
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,130
My Lady,

316
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,339
are you going to get involved in this?

317
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,780
What if His Highness

318
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,310
asks us to go to the capital
in the next few days?

319
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,670
We've been planning this for so long.

320
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,000
What if it gets delayed?

321
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:30,329
If that happens,

322
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,079
I'll ask His Highness

323
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,570
to pass on the clues
we found to Prefect Huo.

324
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,410
Anyway,

325
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,810
we can't let Lianye die for nothing.

326
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,770
Since Madam Qin
had already forbidden this place,

327
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,300
why would Lianye come here?

328
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,440
I knew it.

329
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,610
Miss Qin.

330
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,950
What are you doing here?

331
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
I'm not familiar with this mansion.

332
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,000
I went out for a walk early this morning
and lost my way.

333
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,060
Could you point me toward Tinglan Garden,
Steward Liu?

334
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,960
It's that way.

335
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,370
My Lady!

336
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,600
Where have you been this morning?

337
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,490
What happened?

338
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,270
I went to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,460
From the wounds on Lianye,

340
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,090
it looks like she was chased
and attacked there.

341
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,090
She must have seen

342
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,490
something she wasn't supposed to,

343
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,880
and it cost her her life.

344
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,520
Then,

345
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
I saw Steward Liu Chun.

346
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
The way he looked at me was chilling.

347
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,520
I've always found

348
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,260
Liu Chun a bit strange.

349
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,130
Back when he brought gifts
during the festivals,

350
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,930
he would just stare at us.

351
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,940
But he's a long-time servant
of this household.

352
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,810
Could it be...

353
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,580
Could it be that he killed Lianye?

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,640
My Lady,

355
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,930
this place gives me the creeps.

356
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,480
Why don't we

357
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,970
move back
to the Marquis of Anyang's Mansion?

358
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,580
We can't.

359
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,000
We have to stand on our own now.

360
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,470
If we rely on others for everything,

361
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,240
we'll never be able to
hold our heads high.

362
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,940
But...

363
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,130
Don't be afraid.

364
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,350
Just be prepared

365
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,580
and don't let anyone cause trouble.

366
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,730
Why is it so hard to live a peaceful life?

367
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,100
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

368
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,130
Not bad.

369
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,190
It's just that the landslide
looks a bit rough.

370
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,760
I've been on watch all night.

371
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,600
At least I managed to catch the spear.

372
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,860
Did you find anything?

373
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,090
Around 10:30 p.m.,

374
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,440
Qin Li and Miss Qin

375
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,610
went to Tinglan Garden together.

376
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,810
They chatted for a while,
then Qin Li left.

377
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,640
It looked like
he was seeking medical advice.

378
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,300
No one else came by after that.

379
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,300
Seeking medical advice?

380
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,370
Tell Yingqi to keep an eye on her.

381
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,440
Master, let me take over
watching Miss Qin.

382
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,440
Yingqi is still busy investigating

383
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,600
the assassin
who targeted you and the Prince.

384
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,730
We can't afford any delays in our plan.

385
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,800
You want to keep an eye on Fuling,
don't you?

386
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,670
Killing two birds with one stone.

387
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,400
I learned it from you.

388
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,280
I joined the Ministry of Justice

389
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,650
to investigate
the real culprit of Prince Jin's case

390
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,760
and the mastermind behind the plot
to seize the Shuoxi Army.

391
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,810
Miss Qin's autopsy skills

392
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,330
could be a great help to me.

393
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,580
You're clearly using your position
for personal gain,

394
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,240
yet you make it sound so noble.

395
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,150
Your footing is weak.

396
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,970
Go lift the stone lock 200 times.

397
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,680
Seriously?

398
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,940
Miss Qin, you are here.

399
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,700
Miss Fuling.

400
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,500
I need to prepare an emergency remedy
for the Heir of Prince Rui.

401
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,090
I'd like to choose the herbs myself.

402
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,480
Physician Qian, please lead the way.

403
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,090
Alright.

404
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,880
Isn't this the living Bodhisattva,

405
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,070
Miss Qin?

406
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,030
What brings someone of your stature

407
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,750
to our pharmacy today?

408
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,080
Concubine Liu,

409
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,930
Miss Qin is choosing herbs
for the Heir of Prince Rui.

410
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,330
We can't wait any longer.

411
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,960
Miss Qin, you've really climbed up
the ladder, haven't you?

412
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,320
I wonder—
how much does a consultation cost now?

413
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,660
What do you mean, Concubine Liu?

414
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,240
Are you saying

415
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,870
you'd like to consult me?

416
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,670
How would I dare trouble you, Miss Qin?

417
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,380
Just have Physician Qian
prepare my medicine.

418
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,130
I'll choose it myself.

419
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,430
Here.

420
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,930
She was so rude

421
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,480
just because Master Qin An favors her.

422
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,170
But I heard

423
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,080
he's been too sick
to handle anything lately.

424
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,280
Let's see how long her arrogance lasts.

425
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:42,950
Let me do it.

426
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
She's not worth getting angry over.

427
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,290
Let's just focus on our work.

428
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,070
Why is there only one basket?

429
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,200
What if Lord Yan's medicine

430
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,730
gets mixed up
with the Second Young Master's?

431
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,090
We'll sort them out later.

432
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,440
We need to keep a record
of all the herbs we've collected.

433
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,400
By examining the herbs, someone could
figure out the prescription formula.

434
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,340
If we don't mix in Lord Yan's medicine,

435
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,900
Li's condition might be exposed.

436
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,760
Miss Qin, did you find
all the herbs you needed?

437
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,410
The herb supply in the mansion
is quite complete.

438
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,050
Physician Qian, you manage it very well.

439
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,920
It's my duty.

440
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,280
What's wrong with Concubine Liu?

441
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,440
She said her menstrual cycle
has been irregular.

442
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,100
Who prescribed this formula?

443
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,040
I'm not sure.

444
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,430
Miss Qin, do you think it's appropriate?

445
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,140
If Concubine Liu believes it is,
then so be it.

446
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,700
Physician Qian,
please prepare some herbs for me.

447
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,740
Please excuse me.

448
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,360
Follow me.

449
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,130
My Lady, is something wrong
with the prescription?

450
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,260
It seems to cure menstrual disorders,

451
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,330
but in fact,

452
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,950
it's for syphilis.

453
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,100
Could it be...

454
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,530
Second Young Master?

455
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,040
I don't think so.

456
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Li didn't take any medicine before.

457
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,750
[Grace and Purity]

458
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,880
After coming to Miss Qin's courtyard,

459
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,930
be quick with your tasks

460
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,460
and cautious in all things.

461
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,110
Miss Qin, you're back.

462
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,990
Was Madam Qin looking for me?

463
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,400
She heard that Fuling has been
assisting you with diagnoses all day.

464
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,610
Worried that your place
might be short-handed,

465
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,130
she sent two maids to help out.

466
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,440
This is Wantang.

467
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,830
This is Wanxing.

468
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,770
Greetings, Miss Qin.

469
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,770
You may rise.

470
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,920
Are they to your satisfaction, Miss Qin?

471
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,220
Anyone chosen by the Madam
is surely excellent.

472
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,490
As long as you're pleased, Miss Qin.

473
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,070
Madam Qin is waiting for my response,

474
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,410
so I'll take my leave now.

475
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,300
I'll go pay my respects to Madam Qin.

476
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,230
There's no need.

477
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,520
She knows you're busy,

478
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,940
and asked that you take some time to rest.

479
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,880
Thank you.

480
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,930
Fuling,

481
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,720
let me do it.

482
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,450
Arrange for them to stay here.

483
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,070
Yes.

484
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,970
Follow me.

485
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,180
-Yes.
-Yes.

486
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,370
My Lady,

487
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,460
the two girls have settled in.

488
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,300
Madam Qin sent someone over so suddenly—

489
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,850
she must be trying
to find out your whereabouts.

490
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,450
Someone searched this room,

491
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,500
but none of the papers or books
were touched.

492
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,870
That means they're not suspicious
of my identity yet.

493
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,330
I ran into Liu Chun this morning
in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

494
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,530
Now they've planted two new girls here.

495
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,670
I don't know who they're working for,

496
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,940
but they're definitely connected to
Lianye's death.

497
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,830
Guard the house

498
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,830
and keep an eye
on who they are in contact with.

499
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,490
Got it. Rest assured, My Lady.

500
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,330
Get out!

501
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,000
Leave!

502
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,140
Go back and tell Marquis Song:

503
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,760
His Majesty has already shown mercy—

504
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,720
he's merely demoting him from Duke

505
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,410
to Marquis.

506
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
But if he keeps pestering me,

507
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,170
one word from me is enough

508
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,370
to turn the Marquis Mansion
into the Song Mansion.

509
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,030
Get lost!

510
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,240
Chi,

511
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,000
the power struggle
between Prince Cheng and the Crown Prince

512
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,860
is already coming to the surface.

513
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,180
The Shuoxi Army holds
half of the nation's military strength—

514
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,700
everyone's eyeing it
like a juicy piece of meat.

515
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,760
You may have His Majesty's favor now,

516
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,290
but your words just now

517
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,780
were a bit too bold.

518
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,810
I'm afraid someone might use that
against you.

519
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,870
Before I came here,

520
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,480
His Majesty gave orders: The Shuoxi Army
may be summoned but not relocated.

521
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,370
That level of trust is unheard of.

522
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,770
But make no mistake—
it's like setting my father on fire.

523
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,680
Still, my father wouldn't listen.

524
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,630
He wanted to earn military merit
to repay the Emperor's grace.

525
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,290
In such a volatile situation,

526
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,190
with me as the heir
gaining so much attention,

527
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,660
I fear His Majesty won't tolerate

528
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
the presence of my father and me.

529
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,450
It hasn't been easy for you.

530
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,450
But alas, Prince Rui lacks your foresight.

531
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,660
My father is brave and loyal.

532
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,470
He mistook my intentions

533
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,900
for scheming.

534
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,990
Prince Rui is not an inflexible man.

535
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,990
I believe that one day,

536
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,200
he will understand your efforts.

537
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:17,980
I hope so.

538
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,250
I only pray he sees it
before it's too late.

539
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,780
My Lady,

540
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,790
those two have fallen asleep.

541
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,550
Guard the back window.

542
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,960
If you see Li, let him in.

543
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,150
Second Young Master, please come in.

544
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,670
Wan.

545
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,180
I...

546
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,400
Look.

547
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,420
It's only been a day.

548
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,880
Why has it gotten so much worse?

549
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,980
Wan, am I hopeless?

550
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,060
No.

551
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,130
But you need to be honest with me.

552
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,680
Is your illness truly unrelated to
anyone in the mansion?

553
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,850
I swear to God.

554
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,430
My wife resents the idea
of me taking concubines—

555
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,200
I don't even have a consummation maid.

556
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,410
How could I possibly dare approach
any of the women in this household?

557
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,940
Wan, you have to believe me.

558
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,680
Trust me!

559
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,580
It's not that I don't believe you.

560
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,720
But this prescription
isn’t interchangeable between genders.

561
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,930
If the disease was passed on
to someone else,

562
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,660
I'm afraid your secret
won't stay hidden for long.

563
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,610
Are you telling the truth?

564
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,510
I am.

565
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,620
Wan, just treat me alone.

566
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,560
That's great.

567
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,400
I've placed the prescription
in the package.

568
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
These ointments are for the ulcers.

569
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,800
Make sure to apply them exactly
as I instructed.

570
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,370
Come back to me once you've finished them.

571
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,240
Thank you, Wan.

572
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,240
I'm leaving.

573
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,440
Li,

574
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,000
do you know

575
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,480
why the Purple Bamboo Grove
became a forbidden place?

576
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,720
I really don't want to lie to you,

577
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,200
but as an illegitimate son,

578
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,520
there are some things
I dare not speak carelessly.

579
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,700
Wan, stop asking.

580
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,330
Just stay away from Purple Bamboo Grove.

581
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,340
Thank you for telling me the truth, Li.

582
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,130
I'm leaving.

583
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,680
Looks like
we must go to Purple Bamboo Grove.

584
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,909
Concubine Liu?

585
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,520
Could it be that

586
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,170
Lianye saw
Concubine Liu meeting someone here

587
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,170
so she was killed?

588
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,139
Miss Qin, have you forgotten?

589
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
This place is forbidden.

590
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,650
Anyone who trespasses will be punished.

591
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,120
I...

592
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,409
I just...

593
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,190
My Lady!

594
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,590
My Lady.

595
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,600
Miss Qin,

596
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,420
Physician Qian has arrived.

597
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,090
We can go get the medicine.

598
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,610
Got it.

599
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,120
Steward Liu, what else can I do for you?

600
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,370
It's been raining a lot lately.

601
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,070
We are cleaning up the mud.

602
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,000
This place is very filthy.

603
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,060
It's better for you
to not simply walk around, Miss Qin.

604
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,310
Wanxing,

605
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,100
how did you know
I was in Purple Bamboo Grove?

606
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,890
Fuling asked me to follow you,

607
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,560
so I followed you.

608
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,290
Why didn't I see you on the way?

609
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
I have no idea.

610
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Don't follow me in the future

611
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,610
without my instruction.

612
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:12,860
Understood.

613
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,850
Go away!

614
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,120
If you come any closer,

615
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,810
I'll die in front of you.

616
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,250
Qin Shuang?

617
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
Calm down, My Lady.

618
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,000
My Lady!

619
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,260
Put down the scissors!

620
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,520
Go away! All of you!

621
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,920
If you come any closer,
I'll die in front of you.

622
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,440
Shuang, put down the scissors first.

623
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,740
I have been repenting for so long.

624
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,850
Why are you still locking me up?

625
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,160
I asked the maid to beg you every day.

626
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,930
Why wouldn't you see me?

627
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,080
Shuang.

628
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,450
Shuang, put down the scissors first.

629
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,450
Put them down.

630
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,930
Let's talk in the yard.

631
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,490
I punish you

632
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,800
for your own good.

633
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,180
Think about it.

634
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,070
You offended the Grand Princess.

635
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,440
If I don't punish you by locking you up

636
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,330
to vent the Grand Princess's anger,

637
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,650
what should we do?

638
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,310
If it's for my own good,

639
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,060
why didn't you and Xiang come to see me?

640
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,660
Shuang,

641
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,440
I'm a young lady of the Qin family,

642
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,360
not a criminal.

643
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,950
Why are you doing this to me?

644
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,460
You don't look like
the young lady of the Qin family.

645
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,750
If this continues,

646
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,790
our whole family will be humiliated.

647
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,820
I don't have a good life anyway.

648
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,890
Instead,

649
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,960
I'd rather...

650
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,760
I'd rather...

651
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,330
Shuang!

652
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,330
Mother!

653
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,500
Help!

654
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,560
Untie the rope.

655
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,210
Yes.

656
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,570
Throw it down!

657
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,280
-Help!
-Mother.

658
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,650
Put it down.

659
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,160
Madam, please forgive me.

660
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,730
The well
was supposed to be completed today,

661
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,730
so the water has been drained.

662
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,930
We were taking care of the mud.

663
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,000
But Miss Qin Shuang

664
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,890
suddenly...

665
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,440
What's the use of saying this now?

666
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,250
Hurry up and save her!

667
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,250
Go!

668
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,080
Help! It's so dark here!

669
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,690
Help!

670
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,440
I'm going to sink in the mud.

671
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,220
What a sin!

672
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,320
Shuang, we put the rope down.

673
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,480
You tie it around your waist.

674
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,680
We'll pull you up now.

675
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,350
I'm done.

676
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,250
Pull!

677
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,700
Wait!

678
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,560
I'm stuck!

679
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,040
A dead man!

680
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,620
I'm caught! Pull me up!

681
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,520
There's no dead person.

682
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,480
How could there
be bones of dead people in the well?

683
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,770
-Pull it up!
-Hurry up!

684
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,000
Hurry up.

685
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,400
Harder.

686
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,470
Be careful.

687
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,380
Hurry up!

688
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,180
Help her out!

689
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,850
Be careful.

690
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,210
Come on.

691
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,870
Quickly, help her over there.

692
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,730
Help her sit down.

693
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,440
A dead person... I saw a dead person.

694
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,210
Wan, there's a dead person in the well.

695
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,810
There are
bones of dead people in the well.

696
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,330
Look at her.

697
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,800
She's so scared
that she's talking nonsense.

698
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,210
There are
no bones of dead people in the well.

699
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,040
Mother.

700
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,070
There really are
bones of dead people down there.

701
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

702
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,290
He grabbed my skirt.

703
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,730
All white bones.

704
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,850
That's enough.

705
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,800
Concubine Liu is here.

706
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,700
Aunt,

707
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,150
better let the servants
go down and have a look.

708
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,410
So many people are watching.

709
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,340
We can't hide it.

710
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,790
It's even worse for them
to talk nonsense outside.

711
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,940
Yes, you're so thoughtful.

712
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,780
Liu Chun.

713
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:42,210
Yes.

714
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,530
Find someone to go down and have a look.

715
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,690
Yes. Come.

716
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,510
Alright.

717
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,560
Are you hurt?

718
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,800
-Don't be afraid.
-I'm fine.

719
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,320
It's alright.

720
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,040
Madam, we've searched everywhere.

721
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,410
There's nothing else

722
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,340
other than the withered branches.

723
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,080
Got it.

724
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,260
Get someone to clean the well,

725
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,390
so that you won't harm others again.

726
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,480
Look at you.

727
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,760
You're really something.

728
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,360
You're taking a withered branch
as a dead bone.

729
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,210
Don't mess around anymore.

730
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,120
Got it?

731
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,610
But I saw it with my own eyes.

732
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,640
Enough.

733
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,120
Mother,

734
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,520
will you still lock me up?

735
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,430
Go back and rest for a few days.

736
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,310
Wan,

737
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,240
you must be tired today.

738
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,530
Go back and rest.

739
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,400
Let's go.

740
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Mother, let's go.

741
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,000
Wan, why are you still holding that?

742
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,850
Just throw it away.

743
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,120
I don't want to see it.

744
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,880
Wan.

745
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,670
I treated you badly before.

746
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,220
Why did you help me?

747
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,110
We are sisters.

748
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,970
Besides, you didn't hurt me.

749
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,560
After this incident,

750
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,490
don't do anything stupid anymore.

751
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,890
My Lady,

752
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,810
are there really human bones

753
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,470
in the well in the flower shed?

754
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,380
Human bones are white,

755
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,980
yet the withered branches look black.

756
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,640
Even if Qin Shuang was afraid,

757
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,250
she would still be able to
differentiate that.

758
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,270
The Qin family is so scary.

759
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,370
You must not

760
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,030
wander around alone anymore.

761
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,850
Am I alone?

762
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,190
Didn't you ask Wanxing to follow me?

763
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,820
I was worried about her in the room,

764
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,080
so I let her follow you.

765
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,280
Wanxing may be timid,

766
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,050
but she is quick-witted.

767
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,370
She doesn't follow rules like Wantang.

768
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,570
If you don't like her,

769
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,320
I'll ask Wantang to follow you.

770
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,420
No need.

771
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,450
I want to see what she really wants to do.

772
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,420
My Lady, can we go back
to the capital early?

773
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,890
The more I live here,
the more scared I am.

774
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,690
What are you afraid of?

775
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,250
Evil prevails over justice.

776
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,170
Besides,

777
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,800
when we go to the capital

778
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,100
depends on Lord Yan.

779
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,080
Be patient.
