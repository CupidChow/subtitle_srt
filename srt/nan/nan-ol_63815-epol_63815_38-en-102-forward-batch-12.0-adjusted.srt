Summon the Cabinet

41
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,550
to the court immediately

42
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,470
for Duke Huai's Bloodshed Case.

43
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,510
Yes.

44
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,390
Lin'an,

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,830
what's the emergency?

46
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,310
Brother,

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,720
Father won't admit...

48
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,270
He won't admit

49
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,110
Uncle created

50
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,640
the bloodshed in Chuzhou, will he?

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Brother...

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Don't forget who you are.

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,550
This isn't your concern.

54
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,960
Can't you be like Huaiqing?

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,040
She's been silent.

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,880
Why?

57
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,800
Isn't it true that Uncle killed those people?

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Shut up!

59
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,950
Lin'an,

60
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,110
Father adores you

61
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,870
because you're a sweet girl,

62
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,040
and you never interfere in state affairs.

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
But now,

64
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,390
how come you've changed?

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,830
Are you getting involved

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,670
because of Xu Qi'an?

67
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,270
He incited you, didn't he?

68
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,550
He didn't do anything.

69
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,960
I haven't seen him for days.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,920
I can't see him.

71
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,390
I feel guilty.

72
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,520
Duke Huai is my uncle.

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,960
He committed such atrocities in Chuzhou.

74
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,200
We're family.

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
How could I stay out of this?

76
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,480
So

77
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,110
did you ask to see me

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,710
to make me

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,670
remonstrate with Father?

80
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,240
Father wouldn't see you,

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,110
let alone me.

82
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,200
Lin'an,

83
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,360
there's no right or wrong in court.

84
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,040
Only gains and losses matter.

85
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,320
Whether or not my words
carry weight is one thing.

86
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,150
As the Crown Prince,

87
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,000
I must stand four-square

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,910
with the nobility and imperial clansmen.

89
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
You're a princess.

90
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,910
No one cares about what you do.

91
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,150
Were you a prince,

92
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,640
those words of yours would cost you

93
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,030
your chance of coming to the throne.

94
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,790
But he murdered so many people.

95
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,420
Hundreds of thousands of them!

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
Shouldn't he pay for their deaths?

97
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Or who'd be in awe of the Dafeng royalty

98
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,230
and the law of the Dafeng?

99
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,470
There were, there are, and there will be

100
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,710
tons of such things.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,590
Once Father makes the decision,

102
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,760
no one can change it.

103
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,470
Listen, silly,

104
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,000
Father's throne was

105
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,120
built on bones and blood.

106
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,120
If we didn't come,

107
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,710
our imperial image
built in the last 600 years

108
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,760
would be ruined by you.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,910
My Lord,

110
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,680
Duke Zhenbei killed
all the people of Chuzhou.

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,150
Those 380,000 souls need justice.

112
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,080
Everyone else in our state needs justice.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,060
(Duke Cheng, Imperial Clansman)
After the Battle

114
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,760
of Linyuan Pass, Duke Zhenbei was ordered

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
to guard the northern border.

116
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,320
Now that he's dead,

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,030
can't we keep

118
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,440
his posthumous name intact?

119
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,830
His merits can't offset his crimes.

120
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,110
Your Majesty,

121
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,230
it's true that he safeguarded our state,

122
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,960
but it's also true
that he was guilty beyond forgiveness.

123
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,030
He shall be punished.

124
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,500
Your Majesty, Wang Zhenwen

125
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,780
(Duke Lu, Imperial Clansman)
is defaming a duke in public.

126
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,890
That's a capital crime.

127
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,760
Dukes,

128
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,390
think carefully about this case.

129
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,390
(Duke Li, Imperial Clansman)

130
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,560
You're a lowly eunuch.

131
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,470
Without His Majesty's appreciation,

132
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,790
you wouldn't have the right to speak here.

133
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm grateful for Your Majesty's kindness.

134
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,230
However,

135
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,230
for the sake of the imperial image,

136
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,280
the Dukes

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,470
shouldn't try to cover up this case.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,440
Yesterday, the three masters of the Academy

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,710
meant to come

140
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,390
to rebuke Your Majesty.

141
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,470
I stopped them.

142
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
They said

143
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,880
now that

144
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,470
Duke Huai killed the people of Chuzhou,

145
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,520
the Academy

146
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,350
would write down his crimes

147
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,120
in history

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,270
to warn future generations.

149
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,830
How the Dukes

150
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,880
covered for him today

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,440
would also be engraved in it

152
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,440
in full detail.

153
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,760
Duke Li,

154
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,960
you've always been proud

155
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
and erudite.

156
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,790
You're a role model for Imperial Clansmen

157
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,350
and every student in the state.

158
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,560
Would you rather see

159
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,640
the Yunlu Academy write down

160
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,640
how you covered for a murderer

161
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,000
and be condemned forever?

162
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,030
How dare you threaten me!

163
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,440
Are you being rebellious?

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,440
When did advice become a threat?

165
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
You...

166
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,830
All of you...

167
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
Your Majesty,

168
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,790
permission to speak.

169
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,910
Simu said,

170
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,560
His Majesty held a sudden meeting earlier

171
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
to discuss Duke Huai's Bloodshed Case.

172
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
How did it go? What's the conclusion?

173
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,560
Officials didn't win,

174
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,320
but neither did His Majesty.

175
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,230
The debate would drag on and on.

176
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,680
Unexpectedly,

177
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,150
State Duke Cao stepped forward

178
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,270
to speak up.

179
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
Your Majesty,

180
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,990
over the years, we've been
having internal and external troubles.

181
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,150
People have been struggling.

182
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,440
Tax arrears keep building up.

183
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,150
Despite your unceasing tax cuts

184
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,440
to ease people's burden,

185
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,390
complaints are heard everywhere.

186
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,350
At this time,

187
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,590
if they knew about the bloodshed,

188
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,120
what would they think about the court?

189
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,790
What would squires and petty officials think?

190
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,910
Would they think

191
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,590
the court was hopeless

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,960
and do worse

193
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,630
in exploiting the people

194
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,560
even more brazenly?

195
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,440
How bold!

196
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,400
Are you calling me fatuous

197
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,110
and the officials

198
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
blind and incompetent?

199
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,200
I wouldn't dare.

200
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,960
But aren't the officials

201
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,510
acting as if they're blind and incompetent?

202
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,040
They keep shouting

203
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,590
to uphold justice for the people

204
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,830
and convict the culprit now.

205
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,080
Has anyone considered the bigger picture?

206
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,110
As court officials,

207
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,470
don't you know the image of the court

208
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,680
also represents your image?

209
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,510
But Duke Zhenbei

210
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,800
was indeed guilty.

211
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,960
Your Majesty,

212
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,590
Duke Zhenbei is...

213
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,470
is already dead.

214
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,710
Can death erase everything?

215
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,710
Yes.

216
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,750
Chuzhou was harassed by Kui for years.

217
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,830
The city fell into ruin.

218
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,750
When Kui seized it,

219
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,560
Duke Zhenbei put up a desperate struggle,

220
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,110
battling the chief of Kui alone.

221
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,800
He killed the Mighty Bone

222
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,200
and guarded the gate of the Dafeng

223
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
to the end.

224
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,470
He fell with the city

225
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,160
and died heroically!

226
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
After that war,

227
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,560
Chuzhou will enjoy over ten years

228
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,870
or tens of years of peace.

229
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,550
Your Majesty,

230
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,230
he died a worthy death.

231
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
He's a hero of the Dafeng!

232
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,350
Your Majesty!

233
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,200
State Duke Cao,

234
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,830
did you forget

235
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,960
not only I witnessed the bloodshed?

236
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,280
The...

237
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,990
the mission,

238
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,990
those 20,000 troops in Chuzhou,

239
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,040
and the people in the capital all know it!

240
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,430
Can you...

241
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,670
can you...

242
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,680
can you keep all of them quiet?

243
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,110
They used the images of the court and royalty

244
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,560
and the chief of Kui's death as leverage.

245
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,400
Although Chuzhou fell,

246
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,440
that was all Kui's fault.

247
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,750
What a wonderful chain.

248
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,990
It sounds reasonable.

249
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,830
In that case,

250
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,750
the fall of Chuzhou wouldn't be intolerable.

251
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,990
It happened all because of war

252
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,110
and Kui.

253
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,870
Duke Huai would turn from a murderer

254
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,160
to a hero and guardian of the Dafeng

255
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,110
who even killed the chief of Kui.

256
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,560
That was a great merit.

257
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,190
- Wait!
- Wait!

258
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,160
You first, Ningyan.

259
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,280
This plan wasn't too bad,

260
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,320
but it'd hold the officials back at most.

261
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,750
The sharp ones could easily tell

262
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,870
that was His Majesty's show.

263
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,710
Correct.

264
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,680
Mr. Zheng's last line is the point.

265
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,710
Many people know about the bloodshed.

266
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,800
Could such a self-deceiving show

267
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,470
silence everyone?

268
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,320
He started paving the way a long time ago.

269
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,110
He knew it couldn't.

270
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,470
Was all this

271
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,200
also to lay the groundwork?

272
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,200
Does His Majesty have

273
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,920
more cards up his sleeve?

274
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
After Duke Huai died,

275
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,800
the North lost the sky-propping pillar.

276
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,750
Kui can't stir up more trouble,

277
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,080
but

278
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,040
The Witcher's Sect

279
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,750
can go around

280
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,160
Chuzhou

281
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,750
and head straight to the capital

282
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,920
to deal a death blow.

283
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,160
The sky-propping pillar is too big

284
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,630
and hard to control.

285
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,230
Once it falls,

286
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,470
it'll be

287
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
lose-lose.

288
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,400
Is that so?

289
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
Your Majesty,

290
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,590
reports from every palace said

291
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,710
no one was harmed.

292
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,800
Nothing was stolen.

293
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,510
Has the assassin been seized?

294
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,990
Your Majesty,

295
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,120
not yet.

296
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,200
Keep looking.

297
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,040
Yes.

298
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,320
An assassin broke in?

299
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,400
Why

300
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,230
didn't I know?

301
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,590
I kept it quiet, telling them

302
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,230
not to make a fuss.

303
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,750
It happened suddenly,

304
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,990
causing panic in the Palace.

305
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,040
Even the Empress

306
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,800
was frightened.

307
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,830
The assassin must be caught quickly

308
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,320
to put an end to this matter.

309
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,760
The Empress

310
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,230
can stop worrying.

311
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,320
Your chess skills

312
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,750
have further advanced, Your Majesty.

313
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,470
Are you giving up?

314
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,760
Another around.

315
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,170
(Edict, Prime Minster Wang Zhenwen)

316
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,330
(is guilty of malpractice.)

317
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,800
(He's removed from office. The end.)

318
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,220
(Looking up, one can face the heavens.
Looking down, one won't disappoint...)

319
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,830
Court adjourned.

320
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,110
Good day, Your Majesty.

321
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,710
Your Majesty...

322
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,560
I'm tired.

323
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,110
So are you.

324
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,630
I implore you to convict Duke Zhenbei!

325
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,160
Mr. Zheng.

326
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,590
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

327
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,350
Mr. Zheng,

328
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,100
you left Chuzhou without permission

329
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,360
to seek justice in the capital,

330
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,540
thinking you'd win for sure.

331
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,960
Did you think

332
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,300
you'd end up like this?

333
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,160
Here's my advice.

334
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,520
Mr. Zheng,

335
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,590
Chuzhou has been destroyed.

336
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,200
You should stay there

337
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,040
to rebuild the city.

338
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,800
Stay out of

339
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,110
the things in the capital.

340
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,630
That's also His Majesty's thought.

341
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,230
You're shameless.

342
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,710
What can I do?

343
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,440
That old geezer.

344
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,230
How stupid!

345
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,080
When you came back

346
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,800
to report on your work after the inspection,

347
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,200
we met once.

348
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,710
Back then,

349
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,960
you were gray-haired

350
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,880
but vigorous.

351
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:26,960
Lord Wei,

352
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,470
are you also giving up?

353
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,030
Xu Qi'an

354
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,790
is a valuable talent.

355
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,440
I believe

356
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,990
he's a born Fighter.

357
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,360
His temper and character
can give me a headache, though.

358
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,230
I told him

359
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,880
to survive in the official circles,

360
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,550
think about three things.

361
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,710
Danger,

362
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,360
retreat,

363
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,030
and change.

364
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,750
Before taking action,

365
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,360
think about the consequences

366
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,470
and what's involved.

367
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Weigh the pros and cons

368
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,550
before engaging in

369
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,600
or giving up.

370
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,230
If you can't stop what's coming your way,

371
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,960
then retreat.

372
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,960
Take a step back.

373
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,790
But Xu Qi'an said,

374
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,640
"Lord Wei,

375
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,840
I understand all that,

376
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,640
but

377
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,310
I don't care."

378
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,840
What a boorish Fighter.

379
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,440
If you call him "boorish",

380
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,120
that means you can't change him.

381
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,310
Step back

382
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,750
to be safe.

383
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,470
When you're safe,

384
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,310
you can think about

385
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,750
how to change the situation.

386
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,990
There's still room to turn the tide.

387
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,710
Mr. Zheng,

388
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,680
why not take a step back

389
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,360
and take things slow?

390
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,020
(Wang Mansion)

391
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,840
Commissioner of Chuzhou, Zheng Xinghuai,

392
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,680
would like to see Prime Minister Wang.

393
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,070
He's with a guest at the moment.

394
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,790
He won't be able to see you soon.

395
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,030
Commissioner Zheng,

396
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,550
you should go.

397
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,870
Sir.

398
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,880
Go to the Secretary of War's Mansion.

399
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,310
Yes.

400
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,140
(Wang Mansion)

401
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,740
(Ministry of War)

402
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,520
Sir.

403
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,980
(Ministry of War)

404
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,820
(Censorate)

405
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,660
(Court of Judicial Review)

406
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,470
Sir, it's getting dark.

407
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,200
Let's go.

408
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,540
(Court of Judicial Review)

409
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,580
(Juyi Inn)

410
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,350
Mr. Xu.

411
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,110
Mr. Zheng.

412
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,200
Sorry,

413
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,810
I disappointed you.

414
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,230
The streets are packed.

415
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,360
It's the Dragon Boat Festival.

416
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,030
Earlier today,

417
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,600
I went to see Lord Wei.

418
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,470
So did I.

419
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,520
Mr. Xu,

420
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,200
how about

421
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,990
we eat plain noodles? My treat.

422
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,460
(Noodles)

423
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,350
Mr. Zheng,

424
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,960
I'm not hungry.

425
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,120
I am.

426
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,790
- Enjoy.
- This is a specialty of Jiangnan.

427
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,310
It's been my favorite since childhood.

428
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,310
Taste it.

429
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Earlier today,

430
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,160
I went to the Six Ministries
and other offices.

431
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,790
Thankfully, Lord Wei let me in.

432
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,160
Or I'd be even more embarrassed.

433
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,960
The officials are waiting.

434
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,640
I understand.

435
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,870
Mr. Zheng,

436
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,030
what are you going to do next?

437
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,960
What do you suggest?

438
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,960
There's a well-known tale

439
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,360
in my hometown

440
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,440
called The Tortoise and the Hare.

441
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,200
I'd like to tell you about it.

442
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,350
Go ahead.

443
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,710
The Tortoise and the Hare are racing.

444
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,400
The Hare is faster,

445
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,710
leaving the Tortoise far behind.

446
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,310
The Hare is

447
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,790
proud of its speed,

448
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,070
thinking it'll win for sure

449
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,920
and going to nap halfway.

450
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,920
Meanwhile, the Tortoise

451
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,600
keeps crawling and crawling,

452
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,440
crawling and crawling.

453
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,470
It hasn't stopped at all.

454
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,270
By the time the Hare wakes up,

455
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,510
the Tortoise has reached the finishing line.

456
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,030
As slow as it is,

457
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,600
it'll get there eventually.

458
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,880
Why not consider Lord Wei's advice

459
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,270
to think about those three things?

460
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,310
Take a step back

461
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
and take things slow.

462
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,240
Mr. Xu,

463
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,550
I'm going to tell you a story, too.

464
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,390
Please.

465
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,880
Many years ago, a scholar

466
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,270
became an official at a young age.

467
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,400
He was full of political ambition.

468
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,750
At the age of 30,

469
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,310
he went to Chuzhou.

470
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,880
Everyone thought

471
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,120
he volunteered to serve the people there,

472
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,960
but actually,

473
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,990
he was exiled to that remote barren land

474
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,120
for offending the then Prime Minister.

475
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,750
At first,

476
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,680
he hated that place.

477
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,680
That exiled official

478
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,030
was frustrated.

479
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,600
He was eager to make achievements

480
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,440
to return to the capital someday.

481
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,160
Why didn't he go back to the capital?

482
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,920
In the beginning, he put his career first.

483
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,270
Later,

484
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,880
he saw how poor the locals were,

485
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,550
but he also saw

486
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,680
their kindness

487
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,400
and vitality.

488
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,440
He loved to go to one street.

489
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,750
Originally, he went there
only to eat plain noodles.

490
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,680
Then

491
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,360
he found the coarse buns
sold in the shop on the street corner

492
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,270
also flavorful.

493
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,440
He saw the widow on the west side

494
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,640
marry another man

495
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,640
and a boy with snot
playing games on the street corner

496
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,200
grow up

497
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,960
and help his father run the lamb stall.

498
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,200
In 20 years' time,

499
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,710
he got to know many people there

500
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
and walked down every street.

501
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,030
That city wasn't as beautiful as Jiangnan

502
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,400
or as bustling as the capital,

503
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,710
but as time passed,

504
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,640
it became his hometown.

505
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,840
He decided

506
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
to stay.

507
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,230
Is the scholar in that story

508
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,120
you, sir?

509
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,200
I'm over 50 years old.

510
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,440
I should know the mandate of heaven.

511
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,440
I became unambitious a long time ago.

512
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,880
I just wanted to look after my mother,

513
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,270
children, and grandchildren

514
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,880
while keeping Chuzhou safe.

515
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,920
But the city was destroyed

516
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,710
overnight.

517
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,360
All those people

518
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,680
ended up dead.

519
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,030
I wanted to live a carefree life.

520
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,990
I wanted to take things slow.

521
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,600
But the deceased

522
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,790
came to haunt me every single night.

523
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,120
I couldn't live

524
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,270
or die.

525
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,440
I couldn't give in

526
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,200
or give up.

527
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,360
Bones piled up.

528
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,470
I saw them all the time.

529
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,070
Their wail was echoing.

530
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,750
Lord Wei said to take things slow.

531
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,360
He might be right,

532
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,840
but I...

533
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,790
cannot stop.

534
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,790
Sir, would you like some water lanterns?

535
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,550
Float them with your wishes

536
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,400
to pray for heaven's blessing

537
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,840
and your wishes to come true.

538
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,510
I'd like one.

539
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,520
Here you go.

540
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,440
Thank you, sir!

541
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,680
Mr. Zheng,

542
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,470
may your wishes come true.

543
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,750
I hope so.

544
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,990
What's going on in the Cabinet lately?

545
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,270
Your Majesty,

546
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,750
Prime Minister Wang didn't see anyone.

547
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,920
What about Wei Yuan?

548
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,310
Two days ago, after the court meeting,

549
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,840
Commissioner Zheng
went to the Guardian Yamen.

550
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,030
Lord Wei received him.

551
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,070
Since then,

552
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,400
they haven't crossed paths again.

553
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,470
Both of them are smart.

554
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,550
Rejecting Zheng Xinghuai

555
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,160
is to give him a way out.

556
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,470
But

557
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,030
Wei Yuan

558
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,880
respects me even less.

559
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,400
What did Zheng Xinghuai do?

560
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,920
Your Majesty,

561
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,750
he didn't take Lord Wei's advice.

562
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,400
He's been running around

563
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,200
to incite the high-ups

564
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,510
and persuade the officials.

565
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,360
But they won't see him.

566
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,640
They know

567
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,640
what you're thinking.

568
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,640
He's digging his own grave.

569
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,160
Who are you?

570
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
Step back.

571
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I am

572
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,470
the Commander of Chuzhou,

573
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,790
State Duke of Protection, Que Yongxiu!

574
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
I'm here to sue

575
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,600
the Commissioner of Chuzhou,
Zheng Xinghuai!

576
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,750
He murdered Duke Zhenbei!

577
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,310
He killed 380,000 people of Chuzhou!

578
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,550
He

579
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,270
deceived the mission

580
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,990
and hunted me

581
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,030
in order to cover up the truth

582
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,990
that he colluded with Kui

583
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,270
to frame Duke Zhenbei,

584
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,510
accusing him of killing those people!

585
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,920
He is unforgivable!

586
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,470
Your Majesty,

587
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,790
Zheng Xinghuai sided with the mission

588
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,200
to go after me.

589
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,160
He framed the bloodshed
against Duke Zhenbei

590
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,400
to cover for his collusion with Kui.

591
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,120
He is unforgivable!

592
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,640
Your Majesty, please uphold justice for me,

593
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,310
for Duke Zhenbei,

594
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,200
and for the people of Chuzhou!

595
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,510
Your Majesty!

596
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,440
380,000 people

597
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,880
died tragically.

598
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,440
Duke Zhenbei!

599
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,160
How dare he lie to me.

600
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,880
Those poor souls

601
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,230
of 380,000 people.

602
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,790
And my poor brother!

603
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,470
Let all of them read it.

604
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,310
Yes.

605
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,640
He fooled me.

606
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,480
What...!

607
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,230
What a tragedy!

608
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,990
Take a look.

609
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,090
Look, everyone!

610
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,710
Please, Your Majesty!

611
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,550
Your Majesty,

612
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,640
Zheng Xinghuai colluded with Kui,

613
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,510
killed Duke Zhenbei,

614
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,070
and twisted the facts
to deceive Your Majesty.

615
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,630
He is unforgivable!

616
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,440
His entire clan shall be executed!

617
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,880
I tried to stop Zheng Xinghuai,

618
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,630
but he was too stubborn.

619
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,240
Weren't he stubborn,

620
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,030
he wouldn't have been exiled
by my predecessor.

621
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,760
It's too soon to act.

622
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,240
Why couldn't he wait a bit longer?

623
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,840
I had men look for Que Yongxiu in secret

624
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,840
but didn't find him.

625
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,400
Now that he's in the Palace,

626
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,990
there's no more wiggle room.

627
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,630
Not exactly.

628
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,800
The officials obeyed His Majesty's thought

629
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
because Duke Zhenbei had died.

630
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,880
Dead men tell no tales.

631
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,840
Now that Que Yongxiu is back alive,

632
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,920
things can take a favorable turn.

633
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I've had people check out Que Yongxiu.

634
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,280
If he's found guilty,

635
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,760
we can convict Duke Zhenbei.

636
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,280
This is our chance.

637
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,320
Que Yongxiu's return

638
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,150
did give someone hope to reverse the case.

639
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,920
During the meeting earlier,

640
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,150
His Majesty made us leave

641
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,240
to have State Duke Cao and others

642
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,280
conclude this case.

643
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,720
Your Majesty,

644
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,960
a thorough investigation is needed.

645
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,160
This case

646
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,840
is huge.

647
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,190
It must be thoroughly investigated.

648
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,680
Have

649
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,720
the Court of Judicial Review investigate it.

650
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,760
State Duke Cao,

651
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,990
you're the Lead Investigator.

652
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,920
Yes.

653
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,550
Take the Gold Badge.

654
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,670
Go to the inn to arrest Zheng Xinghuai now.

655
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,800
Kill him if he resists!

656
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,070
You're wise, Your Majesty!

657
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:23,880
Thank you, Your Majesty!

658
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,800
Your Majesty,

659
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,670
your health is most important.

660
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,510
Go...

661
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,510
Go fetch me

662
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,440
- a Golden Pill.
- Yes.

663
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,670
Take care of yourself, Your Majesty.

664
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,350
Eunuch Yang.

665
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,510
Lord Wei,

666
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,440
Prime Minister Wang.

667
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,920
What's the situation

668
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,510
in the Imperial Study?

669
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,240
The meeting just ended.

670
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,550
His Majesty is a bit tired

671
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,030
and taking a nap.

672
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,110
He won't see anyone else today.

673
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,880
He's made his decision

674
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,360
and had men go to the inn

675
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,840
to arrest Commissioner Zheng.

676
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,960
You fell sick from grief.

677
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,150
It's nothing too severe, though.

678
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,030
Take some herbs

679
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,360
and rest, then you'll be fine.

680
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,150
Are you with the Bureau?

681
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,320
I heard Physicians there are highly skilled.

682
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,630
The formidable Supervisor can tell fortune.

683
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,320
I know what you're thinking

684
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,990
and why Xu Qi'an asked me

685
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,280
to treat you.

686
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,960
However,

687
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,920
if you wish to see my master,

688
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,590
just give up.

689
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,960
The Bureau never interferes in state affairs.

690
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,880
That's the rule.

691
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,950
Who are you?

692
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,320
How dare you break in!

693
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,720
Sir, I'll go and check.

694
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,240
I'll go.

695
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,510
Stay put, Mister.

696
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,590
I'll go.

697
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,670
Xu Qi'an doesn't want you to get hurt.

698
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,280
Thank you, Miss.

699
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,990
But I need to face

700
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,760
what comes my way.

701
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,590
I have to trouble you

702
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,470
to pass this to Silver Gong Xu.

703
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,630
We're ordered by His Majesty

704
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,280
to take Zheng Xinghuai
to Judicial Review for questioning!

705
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,150
What is Mr. Zheng guilty of?

706
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,510
The Commander of Chuzhou,
Duke Que Yongxiu returned.

707
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,240
He told His Majesty

708
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,280
about what really happened in Chuzhou.

709
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,630
The truth is

710
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,550
Commissioner Zheng Xinghuai

711
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,110
colluded with Kui,

712
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,990
causing the deaths
of Duke Zhenbei and 380,000 people!

713
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,670
No! None of that is true!

714
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,760
No one can take Mr. Zheng away!

715
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,070
So weak and ignorant.

716
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,840
Don't overreach yourself.

717
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,510
Seize them!

718
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,300
Silver Gong Li Yuchun!

719
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,320
Copper Gong Song Tingfeng!

720
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Copper Gong Zhu Guangxiao!

721
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,030
We'll protect Mr. Zheng to the death!

722
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,990
Copper Gongs?

723
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,840
Are 7th-Rank Fighters trying to stop me?

724
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,840
Plus a lowly Silver Gong, huh?

725
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Go!

726
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,510
What about Gold Gongs?

727
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,190
Gold Gong Peng Yuan!

728
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,760
Gold Gong Fang Wuyan!

729
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,840
Gold Gong Sima Qing!

730
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,470
Gold Gong Wu Lei!

731
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,070
Gold Gong Yan Ming!

732
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,510
Gold Gong Huo Juncheng!

733
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,630
Gold Gong Jiang Lyuzhong!

734
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,400
Gold Gong Nangong Qianrou!

735
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,760
Gold Gong

736
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,960
Yang Yan!

737
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,360
All of you are the pillars of the court

738
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,510
with a limitless future.

739
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,670
Before you defy His Majesty's order,

740
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,190
think about

741
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,960
the consequences

742
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,590
of challenging the court.

743
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,840
If you take one step forward,

744
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,920
you'll know

745
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,360
the consequences!

746
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,190
The Guardians

747
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,880
