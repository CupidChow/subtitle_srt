00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,080
State Duke Cao and Que Yongxiu were killed.

190
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,230
Who did that?

191
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,740
(Silver Gong, Xu Qi'an)

192
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,540
(Silver Gong)

193
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,060
(Six Months Later)

194
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,950
That's all

195
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,280
about Duke Zhenbei's Bloodshed Case.

196
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,750
What was that mysterious light?

197
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,680
What caused the fall of anomalies?

198
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,200
Was that really heaven's wrath?

199
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,160
No one knows

200
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,680
the answer.

201
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,830
(Eradication)
But after that,

202
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
the Chuzhou Case

203
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,830
took a sharp turn.

204
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,200
Take everything away.

205
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,440
Following the anomalies,

206
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,160
the truth was made public.

207
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,560
His Majesty had covered it up

208
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,920
to maintain the imperial image.

209
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,310
Why did he uncover the truth all of a sudden?

210
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,450
That was all

211
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,040
thanks to

212
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,880
the Guardians.

213
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,100
(Censorate, Censor He)

214
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,200
Don't mistake it.

215
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,680
Tomorrow in court,

216
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,710
do what you have to do

217
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,200
with a clear conscience.

218
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,060
(Remonstration)

219
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,260
(Duke Que and Duke Cao
killed Commissioner Zheng Xinghuai.)

220
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,510
Wei Yuan,

221
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,930
how audacious of you.

222
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,310
You've come this far because of me.

223
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,990
Do you think you can challenge me now?

224
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,160
And you.

225
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,230
You two

226
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,200
battled for decades.

227
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Now, you're ganging up against me.

228
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Good for you.

229
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,400
What else can you do? Let's see it.

230
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,680
I'll sentence you

231
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,990
to death for deception and disobedience.

232
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,200
Who else is on their side?

233
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,470
Step forward

234
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,120
and let me see.

235
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,790
There they are.

236
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,840
You too?

237
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,680
Are you revolting against me?

238
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm the Emperor of the Dafeng,

239
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,880
the ruler of the state.

240
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,120
I can't be wrong!

241
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,940
All of you are educated.

242
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,060
Don't you know

243
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
this is an act of rebellion?

244
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,700
Rebels!

245
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,460
All of you!

246
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,180
I'll kill all the rebels!

247
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,260
All of you!

248
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,860
- Guards...
- Your Majesty!

249
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,180
The Second Sage's Knife!

250
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,020
I'm holding

251
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,660
the sacred treasure of the Yunlu Academy

252
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,580
to remonstrate with you!

253
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,980
Gentlemen should be honest.

254
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,220
So should the Emperor!

255
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,780
Your Majesty,

256
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,380
issue

257
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,860
an Edict of Introspection!

258
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,300
Your Majesty,

259
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,220
issue an Edict of Introspection!

260
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,060
I've done nothing wrong.

261
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,820
Ever.

262
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,540
No one knew

263
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,500
the secret chamber of the Haoqi Tower

264
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,920
kept proof of officials' guilt
and dirt on them.

265
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,540
Amazing!

266
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,500
The Guardians are unbelievably capable.

267
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,780
Agreed.

268
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,300
Lord Wei's tactical mind is unmatched.

269
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,500
Well,

270
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,300
Lord Wei's strategy succeeded.

271
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,300
The long-standing issues

272
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,740
and those greedy officials in court

273
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,140
shook the state.

274
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,660
Then what happened?

275
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,860
After this incident,

276
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,540
the state turned unstable.

277
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,020
The Witcher's Sect was aggressive,

278
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,860
provoking us constantly.

279
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,300
Lord Wei volunteered
to guard the northern border.

280
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
Three months later,

281
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,220
in a battle against The Witcher's Sect,

282
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,420
he was killed.

283
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,660
He died a worthy death.

284
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,900
Our war hero was

285
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,260
eventually brought back home.

286
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,780
Lord Wei's death was

287
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,020
a heavy blow to Prime Minister Wang.

288
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,580
In a few days' time,

289
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,500
his hair turned white.

290
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,340
Luckily, Mr. Xu was there.

291
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,480
Who's Mr. Xu?

292
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,960
Yes.

293
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,220
After Lord Wei passed away,

294
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,300
perhaps only Mr. Xu
could hold the state

295
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,260
and share Prime Minister Wang's burden.

296
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,200
His future would be promising.

297
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,380
The sky would be the limit.

298
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,460
(Past and Present)
He's great.

299
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
Mr. Xu's capable.

300
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,900
Father, Mother,

301
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,220
he's back. He's back.

302
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,140
Father,

303
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,300
Mother, I'm home.

304
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,300
Welcome home.

305
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,340
You're back, son!

306
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,740
Why did you come back early?

307
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,980
The proof of corruption
of the Commissioner of Wanzhou was solid.

308
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,500
It was much easier to convict him
than I thought.

309
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,970
You won't leave again, will you?

310
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,810
Right.

311
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,740
On the way back,

312
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,300
I received the transfer order.

313
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,100
Floods suddenly struck Jianzhou

314
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
and submerged the fields,

315
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,900
making the locals homeless.

316
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,300
The Crown Prince assigned me
to control the floods

317
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,580
and help the people.

318
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,860
I'll set out tomorrow.

319
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,270
Tomorrow...?

320
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,380
As a new official,

321
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,340
you've gained the Crown Prince's trust.

322
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,140
But the situation in court remains unclear.

323
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,660
I wonder if that's good.

324
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,260
Of course it is.

325
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,500
Serving the people is

326
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,560
a gentleman's duty.

327
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,620
It's a great deed.

328
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,020
Lingyue is right.

329
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,060
When the state is unstable

330
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,260
in chaos,

331
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,860
as a scholar

332
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,340
and a chosen one,

333
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,460
I'm obligated to support the Dafeng.

334
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,380
I know, I know.

335
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,740
"If fate hadn't let Xu Xinnian be born,

336
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,090
the Dafeng would still be in the dark."

337
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,640
Alright. Enough.

338
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,540
You'll leave tomorrow.

339
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,900
Go to your room to rest.

340
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,800
I'll call you when the meal is ready.

341
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,420
Wait, where's Lingyin?

342
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,190
I brought her green bean cakes from Wanzhou.

343
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,860
She's like a big green bean cake.

344
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,420
- Lingyin!
- Lingyin!

345
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,820
Green bean cakes!

346
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,660
Where were you?

347
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,850
Green bean cakes for you.

348
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,340
Green bean cakes!

349
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,940
Who gave you

350
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,740
the candied hawthorns?

351
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Did you buy them for her?

352
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,660
I was in the kitchen all day.

353
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,340
How could I buy them for her?

354
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,380
You have all my money.

355
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,380
I couldn't buy them even if I wanted to.

356
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,780
Who bought them for you?

357
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,700
Who was it?

358
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,460
Did you buy them for her?

359
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,500
No.

360
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,420
She held my leg and kept begging me.

361
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,240
So you paid for them?

362
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,550
You're rich.

363
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,940
Stop. Or you'll lose all your teeth.

364
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,540
I don't need teeth.

365
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,500
I don't need them.

366
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,580
I don't need teeth.

367
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,700
I can eat a lot without them.

368
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,900
I apologize for her.

369
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,460
My sister's spoiled.

370
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
Please don't mind her.

371
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,740
Son,

372
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,500
do you know him?

373
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,820
No.

374
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,220
No?

375
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,860
Why didn't he take the money?

376
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,980
What a strange man.

377
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Stop eating!

378
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,980
Don't eat anything from strangers.

379
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,980
- Or you might be taken away!
- No.

380
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,500
Are you deaf? Can you hear me?

381
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,450
- Let's go.
- Can you?

382
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,900
- Let's eat.
- You only like eating.

383
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,740
Come on.

384
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,980
Senior Song,

385
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,340
this is the 48th time.

386
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,740
Are you sure plums

387
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,580
can grow as big as peaches?

388
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,220
This time

389
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,420
is the charm.

390
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,660
Hey,

391
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,740
why not

392
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,220
graft rabbit heads on cows?

393
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,460
That way, I can eat

394
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,580
spicy rabbit heads the size of cow heads.

395
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,780
Caiwei,

396
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,740
don't always

397
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,180
think about food.

398
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,420
Besides,

399
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,460
the combination of animals isn't a graft

400
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,700
but hybridization.

401
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,780
And don't forget reproductive isolation.

402
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,600
Reproductive isolation?

403
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,020
Reproductive isolation

404
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,900
means different species

405
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,340
can't...

406
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,700
Can't what?

407
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,180
Right.

408
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,740
What is it?

409
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,900
What's reproductive isolation?

410
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,180
What's reproduction?

411
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,220
What's isolation?

412
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,500
Senior Song,

413
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,750
you have a visitor outside.

414
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,780
Outside... reproduction...

415
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,580
Outside... isolation...

416
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,580
I was paid one liang of silver

417
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,300
to deliver this book and the cart

418
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,620
to you.

419
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,620
Senior Song.

420
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:13,140
(The Codex of Alchemy)

421
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,060
(Equivalent exchange is
the unchanging...)

422
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,100
"Equivalent exchange

423
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,260
is the unchanging principle of alchemy."

424
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,740
Equivalent exchange.

425
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,620
That's right.

426
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,980
Master once said

427
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
the essence of alchemy

428
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,060
isn't change

429
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
but transformation.

430
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Transformation...

431
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,740
"Why can weapons work?

432
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
Because of energy.

433
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,220
Why do lives exist?

434
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,540
Because of energy."

435
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,780
Is life also a kind of energy?

436
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,420
Is that so, Senior Song?

437
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,540
Don't interrupt.

438
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,900
"The essence of alchemy is
an equivalent exchange.

439
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,180
Humans and weapons need energy.

440
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,260
They can transform or merge.

441
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,220
If done properly, souls can be rebuilt

442
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,380
to achieve rebirth!"

443
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,020
How is that possible?

444
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,180
What a bunch of nonsense.

445
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,460
Whoever wrote this book

446
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,860
should be executed!

447
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,000
Ask that man

448
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,380
who gave him this book.

449
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,660
Sure.

450
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,740
Who gave you this book?

451
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,060
Why do I find it so shocking

452
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,900
yet familiar?

453
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:14,340
3, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.

454
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,260
Who taught me these moves?

455
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,140
8 Circles.

456
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,180
- I won.
- Enjoy.

457
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,420
It's as you said.

458
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,240
No sugar.

459
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,450
I put soy sauce, chopped green onion,
and minced garlic.

460
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,580
Leave me alone!

461
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,460
Go away!

462
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,780
Wei Yuan is dead.

463
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,140
You Guardians...

464
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,540
How dare you kick me!

465
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,300
Do you know who my father is?

466
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,740
I don't care.

467
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,300
Abducting a woman

468
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,460
is against the law.

469
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,740
You insulted the Guardians.

470
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,820
That makes you more guilty.

471
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,020
Take him away!

472
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,260
Get up.

473
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,510
Let's continue.

474
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,470
No, I quit.

475
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,540
- No more money.
- Let go!

476
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,020
Let me go!

477
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,620
Hands off!

478
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,500
What's up, Guangxiao?

479
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,340
Nothing.

480
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,140
This place seems so familiar.

481
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,220
Did we play mahjong here?

482
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,300
We're going to Jianzhou.

483
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,620
I hope we can work together.

484
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,460
I need your help.

485
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,220
That's right.

486
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,820
You two, put aside your prejudice

487
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,860
for the greater good.

488
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,100
Fine.

489
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,140
I'll do it for you.

490
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,820
Don't worry.

491
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,020
I've got a new case

492
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,060
to cultivate sword energy.

493
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,460
We'll return

494
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,820
in triumph.

495
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,660
Your case is trash.

496
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,500
Get rid of it.

497
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,370
(Ten years it takes to grind a sword.
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested.)

498
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:26,380
(I'm showing it today.
Who's been done injustice?)

499
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,380
Miss, it tastes good.

500
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,260
Cheer up. You've only read files
for a few days.

501
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,370
Pull yourselves together.

502
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,380
Chief,

503
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,580
we haven't gone home for five days.

504
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,020
Alright. I know.

505
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,190
Let's go have fun in the brothel.

506
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,860
Constable Wang is so hot!

507
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,500
- Thanks.
- So hot!

508
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,340
I'm flattered.

509
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,940
So hot!

510
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,860
Your Highness,

511
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,140
why do you suddenly
want to go to the Lake Villa?

512
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,900
I don't know either.

513
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,860
I just want to go back there.

514
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,300
Besides,

515
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,300
maybe I can draw inspiration from it.

516
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,500
Come to think of it,

517
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,580
whenever you go back there,

518
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,780
you're inspired to write poems,

519
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,980
and they're wonderful.

520
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,020
However,

521
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,260
I have to remind you

522
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,980
that every time you leave there,

523
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,980
you'll always feel unwell

524
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,060
with no appetite.

525
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,820
It's not that bad.

526
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,540
I also don't know why...

527
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,660
Princess has arrived!

528
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,820
Who is this?

529
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,740
Who is this?

530
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,660
How dare you stare at her!

531
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,620
Bow!

532
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
Your Highness, I'm sorry

533
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,060
for getting in your way.

534
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,420
(Lake Villa)

535
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Didn't I say

536
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,140
that even if I seldom came,

537
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,860
this place had to be kept clean?

538
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,140
Yes.

539
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,700
Sorry for my negligence.

540
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,140
Why bother? You didn't come here.

541
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,980
What a beautiful line.

542
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,580
Agreed. So is this line.

543
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,420
The word "rustling" is brilliant,

544
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,140
bringing out the sound of the eastern wind.

545
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,400
This one is better.

546
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,260
"Thunder faintly rolled
beyond the lotus pool."

547
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,740
- Go and check.
- This line...

548
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,940
This is well-written, too.

549
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,180
But this one is the best.

550
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,860
No, I beg to differ.

551
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,380
A young man sent this book

552
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,300
to you, Your Majesty.

553

"Love not your golden dress, I pray.

554
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,580
More than your youthful golden hours."

555
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,460
What a masterpiece.

556
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,540
"Through the window,
she sees dusk of the day.

557
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,500
In the gilded room,
she wipes her tears away."

558
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,780
"Pearls in the moonlit sea
bore tears of a maid.

♪The sky is clear now; the clouds are gone♪

562
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,900
I like this line.

♪No more cold starts at night♪

564
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,020
Finished.

Here you go.

(Pearls in the moonlit sea

Where's the rest?

568
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,660
What is it?

569
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,420
The rest will be done

570
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,500
in the rest of this year.

571
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,000
You tricked me!

572
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,320
You want to bargain with me again.

573
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,900
No, if I gave you the full piece,

574
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,220
how could I be with you all the time?

575
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,580
That's shameful.

576
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,300

577
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,660
Ow! It hurts!

578
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,900
Give me a few days.

579
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,020
I'll make it up to you.

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,420
I'll give you a book of poems!

00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,620
Don't just eat fish.

646
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,340
your fish is too salty.

647
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,540
No, it's not.

648
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540

653
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,020
have a drumstick.

00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,980
- Let's eat.
- Eat up.

00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,820
Eat, everyone.

657
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,380

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,260

659
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,800

Come on.

679
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,020
Mr. Xu,

680
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,580
it's time to set out.

681
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,740
Come on.

682
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,400

685
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,380
Mr. Xu is here.

686
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,660
I know

687
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,220
it's bitter to be forgotten by others.

688
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,620
Isn't that all because of you?

689
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,780
I've

690
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,500
brought that man back.

691
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,160
It's an equivalent exchange.

692
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,060
How will you pay me back?

693
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,580
With fortune inside, one won't live forever.

694
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,220
Once it's drawn out, one will die.

695
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,260
If you want

696
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,380
the fortune inside me,

697
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,300
draw it out anytime.

698
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,220
I'm not the one

699
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,700
coveting the fortune in you

700
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
from the beginning.

701
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,300
Do you know

702
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,260
why Supervisor gave you
the Black Gold Saber

703
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
and manuals of skills,

704
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,460
and why he shielded you all the time?

705
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,980
He means

706
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,220
to use the Dafeng's fortune
to reach higher ranks,

707
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,660
while you

708
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,380
own the fortune,

709
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,460
and you've become

710
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,180
a Fighter.

711
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,060
You're perfect to assist him

712
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,380
with his cultivation.

713
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,430
Once he no longer needs you,

714
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,780
a pawn like you

715
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,260
will be abandoned.

716
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,580
Then

717
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,180
he'll draw out

718
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,780
the fortune.

719
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,780
Without it,

720
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,340
you'll

721
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,300
end up dead.

722
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,540
Do you mean you're saving my life?

723
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,820
Don't you find that absurd?

724
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,660
We made painstaking efforts

725
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,940
to find the only way to success.

726
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,660
Only by casting the mystifying spell

727
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,580
can we have Supervisor shielded.

728
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,780
That way,

729
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,100
you'll be able to get rid of him

730
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,460
and regain freedom.

731
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,270
I'm

732
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,440
the only one you can trust.

733
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,210
Who exactly are you?

734
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,340
In life,

735
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,260
the simplest is the best.

736
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,860
I hoped you'd enjoy three meals a day

737
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,460
in peace.

738
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,980
That's why

739
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,430
I named you Ningyan,

740
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,270

Part One ends.

783
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,580
That's it?

784
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,100
How about

785
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,020
we play around round?

786
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,320
- Sure.
- OK.

787
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,170
One more round.

788
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,340
No, thanks.

789
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,220
Maybe next time.

790
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,700
Too bad, Lord Wei died.

791
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,820
Yeah.

792
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,780
It was like they skipped The Witcher's Sect.

793
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,340
That's the plot in Part Two.

794
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,080
It also includes the things in Yunzhou.

795
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,380
Great!

796
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,540
Let's play that one next time.

797
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,020
Sure. Yeah.

798
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,360
Let's go.

799
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,780

I'm showing it today.)

Yang Ling!

804
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,140
What does

805
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,880
the last sentence
that man in black said mean?

806
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,280
Do you know that?

807
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,500
No.

808
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,660
About that,

809
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,020
I'll tell you

810
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,460
next time.

811
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,580
