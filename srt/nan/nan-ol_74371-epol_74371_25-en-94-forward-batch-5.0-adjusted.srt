00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,560
[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

4
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,110
Your Highness looks downcast.

5
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,530
Is there something bothering you?

6
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,520
Mr. Qin, you know my true desires.

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,009
But as the Crown Prince,

8
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,030
there are things I must give up...

9
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,200
and others I must fight for.

10
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,530
Is it because

11
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,880
His Majesty blamed you

12
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,110
for the Crown Prince of Beidai's
recent peril?

13
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,590
Fortunately, Lady Wan saved him

14
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,100
and helped Yan Chi capture
the true culprit.

15
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,510
My failure to protect him

16
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,330
has been offset by this merit.

17
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,490
However, Mother

18
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,110
fears that Lady Wan might be used
by someone with ulterior motives,

19
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,240
so she wants you to

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,100
recommend her

21
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,280
as a candidate to be my consort.

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,340
But Wan

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,860
has already been granted
the title of Princess Yongci.

24
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,190
How could she be made a secondary consort?

25
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,360
Could it be

26
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,670
that the Empress wants her to
be the primary consort?

27
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,810
Then what would become

28
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,140
of my daughter, Zhaoyu?

29
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,170
So in your view, Royal Guardian,

30
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,450
my primary consort can only be

31
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,079
Lady Yu?

32
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,800
Your Highness, please forgive me.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,260
I never meant such a thing.

34
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,180
How could I not know

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,930
of your love for your daughter?

36
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,710
My mother is also

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,920
very fond of her.

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,710
It's only

39
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,990
because Lady Wan is from the same clan
as your family

40
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,240
that the difference in rank

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,100
wouldn't create family discordâ€”

42
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,800
that's why Mother brought this up.

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,960
To be honest,

44
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,060
I have also considered

45
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,240
having Wan

46
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,680
marry alongside Yu as a secondary wife

47
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,760
and become

48
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,670
a great support for Your Highness.

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,829
But now...

50
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,060
This is merely my mother's idea.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,240
In the end, we still need
my father's approval

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,150
to make it so.

53
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,040
Rest assured, Royal Guardian.

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,130
If Zhaoyu

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,360
is unwilling to suffer this indignity,

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,690
I will also ask my mother

57
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,079
to arrange

58
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,960
a good marriage for her...

59
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,320
ensuring her lifelong happiness.

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,540
Thank you, Your Highness,

61
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,070
for your thoughtfulness
toward my daughter.

62
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,850
Your Highness.

63
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,950
This way, Your Highness.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Quickly call for an imperial physician!

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,790
Wait.

66
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,150
Mother,

67
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,680
there's no need to trouble an  physician
for such a minor injury.

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,790
If word reaches the palace,

69
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,030
people might misunderstand and think

70
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,350
that I'm displeased about Qin Wan
being granted the title of princess.

71
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,000
Moyi,

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,790
just fetch some medicine for the wound.

73
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,520
Yes, My Lady.

74
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,960
Does it hurt?

75
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,140
You've never suffered

76
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,510
like this since childhood.

77
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,800
It's all because of Qin Wan.

78
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,440
If she weren't always competing
and trying to outdo others,

79
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,560
how could you end up so wronged?

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,340
Mother, don't worry.

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,120
After venting my feelings,

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
I feel much relieved.

83
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,580
Qin Wan earned her title
through genuine merit

84
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,320
and has been of great help
to the Crown Prince.

85
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,030
The Empress favors her out of necessity.

86
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:44,909
I am

87
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,550
not feeling wronged.

88
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,640
If you're not feeling wronged,

89
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,810
why would you hurt yourself like this?

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,790
Mother.

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,300
What bothers me

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
isn't Qin Wan,

93
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,590
but the Crown Prince.

94
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,660
How could he so casually speak of

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
arranging another marriage for me?

96
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,680
Silly girl,

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,330
men are the least reliable creatures.

98
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,710
Even if they cherish you deeply now,

99
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,710
after a few years, the passion will fade.

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,120
Moreover,

101
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,120
if the Crown Prince ascends to the throne,

102
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,700
how could you be the only one
in his harem?

103
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,080
You must remember

104
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,830
to protect your own heart.

105
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,460
I understand, Mother.

106
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,050
But it's easier said than done.

107
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,390
Xiang?

108
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,830
What are you doing...

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,200
These two wretched girls.

110
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,710
How dare they eavesdrop!

111
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,840
We absolutely can't let them spread
what they've heard.

112
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,760
Xiang, why are you pulling me along
like this?

113
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,350
Did Aunt see us just now?

114
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,150
Aunt?

115
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,760
You were eavesdropping...

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Keep your voice down.

117
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,920
Have you lost your mind?

118
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,640
You've already been grounded once.

119
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,050
If Aunt finds out
that you were eavesdropping on her,

120
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,790
do you think you'll have any peace?

121
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,400
How are our days good now?

122
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,270
We're all ladies of the Qin family,

123
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,410
yet the two youngest ones have risen
above us.

124
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,920
One is set to become Crown Princess,

125
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,270
while the other has been bestowed
the title of princess

126
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,640
and is about to enjoy the high life.

127
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Who has ever cared about our future?

128
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
I only wish to marry into a decent,
honest family.

129
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,680
Aunt will find good matches for us.

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
What good match
could she possibly arrange for us?

131
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,830
Are you really content

132
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,680
to curtsy and kneel to our younger sisters
for the rest of your life?

133
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,010
What's there to resent?

134
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
If I must kneel, then I kneel.

135
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,320
Besides, I'm the daughter of a concubine.

136
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
I was never your equal to begin with.

137
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,280
But

138
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,350
I resent it.

139
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,440
Stop them.

140
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,350
Xiang.

141
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,409
I am the Fifth Lady, born of
the principal wife of the third branch.

142
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:03,340
What do you want?

143
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
The Madam says

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,470
there's too much pollen
and too many insects in spring

145
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,680
and requests that both of you

146
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,970
return to your quarters
and remain there for a while.

147
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,580
She wants to ground me again?

148
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,410
By what right?

149
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you referring to me
when you say "she"?

150
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,880
Slap her!

151
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,210
Please calm down, Aunt!

152
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,640
Xiang spoke disrespectfully.

153
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,990
Please don't be mad.

154
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,550
Xiang,

155
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,820
apologize now.

156
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,060
I was wrong.

157
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Please, Aunt, forgive me this once.

158
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,950
I can forgive you,

159
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,150
but have you thought about thisâ€”

160
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,230
if word spreads in the capital
about your disrespect toward your elders

161
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,980
and your improper behavior,

162
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,470
even if I forgive you,

163
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,520
you will never

164
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,100
marry into a good family.

165
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,590
Aunt, I know I was wrong.

166
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,020
Good that you know.

167
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,320
From now on, don't listen to
what you shouldn't hear,

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,050
and especially don't say
what you shouldn't say.

169
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,550
Otherwise,

170
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,360
don't blame me for sending you to
a family temple for penance.

171
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,460
Please rest assured, Aunt.

172
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,230
I will never dare to do that again.

173
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,080
Good girl.

174
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,190
Escort the two young ladies back.

175
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,850
Yes, Madam.

176
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,280
Have those four maids

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,320
take turns guarding their quarters' doors
in two shifts.

178
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,520
Not even a scrap of paper should get out.

179
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,360
We cannot let that wretched girl
cause any more trouble.

180
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,560
Understood.

181
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,280
I'll see to it at once, Madam.

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm not drunk.

183
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,630
Go where?

184
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,510
Isn't this my home?

185
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,820
Go home?

186
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,830
I'm the heir to Prince Yi!

187
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,590
Do any of you take me seriously?

188
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,430
Who should I talk to when I go back?

189
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,210
To myself?

190
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,230
Or to you?

191
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,350
I...

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,660
don't have a home anymore.

193
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Where should I go now?

194
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,360
I don't have a home anymore.

195
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,040
I don't have a home anymore.

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,290
[Funing Palace]

197
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,080
You've finally come to see me.

198
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,260
If it weren't for
your adopted granddaughter saving my life,

199
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,960
you and I

200
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,600
would have been separated by death
long ago.

201
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,050
Sister-in-law,

202
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,560
you're blessed with
good health and longevity.

203
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,680
Surely, you'll live to a hundred.

204
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,090
That's just empty flattery.

205
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,590
At our age,

206
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,410
every day we meet might be the last.

207
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,280
Your Majesty,

208
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,510
Princess Yongci is waiting outside
for your summons.

209
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,870
Wan comes to see me

210
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,560
and still needs to await a summons?

211
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,830
Let her in at once.

212
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,930
Look at these servants,

214
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,990
making everything more and more rigid.

215
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,740
Your Majesty, may you enjoy
boundless fortune and peace.

216
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,860
Grandma, may you have good health
and happiness.

217
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,000
No need for formalities.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,090
Get up, get up.

219
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

220
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,110
Come here, let me take a closer look
at you.

221
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,800
After these days in the capital,

222
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
you've become even more beautiful.

223
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
How is it?

224
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,680
Has Ning

225
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
been good?

226
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,490
Has Chi been protecting you properly?

227
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,670
They've all been very good to me

228
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,870
and haven't neglected me in the slightest.

229
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,040
I can see that your spirit and complexion
are flourishing.

230
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,080
These past days,

231
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,470
I've often asked Ning how you're doing.

232
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,830
She said the family had sent word

233
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,830
that you were safe and sound.

234
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,230
Only then did I feel at ease.

235
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,360
That's because you're so thoughtful.

236
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,830
I knew

237
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,960
all those caring letters
inquiring about me

238
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,890
definitely didn't come from Ning.

239
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,760
Let me tell you, that little monkey,

240
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,300
once she's out of the mansion,

241
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,030
is like a bird

242
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,390
desperate for freedom.

243
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,310
She wouldn't spare a thought...

244
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,080
for her poor old grandmother.

245
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,290
Grandma.

246
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,790
I think of you every day too.

247
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,560
Those caring letters

248
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,340
are from both of us,
showing our filial devotion.

249
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,860
I know, I know.

250
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,380
They're all expressions
of your filial devotion.

251
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,740
Come, sit down.

252
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,310
Greetings, Grand Princess.

253
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

254
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,280
You're all so filial.

255
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,940
Look, here comes
my dose of filial devotion too.

256
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,920
Little Wan'er

257
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,240
has always personally examined
Grandmother's medicine.

258
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,720
From the herbs to the brewing temperature,

259
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,590
she even examines the dregs each time.

260
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,800
She's extremely careful.

261
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,330
That's the way it should be.

262
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,200
With such attentiveness from Wan,

263
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,730
you'll surely recover soon, sister-in-law.

264
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,330
Here, Your Majesty.

265
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,860
I still think brown sugar tastes better.

266
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,560
You instructed Ma'am Chen
not to give me anyâ€”

267
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,690
you're deliberately being mean to me.

268
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,210
Sister-in-law,

269
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,560
please listen to Wan's advice.

270
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,320
Don't act like a child

271
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
throwing a tantrum.

272
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,870
Alright, alright.

273
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,040
When they were young,

274
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,590
we always told them to be good.

275
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,160
Now that we're old,

276
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,630
shouldn't we listen to them
and behave too?

277
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,280
That's right.

278
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,780
Sister-in-law, you've raised
His Majesty well.

279
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,990
His Majesty is truly
the most filial of sons.

280
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,980
He pays his respects to you daily,
rain or shine.

281
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,830
His Majesty is indeed filial,

282
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,830
but

283
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,710
he's busy with state affairs every dayâ€”

284
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,750
truly exhausting.

285
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,280
His Majesty is diligent
and loves his people.

286
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,710
It's a blessing for our country.

287
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,710
Your Highness? Your Highness?

288
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,420
Your Highness.

289
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,420
Sui.

290
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,510
What's wrong?

291
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,280
Your Majesty,

292
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,560
Prince Sui has accidentally spilled ink

293
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,520
on his robe.

294
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,310
It's all right now.

295
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,450
Sui,

296
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,940
how about I take you to get changed, hmm?

297
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,470
Come on.

298
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,800
I'll accompany Sui to change.

299
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,680
Go ahead.

300
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,730
Let's go.

301
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,350
Why hasn't Sui recovered yet?

302
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,350
It's really not easy

303
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,710
for princes and princesses

304
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,640
to grow up safely and peacefully
in the palace.

305
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,870
This little bird belongs to Your Highness?

306
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,320
It doesn't look like one
raised by bird sellers.

307
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,980
The eunuchs caught it for you?

308
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,550
I don't understand.

309
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,280
Someone else caught it for you?

310
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,350
But I still don't get it.

311
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,700
Why doesn't

312
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,320
Your Highness just tell me directly?

313
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,180
I promise not to tell anyone else.

314
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,020
It's okay.

315
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,440
If you don't want to talk, we won't.

316
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,100
I...

317
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,400
I caught it myself.

318
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,710
Then guessâ€”

319
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,260
is this little bird happy

320
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,290
being in a cage?

321
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,630
No.

322
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,350
It's a wild bird.

323
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,870
Now it's separated from its mother

324
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,510
and cut off from the sky,

325
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,800
with no freedomâ€”

326
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,890
of course, it's not happy in there.

327
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,440
It can't speak,

328
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,620
so how do you know it's unhappy?

329
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,320
It can't go anywhere.

330
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,970
How could it be happy?

331
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,020
Why don't we set it free?

332
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,510
Let it return to the sky,

333
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,369
okay?

334
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,010
Okay.

335
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

336
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,680
Sui has always been a good boy,

337
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,080
just not very talkative.

338
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,270
I didn't expect

339
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,870
that you'd actually get him to open up.

340
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,360
Prince Sui is very intelligent.

341
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,220
A little patience is all it takes.

342
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,040
Thank you for your trouble.

343
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,770
I'll go pay my respects
to the Empress Dowager first.

344
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,270
Your Highness,

345
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,020
why don't we go see where that little bird

346
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,770
flew?

347
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,440
Okay.

348
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,960
Okay.

349
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,550
Let's go.

350
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,030
You're finally back.

351
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,230
Her Majesty has just heard from
the Crown Prince

352
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,840
that Sui is willing to speak again.

353
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,250
She was so happy
that she couldn't sit still

354
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,780
and has been asking for you.

355
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,170
Hurry along.

356
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,130
Grand... mother.

357
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,600
You called me "Grandmother."

358
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,710
What a good child.

359
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,420
Sui,

360
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,470
why don't you

361
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,750
go play with Ning for a while?

362
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,210
I'll come find you in a bit.

363
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,200
Let's go.

364
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,310
Be careful.

365
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,380
Let's go.

366
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,570
Has Sui's condition

367
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,440
really improved?

368
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,550
Sui's condition stems from

369
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,200
extreme fright,
leading to psychological obstruction.

370
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,310
Massage and medicine can only provide
temporary relief.

371
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,600
There may be relapses.

372
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,510
Is there really no other way?

373
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,290
Unless the trauma is addressed,

374
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,150
I fear he may never fully recover.

375
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,510
This poor child.

376
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,020
He witnessed his mother

377
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,820
being murdered.

378
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,160
How could he not be traumatized?

379
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,100
Sui has grown close to you,

380
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,880
which shows you have a special connection.

381
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,030
If you're willing,

382
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,640
I'll entrust him to your care.

383
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,710
You must find a way to heal
his emotional wounds.

384
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,640
I'll not fail Your Majesty's trust.

385
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,660
Alright, alright,

386
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,510
Wan has already agreed.

387
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,440
Sister-in-law,

388
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,360
let's sit.

389
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,440
Sit.

390
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,170
Chi is here.

391
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,750
Grandmother, may you enjoy good health.

392
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
Greetings, Great Aunt.

393
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,900
Have you finished discussing
state matters with His Majesty?

394
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,630
Quickly, sit and have some tea.

395
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,440
I cannot stay for long this time.

396
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,070
I...

397
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,550
have come to escort Princess Yongci
out of the palace.

398
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,710
What happened?

399
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
There's been another murder
in the capital.

400
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,280
His Majesty has personally appointed
Princess Yongci

401
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,970
to assist the Ministry of Justice
with the case.

402
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,400
If this case has reached
His Majesty's attention,

403
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,060
it must be a significant case.

404
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,820
Wan...

405
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,470
won't be in any danger, will she?

406
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,710
Please rest assured, Grandmother.

407
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,440
I will protect her with my life.

408
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,930
Protect her?

409
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,960
If you could truly protect her,

410
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,760
how could that incident
with the Princess of Beidai have happened?

411
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,230
That was my fault.

412
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,310
I failed to foresee danger,

413
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,840
which put Wan in harm's way.

414
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,400
It will never happen again.

415
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,160
I don't believe you.

416
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,900
If... if by any chance something happens,

417
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,710
it'll be our Wan who suffers.

418
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,490
Grandma, I won't suffer.

419
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,940
"Won't suffer?"

420
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,030
Alright, alright.

421
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,510
Looks like we two old women
are just worrying too much again.

422
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,470
Alright, you may go.

423
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,440
Yes.

424
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,360
Wait, wait.

425
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,390
Chi,

426
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,360
you're taking Wan with you.

427
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,370
If she so much as has a scratch,

428
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,110
I'll hold you responsible.

429
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,990
You have my word, Grandmother.

430
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,650
Great Aunt, please rest easy.

431
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,100
See? Look at him.

432
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,470
Chi

433
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,510
just takes her away like that.

434
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,880
I was just planning

435
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,070
to find a man for Wanâ€”

436
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,070
at least someone gentle,

437
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,270
who would love her tenderly.

438
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,930
Tell me,

439
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
with Chi's temperament,
can he ever love her tenderly?

440
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,710
Won't she suffer?

441
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,160
Alright, alright.

442
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,300
"The wisest elder knows
when to turn a blind eye."

443
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,310
Since those two

444
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,880
won't speak their hearts to us,

445
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,740
let's just pretend we don't know.

446
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,070
When they get anxious enough,

447
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,930
they'll come to us naturally.

448
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,120
Calm down.

449
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Just listen to me.

450
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,120
Last night, the night watchman

451
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,920
discovered the body right here.

452
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,990
The body was completely naked,

453
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,850
and the death scene was gruesome.

454
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,770
However,

455
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,120
the perpetrator was extremely careful.

456
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,550
Apart from some bloodstains,

457
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,550
there are no other clues whatsoever.

458
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,750
When Mr. Fang conducted
the initial examination,

459
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,550
he found nothing of note either.

460
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,600
Although this alley is
far from the main street,

461
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,920
it connects to many small alleys
and residences.

462
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,160
Whoever did this

463
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,710
must have passed through
at least one of them.

464
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,550
Has anyone seen
any suspicious individuals?

465
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,920
I've already had people investigate,

466
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,470
but apart from
last night's night watchman,

467
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,400
no suspicious persons were found.

468
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,960
Human blood

469
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,220
wouldn't be this dark.

470
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,030
It appears to
be mixed with something else.

471
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,470
But the amount is too small

472
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,600
to tell if it's sand or something else.

473
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,100
With so little blood here,

474
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,310
the actual crime scene

475
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,370
must be elsewhere.

476
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,560
Let's look around the area.

477
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,180
What is this place?

478
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,350
Fengqi House,

479
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,440
a famous brothel in the capital.

480
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,390
That colorful banner is
the brothel's signature sign.

481
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,420
I've never been there.

482
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,550
I just recognized the place
the moment I saw that banner.

483
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,590
There's a tavern behind
and a brothel in front.

484
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,280
After getting drunk,

485
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,060
many unsavory men come to
relieve themselves in this alley.

486
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,720
Let's examine the body first.

487
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,780
Your Highness.

488
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,270
Greetings, Your Highness the Princess.

489
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,330
You should address her as Master Wan.

490
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,510
Wouldn't that be somewhat disrespectful?

491
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,160
Prefect Zheng, no need to worry.

492
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,920
I believe

493
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,920
Master Wan

494
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,050
is not someone who stands on ceremony.

495
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,230
Such a form of address

496
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,650
is simply more convenient for her

497
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,100
when working outside.

498
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,960
Then I shall respectfully comply.

499
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,060
Master Wan.

500
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,450
May I ask how to address you, sir?

501
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,690
This is

502
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,670
Minister Li.

503
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,200
Minister Li,

504
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,710
this is Master Wan.

505
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,790
I didn't get to introduce you properly
back in Yuzhou,

506
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,560
so let this

507
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,520
make up for that.

508
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,310
Minister Li, I've heard of
your accomplishments before,

509
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,790
and now meeting you in person,
I see your reputation is well-deserved.

510
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,860
Though we're meeting for the first time,

511
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,440
you already know
that I prefer informality.

512
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm truly impressed.

513
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,580
Let's save these formalities, Master Wan.

514
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,160
The body is in a horrific condition
with severe decomposition.

515
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,680
Please hurry and take a look.

516
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,990
It's still early spring,

517
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,750
so why is the body so severely decomposed?

518
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,640
Because

519
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,010
the deceased's skin has been
completely peeled off.

520
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,060
Raise the curtains.

521
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,540
When this body was brought in,

522
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,070
I ordered it to be preserved
in an ice cabinet.

523
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,200
But as you can see,

524
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,680
it's still deteriorating rapidly.

525
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,300
The decomposition is indeed severe.

526
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,700
I've never seen
such a cruel method before.

527
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,400
You're right.

528
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,520
The crime scene must be elsewhere.

529
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,920
With such extensive external injuries,

530
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,550
the victim must have lost
a lot of blood before death.

531
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,950
I've never seen anything like this before.

532
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,620
Please enlighten me, Master Wan.

533
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,760
Skin is
the body's greatest protective barrier.

534
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,070
Without this layer of skin,

535
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,400
the underlying flesh is exposed,

536
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,060
which becomes susceptible to
infection and flies,

537
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,430
accelerating decomposition.

538
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,230
That's also why external wounds fester
so easily.

539
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,960
Note this:

540
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,120
second examination of the flaying case.

541
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,060
Victim:

542
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,000
Male corpse with skin peeled off.

543
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,980
You may go.

544
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,030
I'll handle this.

545
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,920
Prefect Zheng, where is Chi?

546
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,480
Note this:

547
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,860
the victim is male.

548
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,510
Height: approximately 1.6 meters.

549
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,580
The jaw has been dislocated,

550
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,840
likely to prevent the victim from
speaking or attempting suicide.

551
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,700
All body skin has been peeled off,

552
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,710
and the wounds have already festered,

553
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,770
rendering the face unrecognizable.

554
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,470
Based on the teeth

555
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,530
and the extent of joint development,

556
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,640
the victim appears to
have just recently come of age.

557
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,310
So young,

558
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,880
yet he met with such misfortune.

559
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,560
Seems like

560
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,840
retribution for frequenting brothels.

561
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,020
Minister Li,

562
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,840
I believe that as a judicial official,

563
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,440
you should understand the importance of
speaking with caution.

564
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,750
No traces of sedative smoke

565
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,480
or other foreign substances
in the mouth or nose.

566
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,340
There's a slight depression
on the back of the head,

567
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,400
apparently caused by a blunt object.

568
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,350
A blow of this impact

569
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,270
would only render someone unconscious,

570
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,270
likely the perpetrator's method

571
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,600
of subduing the victim.

572
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,710
Right.

573
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,720
Note this:

574
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,590
the victim's upper thigh

575
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,450
shows a thin, elongated incision

576
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,880
approximately 2 millimeters deep,

577
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,010
not reaching any major blood vessels.

578
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,440
Judging by the direction of the cuts,

579
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,400
the perpetrator likely used

580
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,880
a thin, sharp knife

581
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
to make the initial incision here

582
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,260
before removing the entire skin.

583
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,230
Approximately every 60 centimeters,

584
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,890
there are
several overlapping shallow wounds.

585
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,160
As if multiple cuts were made

586
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,290
to remove one piece,

587
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,980
likely due to
the perpetrator's wrist fatigue.

588
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,140
This suggests the knife wielder

589
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,140
is likely a physically weak person.

590
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,130
Note this:

591
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,640
the entire body shows
no visible fatal external injuries,

592
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,790
and while there was
significant blood loss, it wasn't lethal.

593
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,310
It's suspected that death was caused
by heart failure

594
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,440
due to excessive pain
during the skin-peeling process.

595
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,410
Master Wan,

596
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,320
are you saying

597
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,710
the victim was still alive

598
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,930
while being skinned?

599
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,400
The wounds on the victim's body

600
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,870
all exhibit signs of contraction.

601
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,000
Only when a person is alive and injured

602
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,820
does the flesh react in this way.

603
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:13,840
Then...

604
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,640
then, the victim was
literally tortured to death?

605
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,100
Could the victim be Yan Li?

606
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,330
Impossible.

607
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:19,960
No,

608
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,690
it's similar to
the lingchi execution in history.

609
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,200
As long as the executioner's technique is
sufficiently skillful,

610
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,160
they could prolong the victim's suffering

611
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,370
without delivering the final fatal blow,

612
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,550
and might even use cardiac stimulants
to keep the victim conscious.

613
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,360
In this case,

614
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,400
whether the victim was given drugs

615
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,730
will only be determined after an autopsy.

616
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,360
But the color of the body's wounds

617
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,120
matches the level of decomposition,

618
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,200
suggesting the skinning process

619
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,360
lasted between 30 minutes and an hour.

620
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
During this period,

621
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,840
continuous skinning

622
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,270
would cause the victim
the most intense suffering.

623
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,550
The perpetrator must have
a secluded location

624
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,120
where they can work undisturbed

625
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,780
to complete the entire crime.

626
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,990
In all my years,

627
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,470
I've never witnessed such cruel methods

628
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,710
until now.

629
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,840
The perpetrator tortured the victim
by flaying him alive.

630
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,310
The method is utterly brutal,

631
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,510
causing extreme suffering to the victim.

632
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,960
Afterward, the perpetrator could still

633
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,020
meticulously clean up the dump site.

634
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,450
This shows he has a cruel nature,
different from ordinary people.

635
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,050
Mr. Fang.

636
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,650
A mercury bead?

637
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,330
Is there any cinnabar on the body?

638
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,680
There should be cinnabar
where the victim was

639
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,140
lying when being skinned.

640
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,970
Bai Feng!

641
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,730
Yes, Master!

642
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,350
Constable Zhan, please go invite

643
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,360
an artist to draw the victim's portrait

644
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,020
to help with identification.

645
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,540
But...

646
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,690
how could anyone portray
someone without skin?

647
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,470
A skilled artist can reconstruct a face

648
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,120
by analyzing the bone structure

649
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,550
and facial contours.

650
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,510
There is an artist in the capital
called Ning Buyi,

651
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,310
whose skills are quite good.

652
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,470
He often helps at the prefect's office.

653
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,200
I'll send for him immediately.

654
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,720
What did you send Bai Feng to do?

655
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,880
Is there something wrong
with the cinnabar?

656
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
In the case files left behind
by Lord Shen,

657
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,030
there is a murder case in Guanyin Town
six years ago.

658
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,990
That murder case had
three victims in total,

659
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,720
and around each victim's body,

660
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,230
there was cinnabar scattered everywhere,

661
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,030
along with the Black Unrighteous Flower
drawn with lead chalk.

662
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,560
Black Unrighteous Flower?

663
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,560
Master.

664
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,220
Your Highness.

665
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,230
Found it.

666
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,420
You may go now.

667
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,610
Yes, Master.

668
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,360
These are the postmortem reports
of the three victims from back then.

669
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,240
Though crude,

670
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,160
they still provide some information.

671
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
The suspect in that case was
eventually apprehended.

672
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,800
But after Lord Shen's incident,

673
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,060
all files with his annotations were
confiscated,

674
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,320
so we cannot determine

675
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,260
why exactly

676
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,150
the Guanyin Town murder case

677
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,110
was designated as a doubtful case.

[Postmortem Report]

679
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,460
Death by skin peeling.

680
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,030
Death by tongue extraction.

cinnabar...

684
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,630
My father wouldn't have classified

685
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,719
the case in Guanyin Town as suspicious
without reason.

686
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,469
It seems

687
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,150
the arrested perpetrator might not be
the real culprit.

688
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,230
If this case is truly connected to
the case in Guanyin Town,

689
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,590
could it be that the real culprit

690
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,420
has returned to strike again
in the capital?

691
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,610
But we can't rule out the possibility

692
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,760
that someone might be using that case
to incite public panic.

693
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,219
Whatever the truth may be,

694
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,630
if we don't catch the real killer of

695
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,960
this flaying case soon,

696
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,719
I'm afraid there will be more victims.

697
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,239
Is that suspect still alive?

698
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,150
Yes, he is.

699
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,900
But he refuses to confess.

700
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,840
And because this case was classified
as suspicious,

701
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,360
he's been detained in prison
awaiting execution.

702
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,560
I want you to meet him.

703

Mr. Ning, hello.

Please pay your respects to Lord Yan Chi

Your Highness.

711

Come with me.

712
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,200
Mr. Ning is shocked.

713
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,730
I've never seen him so flustered before.

714
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,880

715

I'm truly sorry.

I...

717
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,300
have never seen

718
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,330
such a gruesome sight before.

719
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,550
I couldn't hold myself together...

720
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,030
and have embarrassed myself
before you both.

721
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,800
It's normal for people
to feel uncomfortable

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,150
when seeing a body for the first time.

723

I'm sorry that you've had to
endure this, Mr. Ning.

as capable as Lord Shen

758

who could prove your innocence,

759
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,290
would you take that chance?

760
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,840
With a flick of my fingers, I divined

761
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,920
that the person is definitely not you.

762
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,120
You just need to know
that someone can help you.

Clean yourself up a bit tonight.

that the person is actually a woman.

In this prison,

767
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,460
I eat rotten and cold food

768
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,920
and wear tattered clothes.

769
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,960
Even if I wanted to help that noble lady,

770

I'm too weak to speak.

How do you know he's not
an heir to a prince?

778
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,800
I heard it.

779
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,840
When the two of you walked in just now,

780
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,420
he was asking questions

781
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,120
while Your Highness was pacing around.

782
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,970
If he were an heir to a prince

783
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,190
and you were his subordinate,

784
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,840
how could he dare to walk around

785
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,570
while you were questioning me?

786
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,780
Do you know why we're here?

787
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,020
Your Highness

788
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,230
cares more about my life than I do myself.

789
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
Could it be that I

790
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,210
have finally caught a lucky break?

791
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,700
Mind your tongue!

792
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,860
Boss, can we drink tomorrow instead?

793
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,700
Xiaocui at Tianxiang House is
waiting for me.

794
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,180
Things haven't been peaceful lately.

795
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,380
Be careful,
or you might get skinned alive too.

796
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,180
No... that can't happen, right?

797
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,360
No wonder you can be so cheeky.

798
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,780
Even locked away in this prison,

799
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,380
you can stay well-informed.

800
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,110
During these five years in prison,

801
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,590
I've heard these rumors

802
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,210
and bits of gossip every day.

803
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,970
It's just that it's cold and damp here,

804
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,540
with spoiled rice and cold food...

805
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,350
Then tell me,

806
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,850
what do you want?

807
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,110
I want

808
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,480
rock sugar-braised pork knuckle.

809
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,320
Do you think you're in any position

810
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,050
to negotiate with me right now?

811
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,280
I heard that in the capital,

812
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,560
there's been a case identical to the one
in Guanyin Town.

813
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,360
Your Highness is probably even more

814
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,800
anxious than I am, right?

815
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,180
Fine then.

816
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,470
You can just wait here.

817
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,510
Your Highness,

818
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,320
the rock sugar-braised pork knuckle
must be eaten while hot!

819
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,980
That's when it's fragrant, tender,
and fall-off-the-bone soft!

820
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,670
Rock sugar-braised pork knuckle!

821
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,090
Rock sugar-braised pork knuckle...

822
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,320
Miss,

823
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,670
have you seen this person?

824
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,530
Never seen him.

825
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,920
Is this...

826
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,250
supposed to be a person?

827
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,070
Is it not?

828
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,100
Don't know him.

829
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,010
Never seen him.

830
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,360
Yan Li will be fine.

831
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,850
He will definitely be.

832
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,360
He has nine lives.

833
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,410
I will definitely find him.

834
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,180
Have you seen this person?

835
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,840
Never seen him.

836
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,770
Have you seen him?

837
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,630
Never seen him.

838
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,440
Have you seen him?

839
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,300
Never seen him.

840
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,560
Note this:

841
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,010
no obvious foreign objects
in the deceased's chest,

842
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,010
abdomen, nasal cavity, or trachea.

843
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,440
The liver and kidneys show
no signs of toxins.

844
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,880
However, the victim had consumed
a large amount of alcohol

845
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,280
prior to being abducted.

846
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,440
The heart shows no damage

847
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,570
but is pale in color,

848
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,190
consistent with syncope
caused by extreme pain,

849
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,280
followed by cardiac failure
due to insufficient blood flow.

850
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,540
Indeed, he was tortured to death in pain.

851
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,650
Note this:

852
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,450
food remnants are still present
in the stomach.

853
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,380
The last meal

854
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,530
was about four hours

855
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,550
before death.

856
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,960
Judging by the food remnants,

857
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,750
the last meal included crab.

858
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,230
Crab's hard to come by this season,

859
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,340
but some upscale restaurants

860
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,030
reserve it for wealthy families.

861
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,070
Shall we search all the restaurants
in the city?

862
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,630
We can't.

863
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,630
His Majesty has specifically instructed

864
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,890
that this matter concerns
the capital's security,

865
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,320
and we must not disturb the citizens

866
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,280
or incite panic.

867
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,230
Can you determine whether the crab was
stir-fried or steamed?

868
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,550
What's the difference?

869
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,880
When the body was discovered,

870
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,900
the time of death was estimated to be
within four hours,

871
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,490
indicating that the location
where the killer skinned the victim

872
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,310
is likely close to where the body was
dumped and where the kidnapping occurred.

873
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,570
And that alley where the body was dumped

874
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,410
has a restaurant in front
and Fengqi House behind.

875
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,990
That restaurant specializes in
stir-fried crab,

876
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,070
whereas Fengqi House

877
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,800
is famous for its steamed crab.

878
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,870
So young, yet already leading
a dissolute life.

879
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,380
What's wrong with friends
having social gatherings at a restaurant?

880
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,170
Besides,

881
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,600
Yan Li told me about that steamed crab.

882
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,410
Then you're all leading dissolute lives
at such a young age.

883
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,990
There are no heavy seasoning residues
in the stomach,

884
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,250
so it was steamed crab.

885
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,100
Okay...

886
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,840
Constable Zhan!

887
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,960
Go to Fengqi House immediately

888
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,240
and check which customers ordered

889
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,960
steamed crab during the afternoon

890
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,440
and evening of the day of the incident.

891
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:15,970
Yes, sir.

892
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,840
Master Wan, your deduction is
precise and thorough,

893
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,780
which reminds me of someone.

894
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,290
Who?

895
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,260
None other than my mentor,

896
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,820
the late Lord Shen Yi.

897
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,150
The solemnity in your expression
during the autopsy

898
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,400
mirrors that of

899
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,650
my mentor's demeanor

900
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,800
during autopsies.

901
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,450
I used to believe

902
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,200
Master Wan's autopsy skills were
unmatched.

903
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,550
If Lord Shen were still alive,

904
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,280
perhaps they could have learned from
each other.

905
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,520
I've spoken out of turn.

906
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,250
His Majesty is waiting for my report.

907
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,720
I must take my leave.

908
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,760
Get there safely, Lord Li.

909
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,110
Let's go to
the Ministry of Justice prison.

910
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:22,960
Why the rush?

911
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,300
Since he said I resemble
Lord Shen somewhat,

912
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,470
I must quickly

913
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,580
resolve the suspicious case he left behind

914
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,150
to live up to this honor.
