[Episode 31]

3
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,240
What are you doing?

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,430
You dare to kill me?

5
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,990
Yan Chi.

6
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,500
Yan Chi.

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,610
What are you going to do?

8
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,229
You wouldn't dare.

9
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,200
You wouldn't dare!

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,070
How dare you?

11
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,610
Yan Chi! You wouldn't dare!

12
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,150
Don't!

13
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,070
Don't!

14
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,260
Let's go.

15
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,890
Yan Chi,

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,990
it's war between us now!

17
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,780
Why did you take the risk alone?

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,060
With the arranged marriage list,

19
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
I suspected Yan Qi was behind it,

20
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,829
so I wanted to see what he was up to.

21
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,160
I never expected

22
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,530
he would be even more

23
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,790
audacious and shameless than I thought.

24
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,579
Did they hurt you anywhere else?

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Do you think I'm tainted now?

26
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,570
Of course not.

27
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,750
I just feel I failed to protect you—

28
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,080
that's why you got hurt.

29
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,570
Wan,

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,280
you don't have to think about
anything now.

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,190
Just get ready to be my bride.

32
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,340
The humiliation I suffered today—

33
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,190
I'll repay it double.

34
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,440
I'll repay it double.

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,060
Your Highness!

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,380
Your Highness, you...

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,070
What's wrong?

38
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Are you hurt?

39
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,420
What are you doing here?

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,780
You didn't come back last night.

41
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,750
The Noble Consort was so worried
she couldn't sleep.

42
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,660
I thought maybe you went night hunting

43
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,890
on a whim,

44
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,560
but I was afraid something might've
happened to you,

45
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,910
so I came to find you.

46
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,149
What's going on here?

47
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,130
I...

48
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,600
Greeting, Your Highness.

49
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
So, you and Feng Chenbi have long

50
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,620
had feelings for each other.

51
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,840
Then I

52
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,360
shall not disturb you.

53
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,159
Let's go.

54
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,800
Your Highness.

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,120
You did that on purpose just now.

56
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,810
Your Highness.

57
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,580
I...

58
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,320
I truly care about you.

59
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,910
Truly?

60
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,200
Did you also "truly" care

61
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
for the Crown Prince before?

62
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,320
Feng Chenbi,

63
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,230
drop the act.

64
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,840
I know

65
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,130
better than you what kind of heart
hides under

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,430
that painted face.

67
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,260
I don't want your heart.

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,970
So why care about mine?

69
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,010
I just want a husband

70
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,920
who can rival the Crown Prince—

71
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,210
someone who can put me on equal footing
with Qin Zhaoyu,

72
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,260
or even help me enter the Eastern Palace
one day as Crown Princess,

73
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
and eventually become the Empress.

74
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,700
What's wrong with that?

75
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,550
Don't play this game with me.

76
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:00,980
Tell me,

77
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,690
who sent you here?

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,750
Speak!

79
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,970
No one!

80
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,370
You people from the Feng family...

81
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,620
are really...

82
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,500
Your Highness,

83
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,810
as long as you're willing to marry me
as your primary consort,

84
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,340
there's so much our Feng family
can do for you.

85
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,460
I can't stand Qin Zhaoyu,

86
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
and you can't stand the Crown Prince

87
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,740
or Yan Chi.

88
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,250
How could you take on both of them alone?

89
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,260
We can join forces

90
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,860
to deal with them together.

91
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,830
There's only one.

92
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,990
Only the Crown Prince!

93
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,430
So Feng Chenbi really does want to
become Princess Consort Cheng.

94
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,250
Prince Cheng.

95
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,330
Prince Cheng.

96
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,060
I, Qin Xiang,
respectfully greet Your Highness.

97
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,820
Your surname is Qin?

98
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,830
Then you and Qin Wan...

99
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,210
I dare not hide from Your Highness.

100
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,470
I'm the fifth sister of Princess Yongci.

101
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,450
You came here so early in the morning

102
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,050
just to let your grandmother

103
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,860
try your fried fish?

104
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,710
Grandmother,

105
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,210
you may not know this,

106
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,580
but this fish

107
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,860
is called peach blossom fish.

108
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,620
It's only available

109
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,180
when the peach trees
are in full bloom every year,

110
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,620
and it's incredibly fresh and delicious.

111
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,500
We hold hunting banquets every year.

112
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,980
I've never heard of
any peach blossom fish.

113
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,980
Did these fish

114
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,060
swim here on their own?

115
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,130
Grandmother, if you like it,

116
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,830
I'll bring it to you every year
as a token of my filial respect.

117
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,500
A token of your filial respect?

118
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,330
Not because of that fight
with Qi yesterday?

119
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,690
That little scuffle's hardly worth
bothering you over.

120
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,250
besides, I didn't really hurt him.

121
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,140
So...

122
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,150
why are you being

123
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,610
so attentive?

124
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:47,770
Tell the truth.

125
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,140
If you don't,

126
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,850
I'm not eating

127
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,780
this token of your filial respect.

128
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
Then I'll tell you the truth.

129
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,540
I sincerely wish to marry Princess Yongci

130
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,900
as my primary consort,

131
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,120
and I humbly ask for your decree
to grant this marriage.

132
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,020
You always made excuses

133
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,810
whenever I mentioned the marriage before.

134
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,220
Why are you suddenly asking
to marry Wan today?

135
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,300
I dare not hide it from you.

136
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,060
Princess Yongci has many admirers.

137
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,510
I've long admired her

138
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,280
and can't wait any longer.

139
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,060
That's honest of you.

140
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,540
But

141
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,660
I've allowed Wan
to choose her own marriage.

142
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,940
If you want me to grant her to you,

143
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,300
she must agree first.

144
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,560
Otherwise, people will say

145
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,210
I'm abusing my power.

146
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,470
Grandmother,

147
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,730
please stop teasing me.

148
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,100
With your keen eyes,

149
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,450
can't you see

150
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,420
we've long been in love?

151
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,230
Since that's the case,

152
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,250
I have a question for you.

153
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,130
Wan is no ordinary girl.

154
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,520
Can you promise never to betray her?

155
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,270
I, Yan Chi, swear here that

156
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,140
if I ever betray her,
may heaven strike me down

157
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,870
and disown me from the Yan clan.

158
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,890
Thank you, Grandmother.

159
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,470
There was so much chaos during

160
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,580
the Double Third Festival hunt!

161
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,730
It's utterly disgraceful!

162
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,740
It's my fault for failing in my duty
as an elder brother.

163
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,200
Please punish me, Father.

164
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,890
Punish you?

165
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,900
How should I punish you?

166
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,620
A prince and a royal heir

167
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
fought over a single prey.

168
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,710
If word gets out,

169
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,920
what will become
of the royal family's dignity?

170
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,300
The Noble Consort is here!

171
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,420
Your Majesty!

172
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,610
Your Majesty!

173
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,490
Your Majesty,

174
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,540
Zhang is the only son
of my maternal family.

175
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,140
Now he's dead
under suspicious circumstances.

176
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,780
I beg you to investigate thoroughly

177
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,490
and seek justice for me!

178
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,210
A weapon knows no friend or foe.

179
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,070
How am I supposed to investigate?

180
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
Then investigate those who

181
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,440
were at the hunt.

182
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,900
Arrest them all

183
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,210
and question them one by one.

184
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,730
We'll surely discover something.

185
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,090
You're being ridiculous.

186
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,540
I was also at the hunt.

187
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,570
Injuries and deaths during a hunt

188
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,030
are inevitable.

189
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,060
Your Feng family lost a son,

190
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,580
and now you expect me,

191
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,540
the Crown Prince, and Prince Cheng

192
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,730
to be arrested and interrogated?

193
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,060
Enough.

194
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,150
This

195
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,740
was purely an accident.

196
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,330
Stop making baseless accusations.

197
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,470
By the way,

198
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,660
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau
has completed its calculations.

199
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Qi and Duke of Zhong's
legitimate eldest daughter

200
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,380
are truly a match made in heaven.

201
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,990
Impossible, impossible!

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,510
I clearly reported...

203
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,180
[Feng Chenbi]

204
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,620
What do you mean by this, Prince Cheng?

205
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,330
The list was personally delivered to
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau by Noble Consort Su.

206
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,330
It wasn't handed off to anyone else.

207
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,420
There's no way there was a mistake.

208
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,690
The Crown Prince is well aware

209
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,640
of the deep affection
between you and Miss Feng.

210
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,380
If you deny it now,

211
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,190
how will Miss Feng

212
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,360
face others in the future?

213
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,550
I don't believe

214
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,670
Prince Cheng is a fickle man.

215
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,290
I

216
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,140
will obey the decree, Your Majesty.

217
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,630
Very well.

218
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,690
Since you agree,

219
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,420
I will decree

220
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,940
your marriage

221
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,270
along with the Crown Prince's,

222
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,850
so you may soon set a date.

223
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,020
-Thank you,
-Thank you,

224
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,780
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

225
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,690
Thank you, Father.

226
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,660
Alright, alright.

227
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,690
you may both rise.

228
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,140
Report!

229
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,780
Your Majesty,

230
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,110
this is a decree from the Empress Dowager.

231
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,060
Please read it.

232
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,780
Good.

233
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,490
Great!

234
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,440
Well,

235
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,610
the Empress Dowager has also arranged

236
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,900
Chi's marriage.

237
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,090
Now,

238
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,340
the palace

239
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,450
is filled with joyous occasions.

240
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,480
Wonderful!

241
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,420
Xiang, you're hurt?

242
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,490
No.

243
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,730
Yes, you are. I just saw it.

244
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,260
Who did this to you?

245
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,960
Come on,

246
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,180
let's go find Aunt.

247
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,660
Mind your own business.

248
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,020
If you dare tell others,

249
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,660
our sisterhood is over!

250
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,570
Xiang...

251
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,090
Shut up!

252
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,720
I didn't expect

253
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,020
His Majesty would
let last night's incident go so easily.

254
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,150
So what if he didn't?

255
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,180
Yan Qi is the mastermind.

256
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,980
He naturally won't admit it.

257
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,660
Feng Chenbi dares not say anything either.

258
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,320
His Majesty

259
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,180
wouldn't create trouble for himself.

260
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,380
Given Prince Cheng's vengeful nature,

261
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,790
I don't think he'll let it drop easily.

262
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,110
I have a feeling

263
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,060
he has a bigger scheme.

264
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,010
I share your concern.

265
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,610
Do you know

266
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
why Yan Qi hasn't gone to his domain?

267
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,020
Because of the Crown Prince's position?

268
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,570
No.

269
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,130
What he wants

270
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,090
is the key supply base for provisions
and warhorses—

271
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,890
Liangzhou.

272
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,870
A vital stronghold in Shuoxi?

273
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,060
So the mastermind
behind the military provision case...

274
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,320
Could very well be him.

275
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,330
Or the Crown Prince.

276
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,250
Or even...

277
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,540
His Majesty.

278
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,690
His Majesty wants Shuoxi Army.

279
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,670
My father's stubbornness

280
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,780
has already
crossed His Majesty's red line.

281
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,260
Although I used
the military provision case

282
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,610
to defend my father before His Majesty

283
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,530
when I returned to the capital,

284
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,910
it's not a long-term solution.

285
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,730
Why doesn't Prince Rui understand

286
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,930
that you came to the capital as a hostage

287
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,340
to guarantee his and Shuoxi Army's safety?

288
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,150
He does understand,

289
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,450
but in his heart,

290
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,970
a general should hold a seat in court
through glorious military achievements.

291
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,100
While my strategies

292
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,560
are nothing but political maneuvering.

293
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,090
Right now, in His Majesty's eyes,

294
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,180
I'm my father's spy placed in the capital.

295
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,510
And in my father's eyes,

296
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,140
I'm a cowardly rebellious son.

297
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,970
Don't meddle in Prince Jin's case anymore.

298
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,780
Why?

299
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,020
Li Muyun is suspicious
about the unidentified body

300
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,420
at Prince Jin's Mansion,

301
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,300
but he hasn't stopped me
from investigating further.

302
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,140
I suspect

303
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,200
he's waiting for me to make a mistake.

304
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,540
If His Majesty finds out

305
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,260
you're trying to reopen Prince Jin's case,

306
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,020
I'm afraid your situation
will become even more dangerous.

307
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,020
Then I certainly can't let you
face this danger alone.

308
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,330
Besides,

309
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,940
the Empress Dowager
has already granted our marriage.

310
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,740
From now on, as husband and wife,

311
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,560
our fates are bound together.

312
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,220
Wan,

313
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,810
the road ahead will be full of danger.

314
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,670
Are you willing to face it with me?

315
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,810
I am.

316
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,290
Let

317
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,160
Qin Zhaoyu,

318
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,859
Feng Chenbi,

319
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,550
and Princess Yongci

320
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,770
come forward to hear the decree.

321
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,370
By the Empress Dowager's decree,

322
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,930
Qin Zhaoyu, daughter of Marquis of
Zhongyong, Qin Shuzhi,

323
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,740
is virtuous, composed,

324
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,450
modest, and respectful.

325
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,320
The Empress Dowager is pleased
with her conduct

326
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,410
and hereby grants her
in marriage to Crown Prince Yan Che

327
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,970
as Crown Princess.

328
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,380
Feng Chenbi, daughter of Duke of Zhong,
Feng Bingyi,

329
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,040
is gentle, gracious,

330
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,250
proper, and exemplary in behavior.

331
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,860
She is hereby granted in marriage
to Prince Cheng, Yan Qi,

332
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,540
as his primary consort.

333
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,470
Princess Yongci, Qin Wan, adopted daughter

334
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,230
of Marquis of Anyang, Yue Qiong,

335
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,180
is refined in manners

336
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,900
and unceasing in diligence.

337
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,730
She is hereby granted in marriage
to the Heir of Prince Rui, Yan Chi,

338
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,230
as his consort.

339
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,830
The relevant ministry shall choose
an auspicious date for the weddings.

340
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,190
Thus decreed.

341
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,330
Thank you, Your Majesty.

342
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,930
These flowers are so beautiful.

343
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,920
Let's go take a look over there.

344
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
So pretty.

345
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,450
Then we're leaving.

346
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,620
Let's go.

347
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,490
Xiang, stop drinking.

348
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,490
It's a serious offense
to be drunk in front of the Emperor.

349
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,100
Madam.

350
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,050
If we bring trouble on the Qin family

351
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,540
at the Spring Banquet,

352
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,850
Uncle and Aunt will eat us alive.

353
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
You may fear them,

354
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,580
but I don't.

355
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,700
One day, when I climb to a higher status,

356
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,010
even they will have to kneel before me.

357
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,010
Xiang, please don't talk nonsense.

358
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,120
You need a ladder
to climb to a higher status.

359
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,200
Those princes

360
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,620
are closely watched by His Majesty

361
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,770
and the powerful ministers.

362
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,290
You don't have a chance with any of them.

363
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,890
So don't even dream about it.

364
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,010
Xiang.

365
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,530
Xiang...

366
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,480
Your Highness, you're truly gallant!

367
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,050
Let's go take a look too.

368
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,340
Chi, is this a wild goose?

369
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,270
Great Aunt,

370
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,500
with this wild goose as a betrothal gift,

371
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,690
I humbly ask you
to consent to the marriage

372
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,020
of your sworn granddaughter Qin Wan to me.

373
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,520
The Empress Dowager has already
given her decree, right?

374
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,040
What else can I say?

375
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,510
This is quite a grand gesture.

376
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,960
Truly impressive.

377
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,670
For your sincerity,

378
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,770
alright!

379
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,820
Today I accept you

380
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,000
as my sworn grandson-in-law.

381
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,450
Thank you, Great Aunt.

382
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,770
Your Majesty.

383
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,940
Chi is truly happy

384
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,140
about this marriage.

385
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,530
Good.

386
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,900
That's good.

387
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,820
Since you are happy,

388
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,340
I feel

389
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,890
I've fulfilled my duty

390
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,870
to Prince Rui.

391
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

392
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
Report!

393
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,140
Your Majesty!

394
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,180
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

395
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,510
Being flustered like this—how improper!

396
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,580
This...

397
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:45,900
This...

398
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,580
-Father!
-Father!

399
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,260
Father, please take care of your health!

400
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,400
Father, please sit down.

401
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,730
-Your Majesty!
-What is this?

402
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,770
Your Majesty!

403
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,440
Mother!

404
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,250
Mother, please don't look!

405
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,200
Don't look at it!

406
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,010
-Your Majesty!
-Grandmother!

407
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,210
-Sister-in-law!
-Grandmother!

408
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,010
Your Majesty!

409
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,690
Check on her!

410
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,860
Mother!

411
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,450
Help the Empress Dowager back
to her room to rest now.

412
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,490
Hurry!

413
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,770
Come on.

414
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,190
Be careful, Grandmother.

415
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,370
This...

416
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,390
Yuan Qing,

417
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,990
what exactly happened?

418
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,520
Prince Rui...

419
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,690
Prince Rui...

420
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,800
My brother Prince Rui...

421
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,870
has passed away!

422
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,870
My dear brother Prince Rui!

423
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,730
Yan Chi.

424
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,210
Yan Chi.

425
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,340
I am already your wife.

426
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,250
No matter what happens,

427
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,340
I will face it with you.

428
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,970
Remember that.

429
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,910
Will Grandmother recover?

430
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,070
She'll be fine.

431
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,060
His Majesty is here!

432
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,350
Alright, no need for formalities.

433
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,210
How is the Empress Dowager?

434
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,210
Grandmother hasn't eaten anything

435
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,140
and refuses to take her medicine.

436
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,870
Wan,

437
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,860
have you administered acupuncture
to the Empress Dowager?

438
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,530
Her Majesty is still deep in sorrow.

439
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,660
It's too risky to perform acupuncture now,

440
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,940
so we can only treat her
with medicine for the time being.

441
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,380
You all wait outside the tent;

442
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,580
I'll go in and see her.

443
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,990
Greetings, Your Majesty.

444
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,290
Greetings, Mother.

445
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,130
Mother...

446
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,130
Let me

447
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,510
feed you your medicine.

448
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,150
Mother,

449
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,100
you're tormenting yourself like this.

450
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,090
How can I be at peace?

451
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,080
Mother,

452
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,670
now that Lin is gone,

453
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,010
do you not want me anymore?

454
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,380
I am

455
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,800
also your son.

456
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,940
Bring Lin...

457
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,580
back to me.

458
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,120
Rest assured, Mother.

459
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,210
I've already ordered Chi to depart quickly

460
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,070
and bring Lin back to the capital.

461
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,410
Mother!

462
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,100
Your Majesty,

463
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,420
please take care of your health.

464
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,180
Don't worry about the Empress Dowager.

465
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,720
I am here to take care of her.

466
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,870
You should go back and rest.

467
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,270
Thank you, Aunt.

468
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,250
Well, Mother,

469
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,490
please take good care of yourself.

470
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,230
I'll...

471
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,750
take my leave.

472
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,460
Don't be afraid.

473
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,320
Grandmother will be fine.

474
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,290
Li.

475
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
Spend more time

476
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,560

477
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,630

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,630
Yes!

514
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,580
You two,

515
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,710
lift it a bit higher.

516
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,450
Yes.

517
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,290
Hurry up.

518
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,330
Take all these over there.

519
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:18,990
Right away.

520
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,990
Your Highness,
the medicinal decoction is ready.

521
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,530
Pour the herbal decoction over the bones

522
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,400
to remove the cadaveric wax.

523
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,960
Yes.

524
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,030
Add three liters of wine
and five liters of vinegar.

525
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,460
If you have anything to say,

526
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,610
let it show

527
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,450
so I can see it.

528
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,980
Father,

529
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,420
throughout history, no emperor

530
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,220
has allowed military power to slip away.

531
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,010
His Majesty wants his Shuoxi Army,

532
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,820
not Prince Rui's private troops.

533
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,450
The struggle for succession
in the capital is full of intrigue.

534
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,450
Shuoxi Army is surrounded by enemies.

535
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,550
As long as you return to the capital
with me to hand over the tiger tally,

536
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,290
and as long as you're no longer
suspected by His Majesty,

537
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,730
Shuoxi Army can be protected

538
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,970
from gradual dismantling.

539
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,690
Silence!

540
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,940
I am His Majesty's
full brother by the same mother.

541
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,230
How can there be a loss of military power?

542
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,530
Before His Majesty
went to the front lines,

543
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,900
he entrusted Shuoxi to me.

544
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,910
He entrusted me
with this strategic territory.

545
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,770
His Majesty is always wise and benevolent.

546
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,530
He trusts me

547
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,750
as much as himself.

548
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,880
No matter how others try to sow discord,

549
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,530
as long as His Majesty hasn't
taken back the tiger tally,

550
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,680
I will keep

551
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,940
defending Shuoxi.

552
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,990
But Father,

553
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,940
people change.

554
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,620
If His Majesty truly trusted you
without doubt,

555
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,730
why didn't he first investigate
the Ministry of War and Ministry of Revenue,

556
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,350
instead of sending me back to Shuoxi Army
to investigate corruption?

557
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,130
Father,

558
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,450
during these days in the capital,
I've seen things clearly.

559
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,980
His Majesty is deep-minded

560
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,940
and skilled in balancing power.

561
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,620
He is wary even of the Empress Dowager

562
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,940
and the Crown Prince,

563
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,470
let alone you, his brother.

564
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,490
After all these years,

565
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,490
he's no longer

566
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,890
the new emperor
who just ascended the throne.

567
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,570
His Majesty ordered you to investigate,

568
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,050
then do so.

569
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,160
I have lived an upright life.

570
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,400
While guarding the border,

571
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,580
I've never harbored
any selfish intentions.

572
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,130
The reputation of Shuoxi Army

573
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,790
cannot be destroyed
by a few corrupt officials.

574
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,600
After you finish your duties,

575
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,270
you should...

576
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,210
return to the capital as soon as you can.

577
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,900
Father,

578
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,180
the difficulty isn't in the investigation

579
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,140
but in His Majesty's suspicion.

580
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,340
If you use the military supplies
as a reason

581
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,290
to return to the capital with me
and hand over the tiger tally,

582
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,950
His Majesty will thoroughly investigate
the corrupt officials.

583
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,650
Even without you,

584
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,300
Shuoxi Army

585
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,060
will have a new commander.

586
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,650
It's mid-spring now,

587
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,170
the time when the nomadic enemies

588
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,820
raid everywhere.

589
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,010
Once they learn that Shuoxi Army
has a new commander,

590
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,139
war will break out on the border again.

591
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,380
Years ago,

592
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,380
I swore to the new emperor

593
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,170
that I would not leave Shuoxi

594
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,500
until the nomadic enemies were defeated.

595
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,170
Those words still ring in my ears.

596
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,170
How could I become an oath-breaker?

597
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,230
But Father...

598
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,420
Rest assured.

599
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,300
When I eventually enter the capital
to see His Majesty,

600
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,969
I will return the tiger tally to him.

601
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,489
Father,

602
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,449
now, His Majesty,
the Crown Prince, and Prince Cheng

603
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:02,780
are determined to seize control
of the Shuoxi Army.

604
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,040
The one who tried to assassinate us

605
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,780
must be from one of these three parties.

606
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,940
Nowadays, His Majesty

607
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,130
values military power
more than border security.

608
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,700
No one knows how many people
Prince Cheng and the Crown Prince

609
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,860
have planted in the grain transport
and supply lines.

610
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,050
Once war breaks out again,

611
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,700
Shuoxi Army will be attacked
from both the front and the rear.

612
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,560
If you keep clinging to your oath,

613
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,780
you're just sending us to die for nothing.

614
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,820
Shuoxi Army has achieved many victories.

615
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,850
How could His Majesty
allow schemers to cause trouble

616
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,480
and destroy his own defenses?

617
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,210
Generals should die in battle.

618
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,240
If that day really comes,

619
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,010
then it's our fate.

620
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,130
But why?

621
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,810
Why should I and the soldiers

622
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,970
who've followed you for years

623
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,220
die in vain

624
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,550
just because of an oath?

625
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,220
This isn't fate!

626
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,780
It's foolishness!

627
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:44,890
Get out!

628
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,890
I have no cowardly son like you!

629
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,610
Father,

630
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,340
whether you're willing or not,

631
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,870
you're coming back
to the capital with me this time.

632
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,140
[Memorial Tablet of My Late Father,
Prince Rui, Yan Ling]

633
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,150
Young Marshal!

634
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,640
Young Marshal! Young Marshal!

635
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,570
Young Marshal!

636
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,570
You may take out the remains.

637
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,310
This smell...

638
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,370
What is that smell?

639
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,860
What is that smell?

640
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,260
It's awful.

641
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,970
Anyone feeling sick, step away.

642
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:06,780
Yes.

643
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,740
Constable Zhan,

644
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,170
I'll describe, and you record.

645
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,920
Alright.

646
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,520
Minister Li.

647
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,980
This is where the Her Highness
performed the bone steaming.

648
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,990
Your Highness.

649
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,130
May I ask

650
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,010
where you learned

651
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,490
this technique?

652
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,750
From books.

653
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,010
Constable Zhan,

654
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,940
write this down.

655
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,320
There's a dark purplish blood stain

656
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,740
on the occipital bone—

657
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,240
likely caused by a blunt force strike.

658
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,800
The victim also has reddish cracks

659
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,430
and blood stain

660
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,400
on both clavicles,

661
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,490
the third and fourth ribs
on the left side,

662
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,740
the left wrist, the right shinbone,

663
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,640
and both kneecaps.

664
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,900
This indicates he was likely
beaten by multiple people

665
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,100
or for an extended period before death.

666
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,420
The right ulna

667
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,220
also shows signs of impact—
blood stains and fine fractures—

668
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,010
likely from heavy force.

669
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,300
Possibly from raising his arm

670
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,650
to block a heavy punch during a fight,

671
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,050
or bracing himself with his arm

672
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,510
when falling from a horse.

673
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,930
But the wounds alone

674
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,860
cannot prove the identity of the deceased.

675
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,260
Besides the injuries,

676
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,940
the deceased's legs are uneven in length.

677
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,960
The left knee bends inward,

678
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,450
so when standing,

679
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,240
the right leg
should appear slightly longer.

680
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,000
When walking,

681
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,820
the shoulders would naturally
sway up and down.

682
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,450
The deceased had
a stable lower body stance,

683
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,540
usually

684
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,090
generating power with the left leg

685
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,300
and striking with the right.

686
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,260
Judging by this,

687
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,010
the deceased was no ordinary
bandit or guard.

688
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,840
He was likely a bodyguard or escort—

689
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,820
someone properly trained in martial arts.

690
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,200
The burial in Prince Jin's Mansion
is no coincidence.

691
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,010
Prefect Zheng, Minister Li,

692
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,420
you can look for clues
among Prince Jin's servants or guards

693
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,650
to identify him.

694
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,970
The files of Prince Jin's former personnel

695
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,820
are all kept at the Supreme Court.

696
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,080
Minister Li, I'll trouble you with this.

697
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,110
But why

698
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,700
start with Prince Jin's former personnel?

699
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,920
Prince Jin's Mansion
has been sealed for over a year.

700
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,360
The death occurred

701
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,910
about a year ago.

702
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,740
The body was likely buried in the backyard

703
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,300
before Prince Jin's Mansion was sealed.

704
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,570
All the guards are more or less involved.

705
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,280
Constable Zhan,

706
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,380
send the remains back to the morgue.

707
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,610
They will serve as evidence

708
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,870
at the interrogation.

709
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,590
Your Highness,

710
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,880
the Disgraced Prince

711
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,160
indeed had an armed guard

712
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,810
of Western origin

713
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,360
named Song Xiwen.

714
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,920
But if this corpse is him,

715
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,260
I'm afraid

716
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,510
it's beyond the three of us

717
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,960
to handle.

718
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,450
Why?

719
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,980
Because Song Xiwen

720
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,000
was supposed to be detained in

721
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,930
in the Imperial Punishment Department.

722
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,990
The Imperial Punishment Department?

723
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,390
The place where palace maids are punished?

724
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,420
Exactly.

725
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,350
So how did he escape

726
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,300
from the tightly guarded
Imperial Punishment Department?

727
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,650
And who killed him?

728
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,170
If we dig too deep,

729
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm afraid

730
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,050
many will be implicated.

731
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,640
Since Song Xiwen
was a guard of Prince Jin's Mansion,

732
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,650
why did he end up
in the Imperial Punishment Department?

733
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,050
What crime did he commit?

734
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:46,890
This...

735
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,820
This...

736
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,180
involves the Disgraced Prince.

737
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,240
I'm sorry,

738
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,880
but I cannot say anything.

739
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,270
Minister Li,
I believe you understand this principle:

740
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,340
one mistake leads
to ten more to cover it up.

741
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,700
The more you try to cover up mistakes,

742
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,300
the more errors you'll make.

743
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,490
Since these remains

744
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,570
appeared where they shouldn't have,

745
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,530
we must report honestly.

746
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,450
As for who might be implicated,

747
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,610
that should be for His Majesty to decide.

748
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,170
Your Highness, you're right.

749
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,230
We will definitely report
our findings to His Majesty.

750
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,700
Then thank you for your hard work.

751
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,610
Not at all.

752
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,670
We'll draft the memorial right away.

753
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
After you, Mr. Li.

754
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,060
Yan Chi,

755
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,900
I've finally found the breakthrough
in Prince Jin's case.

756
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,530
You must return safely.

757
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,850
Your Majesty,

758
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,360
the Heir of Prince Rui has escorted
Prince Rui's coffin into the capital.

759
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,740
When the decree was issued,

760
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,760
was Yan Chi

761
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,580
calm?

762
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,930
His Highness

763
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,060
only presented the tiger tally
of Shuoxi Army to you,

764
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,420
saying nothing else.

765
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,680
It's finally back.
