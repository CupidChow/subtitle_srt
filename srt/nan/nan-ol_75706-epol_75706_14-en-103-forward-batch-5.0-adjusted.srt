[Episode 14]

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,150
Timing is key when using

4
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,870
the dragon blood herb in medicine.

5
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,039
It must be simmered

6
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,640
over low heat for four hours,

7
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,130
not a moment less.

8
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,200
Otherwise,

9
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,790
it'll lose all efficacy.

10
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,730
The medicine is ready.

11
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,470
I've tasted it.

12
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,900
Not bitter at all.

13
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,150
Really.

14
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,630
You liar—

15
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,070
Right?

16
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
I didn't lie, huh?

17
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,000
Isn't this candy really sweet

18
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,590
and not bitter at all?

19
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,300
Time for your medicine.

20
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,280
What tricks do you have today?

21
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,150
No tricks today.

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
Finish the medicine,

23
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
and I'll perform

24
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,970
anything you want,

25
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,840
as you command.

26
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Chew on Chinese goldthread dry!

27
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,270
Jin'an.

28
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,720
Hey, brother.

29
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,270
Wait!

30
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,000
I need to talk to you.

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,560
Come on.

32
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,310
You need me?

33
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,070
Let's have a chat.

34
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,430
Sit.

35
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,740
Good wine and food.

36
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,750
Is this a trap?

37
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,120
You've been getting along

38
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,520
well with General, yeah?

39
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,000
Sort of.

40
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,740
Teach me your ways.

41
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,390
T-Teach you?

42
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,600
Teach you w-what?

43
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
There's a girl I'm interested in.

44
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,940
But I thought Lu Xin was

45
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,870
already spoken for?

46
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,980
It's not Lu Xin.

47
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,270
-You like her too?
-You like her too?

48
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,920
You go first.

49
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,530
Qiao!

50
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,230
Good taste.

51
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,460
I thought...

52
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,630
So you like Qiao?

53
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,220
Yes.

54
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Isn't she wonderful?

55
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,560
The first time I saw her,

56
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,480
she lifted a carriage with her bare hands.

57
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,740
She's stronger than me

58
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,400
and eats way more than I do.

59
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,710
She's all I can think about.

60
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,750
It's true

61
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,600
that she has

62
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,270
quite a temper,

63
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,090
always hitting and kicking me
for no reason,

64
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,920
but...

65
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,120
but she's

66
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
really wonderful

67
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,740
and very kind.

68
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,870
I really like her.

69
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,870
Sorry about that.

70
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,760
You're such a go-getter.

71
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,870
Don't worry.

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,270
Count on me.

73
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,130
You have a plan?

74
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
What strong legs!

75
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,690
What are you doing?

76
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,700
There are rain,

77
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,920
grass,

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,120
flowers,

79
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,190
and sheep;

80
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,800
delightful.

81
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,770
Miss, you know,

82
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,150
I've recently

83
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,909
fallen in love with reading.

84
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,900
Are you sick in the head?

85
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,970
What do you need?

86
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,650
No, nothing.

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,420
Your practice is more important.

88
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,210
Go on.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,760
Switching on and off;

90
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,560
darting in the river;

91
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,790
my fair maiden;

92
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,070
your gentleman...

93
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,420
Your gentleman...

94
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
What nonsense are you reciting?

95
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,710
This is a poem I wrote for you.

96
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,700
Do you like it?

97
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,680
A poem?

98
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,120
Yes.

99
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,630
Then tell me

100
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
what this poem

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,510
is supposed to mean.

102
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,680
What it means?

103
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,250
What it means is...

104
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,720
It means

105
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,200
I'm...

106
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,580
i-inviting you to a river stroll

107
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,440
and then a meal together.

108
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
What kind of meal?

109
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,750
Gentle meat and mushroom stew.

110
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,750
Didn't I just mention it?

111
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,750
Plus a pot of wine.

112
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,430
A hearty meal of meat and wine,

113
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,490
now that's heaven.

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
Here you go.

115
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,150
Yes.

116
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,169
Come on,

117
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,390
you too.

118
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,030
Time for your medicine.

119
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,810
Time for your medicine.

120
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,870
Seriously? You're always

121
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,330
making me drink medicine.

122
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,750
Even my hiccups smell like medicine now.

123
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
The last dose.

124
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,830
You said the same thing yesterday.

125
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,440
It seems this medicine
really works wonders.

126
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Just a few days and you already

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
have the energy to talk back.

128
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,000
You're recovering better and better,

129
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,630
and I no longer experience
any strange symptoms.

130
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,490
Seems you won't

131
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,410
have to suffer from
the backlash anymore.

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,460
This trip to Cang Mountain

133
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,040
has truly been worthwhile.

134
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,200
There's fresh osmanthus cake
at the market.

135
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
They're really good.

136
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,150
Once you finish this,

137
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,280
I'll take you there.

138
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,270
No!

139
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,960
Just one sip.

140
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,320
Nope.

141
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,350
Come on. Just one sip.

142
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,650
Half a sip?

143
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,780
Come on now.

144
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,160
I-I'll drink it myself.

145
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,380
When I was sick,

146
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,590
you took care of me like this.

147
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Now, it's my turn.

148
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,220
Here.

149
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,030
Did you...

150
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,030
add honey?

151
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,920
Not so bitter, is it?

152
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,730
By the way,

153
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,390
we've been so busy in battle

154
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,200
that I hadn't thought about this,

155
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,480
but the man who held me hostage
at the hot springs

156
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,120
was desperate to draw you out.

157
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,150
Perhaps he's connected to
whomever caused your memory loss.

158
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,000
If we find him,

159
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,310
all our problems could be solved.

160
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,290
But that person is so elusive.

161
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,410
If he doesn't show up voluntarily,

162
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,750
we have

163
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,750
no way to track him down.

164
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,480
I remember what he looks like.

165
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,320
People can search for him

166
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,250
with a portrait.

167
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,480
Since he failed,

168
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,610
he wouldn't have gone far.

169
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,200
Then it's settled.

170
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,480
Go get some paper and brushes,

171
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,880
and I'll do the painting.

172
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,750
Meet me

173
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,830
by the stream.

174
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,230
Have you ever heard of Wuling Mountain?

175
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,750
Nope.

176
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,320
Lu Xin told me

177
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,630
there are geniuses there
adept at using unusual methods

178
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,830
with healing stones.

179
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,510
In this world,

180
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,150
perhaps only they can effect

181
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,000
such changes in humans.

182
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,670
If we locate this place,

183
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,360
would I be able to

184
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,030
get leads about my origins?

185
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,410
I've sent people to locate it,

186
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,250
but it might take some time.

187
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,200
Knowing my origins would be good.

188
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,730
I'd feel more whole

189
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,840
to know I have roots.

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,730
It'd also give me some closure.

191
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,560
But it's fine if we find nothing either.

192
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,890
Because no matter who I am,

193
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,870
I prefer being Jin'an.

194
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,860
When you retire,

195
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,910
let's find

196
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,530
an idyllic abode away from the world,

197
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,140
enjoying every day

198
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,530
drinking wine,

199
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,880
practicing swordplay,

200
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,690
and ignoring worldly affairs in peace.

201
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,040
Who said I want to spend my life with you?

202
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,600
Ouyang Jun has many friends
among the outlaws.

203
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,320
Get him to seek him out

204
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,450
with this portrait.

205
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,850
What's this smell?

206
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,750
Seek...

207
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,470
Go on.

208
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,120
Seeking him out

209
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,880
with this painting of yours...

210
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,440
What's wrong with my painting?

211
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,300
I've never been good at painting.

212
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,140
It's more or else accurate.
That's good enough.

213
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,810
You do it if you're so capable.

214
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
I'll give it a go then.

215
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,480
Jin'an really has a way with her.

216
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,120
When Shuang gets angry,

217
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,720
she usually draws her sword,

218
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,960
but now she's actually being coy.

219
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,550
That rascal Jin'an is always

220
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,570
clinging to General.

221
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,630
Who knows what he's really scheming.

222
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
Isn't it obvious?

223
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,750
They're clearly in love with each other.

224
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,000
What a perfect match.

225
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,880
Ridiculous!

226
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,390
General is extraordinary and worldly.

227
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,360
She wouldn't fall for
this weak, pretty boy's

228
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,160
cheap tricks.

229
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,030
If you ask me,

230
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
only that righteous masked hero

231
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,960
barely qualifies

232
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,380
to be with our general.

233
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,390
Choosing a lifetime partner

234
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,200
isn't picking soldiers for battle.

235
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,480
You should pick one

236
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
with a pretty face

237
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,270
and a sweet tongue

238
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,520
to keep by your side.

239
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,910
Your future days

240
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,850
will be much more enjoyable.

241
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,390
The man in black is incredibly strong

242
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,520
and admired by many.

243
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm very strong too.

244
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,720
That man in black...

245
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,240
Where is he?

246
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,750
That man in black

247
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,600
always appears with
a mask over his face.

248
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,150
He could be

249
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
super ugly with pockmarks all over.

250
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,370
But handsome men are never reliable.

251
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,610
Nonsense!

252
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,630
Anyway,

253
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,280
I know Shuang best.

254
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,670
If you don't believe me,

255
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,720
want to make a bet?

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,150
If Jin'an wins,

257
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,550
you'll have to

258
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,670
grind 15 kg of herbs for me.

259
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,030
Deal.

260
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,260
If the man in black wins,

261
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,750
I want the biggest sword

262
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,520
from Wang's Blacksmith.

263
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,330
It's a deal.

264
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,830
Your painting is...

265
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,870
quite decent,

266
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,240
but compared to mine,

267
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
it's not much better.

268
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,600
You're right, General.

269
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,550
Various painting styles have been
recorded in history.

270
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,160
Your painting and mine are

271
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,290
just of different styles.

272
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,590
Your painting is...

273
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,990
exceptionally wild.

274
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,480
Are you mocking me?

275
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,220
What a strong push!

276
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,000
Sorry,

277
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,070
I keep assuming you are
as formidable as the man in black.

278
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,830
I forgot that you're a weak kitten now.

279
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,680
Am I really

280
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,960
that inferior to him?

281
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,610
Yes.

282
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,880
Don't go!

283
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,640
Did I say anything wrong?

284
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,700
Enjoying the smell of pickles?

285
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,490
Nice to run into you!

286
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,350
It smells good and tastes good.

287
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,880
Try some.

288
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,240
Weren't you two just making a bet?

289
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,110
I want in too.

290
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,970
All-in on Jin'an!

291
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,750
Just like me!

292
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,220
Impulsive people sure are big spenders.

293
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,930
Ouyang Jun.

294
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,200
Lady Li.

295
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,110
Make copies of this

296
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,750
and distribute them to your buddies.

297
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,950
Seek this person out.

298
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:23,960
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,560
Remember,

300
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,310
this mystery man's unbelievably skilled.

301
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,200
Don't confront him head-on.

302
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,190
Safety comes first.

303
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,850
Yes, ma'am.

304
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,640
Lu Xin.

305
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,760
Don't you find the pickles smelly?

306
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,160
Not at all!

307
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,480
I like it as much as the flies.

308
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,720
Alright.

309
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,790
Master.

310
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,380
I just received news

311
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,000
that a team has secretly
departed from Yao State,

312
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,550
apparently sent by Zuo Chengzhi

313
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,990
to search for Prince Annan.

314
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,310
If the shadow puppet's identity
is exposed,

315
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,510
it'll be disastrous.

316
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,440
Should we make our move now?

317
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,240
If we kill this team,

318
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,400
they'll just send more people.

319
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,190
Then what do you suggest?

320
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,240
They've reached Taijin's border,

321
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,140
so they won't dare
cause too much commotion.

322
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,960
Keep an eye on them secretly.

323
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,530
When we find out
who they're in contact with,

324
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,750
we'll strike.

325
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,110
Understood.

326
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,680
Master.

327
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,480
The shadow puppet is formidable
to begin with.

328
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,040
Even if punishment is necessary,

329
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,970
the Empress Dowager's methods
seem far too extreme.

330
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,110
You may go.

331
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,440
Yes, sir.

332
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

333
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,880
Does Your Majesty remember

334
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,030
that today is my birthday?

335
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,750
Where is Aodeng?

336
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,320
What have you done to him?

337
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,160
Your Majesty is being difficult again,

338
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,790
always bringing up

339
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
people who aren't relevant.

340
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,200
I risked my life to save Your Majesty,

341
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,160
only to be with you

342
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,880
as equals in marriage

343
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,140
and share our lives together.

344
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,110
But Your Majesty

345
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,800
only thinks about your brother.

346
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,160
Doesn't that make

347
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,560
all my efforts in vain?

348
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,000
I suppose for the next three days,

349
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,420
Your Majesty won't even need
to drink water.

350
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,140
[Cangyun Pavilion]

351
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,480
So?

352
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Recall anything?

353
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,000
I told you

354
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,090
this condition isn't easy to cure.

355
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,920
No matter how eager you are,

356
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,880
you can't go against medical principles.

357
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,680
This won't do.

358
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,640
Again!

359
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,720
Again?

360
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,210
You think this is a game?

361
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,000
Honestly,

362
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,790
why are you suddenly

363
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,110
so impatient to recover your memory?

364
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,910
Oh, please, it's as clear as day.

365
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,000
During the battle at Lucheng,

366
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,070
you stormed the tower alone
and captured Li Zhangyi

367
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,160
so impressively.

368
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,570
But who would've thought

369
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,550
a mysterious man in black would appear

370
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,440
and fight alongside Shuang,

371
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,440
totally stealing your thunder.

372
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,680
If it were me, I'd be anxious too.

373
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,660
Am I really that petty?

374
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,880
You think he's better than me too?

375
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,430
What I think doesn't matter.

376
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,430
What matters is what Shuang thinks.

377
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,430
You only came to me

378
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,880
because you're worried
you're not worthy of Shuang

379
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,400
with your memory loss, right?

380
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,310
But what if

381
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,000
you recall everything

382
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,410
and realize that

383
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,030
you're just average?

384
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,110
I'd rather be average,

385
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,070
as long as I know who I am.

386
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,120
By the way,

387
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,750
Shuang told me...

388
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,240
Who?

389
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,100
You told her...

390
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:57,830
By the way,

391
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,880
General told me

392
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,570
that you told her about Wuling Mountain.

393
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,930
What else do you know?

394
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,070
I only know rumors.

395
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,400
People talk about that place
as if it's magical,

396
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,860
but no one has ever seen it.

397
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,110
Maybe it doesn't even exist.

398
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,790
So everything you told me was a lie,

399
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,640
including your promise

400
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,510
to cure me?

401
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,440
You can doubt my medical skills,

402
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,960
but don't question my medical ethics!

403
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,880
This is

404
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,750
my latest concoction,

405
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,480
specifically for amnesia.

406
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,540
It's not identical

407
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,980
to your condition,

408
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,880
but it might still be of use.

409
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,420
If you've got the guts,

410
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,590
give it a try.

411
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,510
I've tried everything else.

412
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,570
This won't kill me!

413
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,720
How do you feel?

414
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,000
My mouth feels numb.

415
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,640
Numb mouth...

416
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,270
My chest feels warm.

417
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,710
Warm chest...

418
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,830
My face is a bit itchy.

419
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,360
Itchy face...

420
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,750
And...

421
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I think that's it.

422
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,720
I hope that's it

423
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,280
for the side effects.

424
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,400
No, let me check again.

425
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,240
Medicine

426
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,270
needs time to take effect.

427
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,700
I'm suddenly so tired.

428
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,940
I'm going for a nap.

429
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,400
If you need anything,

430
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,750
don't bother calling me.

431
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,810
Alright, go ahead.

432
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,350
Jin'an.

433
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,960
Jin'an!

434
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
The food is ready.

435
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,660
What are you doing?

436
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm...

437
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,430
not eating. You all go ahead.

438
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,440
Are you not feeling well?

439
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Let me take a look.

440
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,480
No!

441
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,950
I've caught a cold.

442
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,120
What's with the blanket?

443
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,060
I don't want to pass it to you.

444
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,200
Oh, please, I take tonics every day.

445
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,590
A mere cold is nothing to me.

446
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,110
Let me see.

447
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,590
No.

448
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,520
-Let me see!
-No!

449
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,520
Go eat dinner.

450
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,930
I know my limits.

451
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,360
I won't neglect myself.

452
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,280
Fine then.

453
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,830
In that case,

454
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,540
you should rest up.

455
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,610
You got me worried for nothing.

456
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,350
I'm used to seeing you
clean-shaven and fresh,

457
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,680
but this rugged look

458
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,960
actually

459
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,510
has its own charm.

460
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,030
I asked Lu Xin for help

461
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,900
to speed up my memory recovery

462
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,040
and for info on Wuling Mountain.

463
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,270
But after taking her medicine,

464
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,400
I ended up like this.

465
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,050
What's wrong with this?

466
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,920
Now, you look

467
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,350
quite manly.

468
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,360
I think it really suits you.

469
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,600
So you do prefer masculine men.

470
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,240
Like...

471
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,470
the man in black.

472
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,570
You don't have a fever.

473
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,590
Mister,

474
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,560
aren't you the man in black?

475
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,790
Right.

476
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,270
But also not.

477
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,240
You don't get it.

478
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,990
What's not to get?

479
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,680
Come, follow me.

480
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,810
Go have dinner. Don't worry about me.

481
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,160
I can ignore the man in black,

482
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,200
but not you.

483
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,400
It's just a bit of a beard.

484
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,790
At worst,

485
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,750
I'll shave it for you.

486
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,030
You will?

487
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,690
A freshly-sharpened blade,

488
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,770
sharper than a tiger's fangs.

489
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,370
Dear lord.

490
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,610
I've been saying I'd teach you,

491
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,590
but things kept getting in the way.

492
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,270
Now,

493
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,480
while we're out sightseeing,

494
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,340
let's catch up on all the missed lessons.

495
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,680
Taking lessons while sightseeing

496
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,880
doesn't sound right.

497
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
Doesn't sound right?

498
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,640
You really think so?

499
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,640
Fine.

500
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,350
Today,

501
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,510
we'll start with something useful.

502
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,510
Was this...

503
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,780
painted by you?

504
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,720
May the bright clouds and moon

505
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,350
carry my longing to my dear ones far away.

506
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,110
I didn't expect you
to have such good handwriting.

507
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,200
Who knows? Perhaps I was

508
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,790
a somewhat educated teacher before.

509
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,680
Look,

510
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,270
your handwriting

511
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,590
is strong and powerful,

512
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,750
bold and heroic.

513
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,350
As they say, your handwriting
reflects who you are.

514
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,350
I believe you must

515
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,470
have an extraordinary background.

516
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,960
If I'm not mistaken,

517
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,430
this must be the Double Dragons Formation
from The Art of War.

518
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,700
As they say, warfare is
the art of deception.

519
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,960
My forces are now moving to surround you,

520
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,590
so be careful.

521
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,490
As they say,
the student surpasses the master.

522
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,100
Passable.

523
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,300
Anything else?

524
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,190
Stop!

525
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,970
What kind of technique is that?

526
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,670
Buddy, you don't know this,

527
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,000
but martial artists

528
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,920
prefer to be spontaneous.

529
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,820
Spontaneous, indeed.

530
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,960
But

531
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,350
the guqin

532
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,510
has its own rules.

533
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,590
Sit properly.

534
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,920
Hands in position.

535
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,940
Curl your fingers.

536
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,790
Good.

537
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,130
Let's begin.

538
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,570
Oh, my mighty general,

539
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,310
your music pierces the ears.

540
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,270
Perhaps it could drive away enemies
on the battlefield.

541
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:22,960
Stop!

542
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,690
Take a break.

543
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,310
Must you

544
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,640
be that harsh?

545
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,640
Our Shuang's music

546
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,880
may not be as sublime as the classics

547
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,640
or very aesthetically pleasing,

548
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,160
but

549
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,040
it's at the very least
music that lingers.

550
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
How is it noise

551
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,990
to repel enemies?

552
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,630
What a flirt.

553
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,440
If that's the case,

554
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,590
I'll play another piece.

isn't just spices.

You're straightforward, Mr. Zang.

559
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,390
Since we're asking for help,

560
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,310
there's no point in hiding our intentions.

561

Who?

564

You have extensive connections
and access to information.

565
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,110
Please help us find someone.

566
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,180
Have you seen this person?

567
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,320
Though you two are disguised as merchants,

571

Ninglan has always been
a neutral territory.

Today's battle has just ended,

573

and Taijin hasn't withdrawn
its forces yet.

Those who need to sneak into the city now

575
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,150
are probably

576
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,360

You're really perceptive, Mr. Zang.

578

No wonder nothing
in the cities beyond the border

579

escapes you.

580
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,550
We'll have to trouble you

581
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,330
to locate this person.

582

These today are

583
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,530
just a down payment.

If you find any leads,

585
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,040
I guarantee the reward

586
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,070
will be no less than threefold.

worth millions of taels,

and in command of Yao Army

597
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,480
such that the Yao soldiers
travel all the way

598
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,480
from the Yao State border to Ninglan
in search of him

599
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,280
can only be Prince Annan, Duan Aodeng!

600
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,250
Since you've already figured it out,

601
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,590
you must understand
the weight of this matter.

602
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,440
Will you

603
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,390
help me with this

604
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,140
or not?

605
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,710
If I fail,

606
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,210
I'll take triple the treasure.

607

But if I succeed,

608
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,150
I fear I won't be able to
stay in Ninglan anymore.

609
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,000
Then I'll have to become
an official in the Yao State,

It's a deal.

Deliver this letter secretly into Lucheng

615
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,150
and hand it to General Li Shuang
personally.

616
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,440
You must tell her

617
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,080
that the person she found is

618
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,340
none other than Duan Aodeng,
Prince Annan of the Yao State.

619
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,200
Didn't you just make a deal with
those Yao soldiers?

620
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,920
That was just a delaying tactic.

621

In the previous battle,

the Yao people entered the city
and slaughtered our civilians.

Fortunately, General Li kept her promise

00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,920
No one knows.

694
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,150
Also,

695
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,240
a tragic incident has occurred
in Ninglan City.

696
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,970
It seems to be his doing as well.

697
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
This matter sounds suspicious.

698
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,850
It must be related to the Jade Linglong.

699
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,880
I guess

700
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,800
I'll have to make a trip there.
