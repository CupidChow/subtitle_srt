4
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,920
As expected, you still want to stay in the palace.

5
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,970
Are you here to convince me not to?

6
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,990
I can't change Master's mind,

7
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,410
but I trust

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,260
you're just unable to disobey your master's order.

9
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,770
I can only help you as much as possible.

10
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,970
Thank you, Lord Yang.

11
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,080
That will suffice.

12
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
Do you really know magic?

13
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,329
Of course not.

14
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,780
How did you know about the rain in Yuzhou?

15
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,579
This news

16
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,310
was only delivered today.

17
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,660
I was just lucky.

18
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,570
I went to buy some vegetables before entering the palace that day.

19
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,140
I happened to meet a vegetable farmer.

20
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,000
He told me that there's heavy mist in the mountains.

21
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,540
The north wind started up,

22
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,540
so the mist would float to Yuzhou.

23
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,670
When this kind of weather occurs in the winter,

24
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,070
it will definitely rain.

25
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,410
An important figure like you

26
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,760
still cares for the commoners.

27
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,520
I admire you.

28
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,270
What important figure?

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,730
We still need to eat vegetables and porridge.

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,880
By the way, Lord Yang,

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,650
later,

32
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,300
you must do me a favor.

33
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,400
What is it?

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,510
Eunuch Wang.

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,120
Imperial Preceptor.

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,680
What is this place?

37
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,840
It's just a wasteland that has been abandoned for 100 years.

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,010
Let's go on.

39
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait.

40
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,990
I think this place has great feng shui.

41
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,530
It has the potential to be the site of a pagoda.

42
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,390
This place...

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,760
It's a place of bad luck in the palace.

44
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,100
Imperial Preceptor, are you mistaken?

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,820
No.

46
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,180
This place is just deserted,

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,760
but there are treasures hidden throughout.

48
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,420
Well, Imperial Preceptor,

49
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,950
I am speaking the truth.

50
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,540
This was where the late Empress Dowager Kang Xian lived.

51
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,100
Later, many servants went missing.

52
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,430
Only their mangled corpse could be found.

53
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,070
Someone also saw...

54
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,980
Saw what?

55
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,610
A monster with two heads,

56
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,890
the fabled beast, Ni Tianhou.

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,079
As time went by, this place became deserted.

58
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,730
Even the night patrol guards avoid this place.

59
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,660
It's indeed a place of evil.

The same goes for the auspicious places.

When the pagoda is created,

65
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,750
the feng shui can be changed.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,040
This will become the most auspicious place in the palace.

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,260
The four of you from the Ministry of Industry,

68
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,300
take a look here.

69
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,980
See which area's soil is suitable for building a pagoda.

70

Yes.

Imperial Preceptor,

72
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,140
you must be thirsty after walking all this way.

73
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,650
Here,

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,850

Your Sky-covering Palm is extraordinary.

76

But

77
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,050
it's impolite to steal my instrument.

78
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,160
Lord Yang was afraid

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,960
that the water would stain your instrument.

80
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,600
So, he wanted to hold it steadily for you.

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,370
You might give yourself away

83
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,250
and get kicked out of the palace.

84
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,110
All your efforts would be in vain.

85

Next...

Aren't we looking for the child bugs?

102
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,020
the child bugs were there.

103
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,350
They should be dead now.

Snow salt is so precious.

How did you get it?

109
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,820
It's just a coincidental gift from an old friend.

the four men from the Ministry of Industry?

113
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,320
They seemed a bit timid,

but there's nothing special about them.

115

Yes.

Those four craftsmen

117
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,830
only listened to the demon monk's orders.

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,490
The child bugs probably

119
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,220
helped the Demon Monk find that abandoned garden.

120
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,140
It means that the mother bug is nearby.

121
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,140
But the Demon Monk

122
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,800
wanted the four craftsmen to search for him.

123
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,480
He probably

124
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,700
only confirmed this general direction.

125
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,260
So,

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,720
but they insisted

176
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,620
they found it from a corpse in the wasteland.

177
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,870
When the Imperial City Division went to investigate,

178
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,570
they indeed found a corpse.

179
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,300
Its body was broken and limbs were incomplete.

180
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,060
It couldn't have been caused by humans.

181
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,100
It was more like a tiger or wolf that caused it,

182
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,020
but the Beast Garden is outside the palace.

183
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,620
How could wild beasts come to the inner palace?

184
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,190
There were indeed treasures around the body.

185
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,920
Their testimonies became credible.

186
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,340
Was the one who died also a palace eunuch?

187
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,480
Yes.

188
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,210
In that case,

189
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,550
I think the five committed theft together,

190
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,140
and killed one due to the uneven distribution of spoils.

191
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,120
Master suspected that as well,

192
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,060
but the treasures found were not in this dynasty's style.

193
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,860
Rather, they were from 100 years ago.

194
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,200
When treasures in the palace were checked,

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,730
nothing was found missing.

196
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,620
Without any evidence,

197
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,020
they could only kick them out of the palace.

198
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,700
Treasures from 100 years ago

199
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,900
suddenly appeared

200
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,580
next to a corpse.

201
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,350
Don't you think that's strange?

202
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,760
Do you know where exactly

203
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,450
the treasures came from?

204
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,880
It's hard to trace the gold and silver,

205
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,240
but there was a jade Buddha statue

206
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,370
received by Emperor Guangqing as tribute 100 years ago.

207
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,130
It is said to be worshiped in the Pagoda of Bliss.

208
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,710
The Pagoda of Bliss?

209
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,740
I heard from Empress Dowager that

210
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,900
Emperor Guangqing built it to pray for a son,

211
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,580
but His Majesty said it’s not true.

212
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
It's just a rumor.

213
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,980
Does the Pagoda of Bliss

214
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,090
really exist or not?

215
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,820
According to the old people in the palace,

216
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,240
Emperor Guangqing had no children back then.

217
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,300
Later, the Pagoda of Bliss was built.

218
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,010
Consort Ying soon became pregnant with a prince and became the empress.

219
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,850
But somehow,

220
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,730
the Pagoda of Bliss vanished overnight.

221
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,210
Vanished?

222
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,080
Yes.

223
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,480
In one night,

224
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,790
not a single piece of tile remained

225
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,510
where the pagoda originally stood.

226
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,480
The Pagoda of Bliss?

227
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,180
The Pagoda of Bliss is missing!

228
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,790
The Pagoda of Bliss is gone!

229
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,600
The palace forbade it from being mentioned afterward.

230
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,730
It became a mystery.

231
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,570
Legend has it that this pagoda contained heavenly fortune.

232
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,010
After the fortune was exchanged for a prince,

233
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,870
the heavens took the pagoda back.

234
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,270
But everyone in the palace

235
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,190
knew the pagoda had been built.

236
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,570
There must be clues left behind.

237
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,640
There is no record in the palace.

238
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,520
However,

239
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,930
back then,

240
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,720
I found a draft of a pagoda

241
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,180
in the hands of Eunuch Wu, who served Emperor Guangqing.

242
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,570
Eunuch Wu loved poetry.

243
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,090
The picture was inside a book.

244
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,180
But...

245
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,630
I don't know if it's the Pagoda of Bliss.

246
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:14,790
Look.

247
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,040
The Pagoda of Bliss.

248
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,540
The mother bug is hidden in the missing pagoda.

249
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,320
Why did Shan Gudao search for these four eunuchs?

250
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,260
Because these four eunuchs

251
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,870
had gone to the Pagoda of Bliss.

252
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
We can't escape.

253
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,820
How about we tell them?

254
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,240
You're not afraid of dying?

255
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,310
It can't follow us forever.

256
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,250
Monster!

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,630
Help! There's a monster!

258
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,820
Monster!

259
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,460
Ghost!

260
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,320
What monster?

261
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,760
Ni Tianhou appeared again!

262
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,580
Don't kill me!

263
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,650
I didn't say anything.

264
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,970
I didn't say anything.

265
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,520
What did you say?

266
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,140
Who is trying to kill you?

267
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,970
These men said Ni Tianhou is back.

268
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,640
Have you

269
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,950
seen this monster before?

270
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,040
Before, we...

271
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,640
Before...

272
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,150
Shut up!

273
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,580
Sect Leader Shan, you came just in time.

274
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,020
Junior,

275
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,260
you tried so hard to get them to speak,

276
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,130
but you can't get anything out, can you?

277
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,820
Oh, you.

278
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,850
You always do futile things.

279
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,210
The style of this robe

280
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,950
is from the imperial family 100 years ago.

281
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,810
No one wears it anymore.

282
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,910
A hundred years ago?

283
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,900
Is it really a ghost?

284
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,050
The design is old,

285
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,420
but the fabric is new.

286
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,120
This robe contains

287
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,940
a putrid smell.

288
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,510
It must be the smell of beast blood.

289
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,350
It seems

290
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,350
someone is playing tricks behind the scenes.

291
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,400
It's the Wansheng Clan again.

292
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,760
What I don’t understand is

293
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,910
the Wansheng Clan found these four people

294
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,770
to search for the Pagoda of Bliss.

295
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,940
But then,

296
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,590
why would they cause a commotion?

297
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,590
Shan Gudao said I tried my best to get words out of them.

298
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,470
He must think

299
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,480
that I'm behind this bloody robe and beast.

300
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,600
It seems there's a third person behind this.

301
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,500
Who is he?

302
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,740
Why did he do this?

303
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,710
It was Li Lianhua.

304
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,700
He deliberately splashed water in the daytime

305
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,430
but actually froze the child bugs with snow salt.

306
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,950
Now he got a bloody robe.

307
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,470
We can't get rid of him.

308
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,820
He's very difficult to deal with.

309
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Should I kill him?

310
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,400
-No.
-Don’t ruin the plan.

311
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,010
We can't kill him now.

312
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,030
He showed his face to the emperor.

313
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,150
If we kill him now,

314
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,550
we'll alert the enemy.

315
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,900
He is no longer the Li Xiangyi

316
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,020
who commanded the martial arts world before.

317
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,780
Where did he

318
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,650
get this expensive snow salt?

319
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,400
We haven't found the mother bug,

320
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,580
but the child bugs died.

321
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,290
Those four idiots don't dare to tell us

322
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,530
where the entrance was.

323
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,390
How do we find the Pagoda of Bliss?

324
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,430
We'll use some means to force them to speak tomorrow.

325
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,300
We can't wait any longer.

326
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,900
[White Jade Academy]

327
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,520
[East Hall]

328
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,690
What?

329
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,400
You still can't tell which area is the best?

330
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,270
Well,

331
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,180
we need to look further.

332
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,100
We need to check more carefully.

333
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,340
Eunuch Wang,

334
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,370
to prevent evil disturbances when the soil is moved,

335
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,460
put these black-iron flags in the corners of the abandoned palace

336
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,180
to suppress the evil spirits.

337
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,220
That's great.

338
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,180
Let's go.

339
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,580
Since I brought you all in the imperial city,

340
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,000
it means I know everything about you all.

341
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,980
Starting today, I will kill

342
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,060
one of your family members

343
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,100
each day

344
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,790
until you speak.

345
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,210
Please spare us.

346
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,400
There really is a monster!

347
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,460
People will die if we speak nonsense.

348
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,780
If you tell the truth,

349
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,540
you will die.

350
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,079
If you don't tell me,

351
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,660
both you and your family will die.

352
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,260
Lu Fang,

353
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,740
you still have

354
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,339
an 80-year-old mother waiting for you at home.

355
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:27,940
I...

356
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,140
Do you want her to die?

357
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,069
How do you want her to die?

358
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,940
Beheaded,

359
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,960
drowned in the river,

360
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,060
or dismembered?

361
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,580
Tell me.

362
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,130
Don't kill me.

363
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
I know nothing.

364
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:40,900
Spare me!

365
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,140
Ni Tianhou eats people who steal from the Pagoda of Bliss.

366
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,370
Where else do you want to escape to?

367
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,180
I entered the Pagoda of Bliss with the others.

368
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,070
I am not the main culprit.

369
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,850
Don't kill me.

370
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,900
-Don't kill me!
-Where is the Pagoda of Bliss?

371
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,370
It's...

372
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,580
Physician Li.

373
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,320
What happened?

374
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,810
Physician Li,

375
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,070
didn't you get sick?

376
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,370
Why are you here again?

377
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,700
I gave myself some medicine.

378
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,380
I'm much better now.

379
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,990
Thank you for helping me request for leave.

380
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,250
You don't care about your health,

381
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,690
but you always trouble yourself.

382
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,740
Thank you for your concern.

383
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,160
It's troublesome recently.

384
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,280
My opponents are always

385
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,460
those who've become well-known decades ago.

386
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,520
Crazy Knife, Fatal Five Fists, and Bone-gnawing Spear

387
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,790
are each more difficult than the last.

388
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,780
Who's next?

389
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,480
I'll continue to accept the duel.

390
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,500
Xiangyi Swordplay.

391
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,970
This is the sword of Li Xiangyi’s Master.

392
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,540
I have to go against Li Xiangyi's master.

393
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,620
You will never win

394
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,890
this final battle.

395
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,060
No.

396
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,240
I can't get through this.

397
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,150
Give up.

398
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,650
I'm not Li Xiangyi.

399
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,920
I can't defeat Qi Mushan.

400
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,860
There will always be a new legend.

401
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,630
Maybe

402
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,140
you'll be the next new legend.

403
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,300
The Xiangyi Swordplay and Yangzhouman are compatible.

404
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,220
The internal energy forms the structure of the sword technique.

405
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,830
The sword technique is the soul of the internal energy.

406
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,980
Li Xiangyi's martial arts had accumulated

407
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,430
since childhood.

408
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,310
That's why his body and soul were unified

409
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,490
and he could move freely

410
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,700
to defeat his master.

411
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,360
What about me?

412
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,630
Where is Shan Gudao?

413
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,890
Take him down!

414
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,930
What kind of martial arts is this?

415
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,100
The newly created Mr. Worried's Swordplay.

416
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,780
Let me ask you again.

417
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,390
Where is Shan Gudao?

418
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,630
I don't know.

419
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,460
Master...

420
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,870
Master is in the palace.

421
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,500
He went to the palace too?

422
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,310
Li Lianhua...

423
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,480
[Palace]

424
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,470
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

425
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,220
[Harmonious Breeze]

426
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,660
[Together]

427
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,170
Sect Leader Li.

428
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,220
Thank you.

429
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,950
I didn't expect Shan Gudao to be so skilled.

430
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,590
If he hadn't restrained himself in the palace this morning,

431
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,850
he would've caught us.

432
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,840
How is it?

433
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,830
Did you get anything today?

434
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,920
Did the four of them not return?

435
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,080
Didn't they leave the palace with you?

436
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,390
The craftsmen had to do roll-call with the Ministry of Industry,

437
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,720
so they were taken away.

438
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,230
It seems that Shan Gudao

439
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,710
wanted to hide these four people.

440
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,380
Lord Yang,

441
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,540
does the Ministry of Industry have a special station in the inner palace?

442
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,880
The inner palace is for the imperial family.

443
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,280
How could the Ministry of Industry be here?

444
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,390
However, there is a Shanyi Workshop

445
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,290
where various materials are stored,

446
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,220
but it's not a place for people to live in.

447
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,280
These people were planted by the Ministry of Industry.

448
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,980
They must be hidden in the Shanyi Workshop.

449
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,500
I don't think Shan Gudao can wait any longer.

450
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,420
That's why he's doing everything he can

451
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,690
to find the whereabouts of the Pagoda of Bliss.

452
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,350
I must be one step ahead of him.

453
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,380
Who are you?

454
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,140
I wish to see Dian Qiu, Imperial Guard Commander.

455
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,660
I am Dian Qiu.

456
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,780
You are?

457
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,260
I can only bring you to the palace,

458
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,420
but I can't guarantee you can walk around freely.

459
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,660
There are many hidden guards in the palace.

460
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,420
Be careful.

461
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,180
Don't worry.

462
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,320
Even if I get caught,

463
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,920
I'll say I climbed over the wall by myself.

464
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,410
Thank you.

465
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,360
Monster.

466
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,590
Let's tell them.

467
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,120
Monster.

468
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,910
We should have spoken earlier.

469
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,900
If we spoke when we recognized that osmanthus tree on the first day,

470
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,460
we might be on our way back now.

471
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,100
Even if we did,

472
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,510
will the monster let us go?

473
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,300
Don't forget,

474
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,220
we witnessed

475
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,950
how Xue Kuan was torn into pieces by that monster.

476
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,490
Don't mention Xue Kuan.

477
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,430
He accidentally

478
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,890
found the Pagoda of Bliss when he was drunk.

479
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,720
Just because he coveted the treasures inside,

480
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,810
he incited us to transport the treasures together.

481
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,180
That's why we went there.

482
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,240
But we only transported a few pieces,

483
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,540
went in and out a few times,

484
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,500
and we saw

485
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,320
he was bitten to death by the monster.

486
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,380
That robe floated

487
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,190
behind that monster.

488
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,870
A voice also threatened us

489
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,670
not to leak the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss.

490
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,000
We've kept our mouth shut for so many years

491
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,420
and we've been safe.

492
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,850
Look.

493
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,550
The monster appeared

494
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,140
as soon as we got here.

495
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,740
Let's not talk about it.

496
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,940
Most of the treasures

497
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,970
were taken away by the Imperial City Division.

498
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,430
We only hid a few pieces and brought them out.

499
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,630
All these years, we never dared to sell them.

500
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,040
I only sold one,

501
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,070
and someone found out and brought us here.

502
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,130
It's all my fault.

503
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,560
Let's tell him.

504
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,810
But what about the monster?

505
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,840
Although it's scary,

506
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,260
it will only kill us.

507
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,980
But the Wansheng Clan

508
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,780
can do anything.

509
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,530
For the safety of our family,

510
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,810
we can sacrifice our lives.

511
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,950
It's worth it.

512
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,900
Now that you mention it,

513
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,850

I heard Shan Gudao came to the imperial city.

I'm afraid it's for the mother bug too.

He thinks Shan Gudao set you up,

but I don't think so.

591
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,840
If Shan Gudao killed the person he brought in

592
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,800
and caused a lot of trouble in the palace,

593
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,700
it won't help him find the mother bug.

594
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,940
There must be a third person behind this.

595

Before Li Fei died,

602

he drew a circle on the table.

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,370
I thought about it for a long time but couldn't figure it out.

604

But now I finally know

605
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,980
what this circle means.

606
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,280

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,180
the entrance to the Pagoda of Bliss

610
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,610
might be near a well.

611

But if such a pagoda

612
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,150
is still in the palace,

613
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,700
someone would have discovered it.

614
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,390
I haven't figured it out yet.

615

But the only thing we know is

616
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,200
the four were killed

617
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,920
and Shan Gudao has lost the clue to the pagoda.

618

The third person behind this

619
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,250
stops others from searching for the Pagoda of Bliss,

620
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,060
so he must know all the clues.

621
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,680
So,

622
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,990
our goal now is to find

623
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,220
this third person.

624

It's not forged.

626
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,980
I've read the corpse report of these four.

627
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,420
Their throats were bitten through

628
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,850
and their abdomens dug open by claws.

629

They were indeed killed by a beast.

630
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,210

631
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,750
the blood on the ground doesn't look right.

632

is splattered around the bodies.

There are no smudges,

635

which means none of them tried to escape.

636

There were four of them.

They had a chance to escape.

639

Why didn't they escape,

640
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,780
instead of letting the beast kill them?

641

No poison?

643
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,650
It doesn't make sense if there's no poison.

685
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,100
to be two lynxes tied together.

686
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,980
That's why it's so cruel.

687
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,200
Let's go in and have a look.

688
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,560
Seeing this,

689
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,900
it makes sense now.

690
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,770
There are so many lynx remains in the cave.

691
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,460
It seems the murderer has been playing tricks

692
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,330
for many years.

693
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,830
The missing maids and eunuchs

694
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,130
must have been killed by the murderer

695
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,060
for approaching the Pagoda of Bliss.

696
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,920
Think about it.

697
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,360
He just used the lynxes to kill someone.

698
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,480
He won't come here

699
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,960
for a while.

700
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,100
In that case,

701
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,820
we need to find a way

702
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,450
to find out who he is.

703
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,140
The corpses of animals in the cave

704
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,030
are usually fed to the lynxes.

705
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,610
The inner palace is strict.

706
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,420
It's hard not to attract attention

707
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,980
when sending large batches of meat here every few days.

708
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,040
This fake mountain

709
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,940
is built by the palace wall.

710
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,120
The small door in the cave can lead to the outer palace,

711
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,330
so he can put food in from the outside.

712
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,700
But even outside,

713
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,140
there's someone watching this place.

714
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,230
All supplies coming in and out are recorded.

715
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,860
It's hard for him to succeed by transporting or stealing.

716
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,620
Thus,

717
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,240
he can steal food from a group that can't speak.

718
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,460
I see.

719
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
The Beast Garden?

720
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,660
That's right.

721
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,870
Let's go.

722
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,640
Uncle Qian,

723
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,500
long time no see.

724
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,730
Fang,

725
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,480
long time no see. You've grown up.

726
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,580
Kid,

727
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,010
are you here so late

728
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,370
to see the tiger again?

729
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,050
Next time.

730
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
I'm here to ask you about something.

731
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,360
Uncle Qian,

732
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,300
do you often lose the meat for feeding the beasts

733
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,430
in the Beast Garden?

734
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,550
How did you know?

735
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,270
Don't worry, Uncle Qian.

736
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,010
We're here to catch the thief.

737
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,180
I'm not clear

738
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,390
about losing meat either.

739
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,340
When I entered the Beast Garden decades ago,

740
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,640
I only remember that half a stone of meat

741
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,570
was enough each day.

742
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,580
But one day,

743
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,180
I used up one more kilogram for no reason.

744
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,730
Since then,

745
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,630
we had less meat to feed every day.

746
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,500
This increased every month

747
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,360
until it reached five kilograms.

748
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,200
This went on for seven or eight years.

749
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,180
Then it became one kilogram again.

750
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,730
This kept repeating.

751
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,320
It's very strange.

752
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,060
It's like...

753
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,860
It's like

754
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,650
someone raised a beast

755
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,430
until it died at 7 or 8 years old.

756
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,300
Then he raised another young beast,

757
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:51,780
right?

758
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,940
Yes.

759
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,960
At first, I wanted to investigate this matter.

760
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,440
People laughed at me for being too worried.

761
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,230
It's just that the beasts

762
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,840
have varying appetites.

763
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,940
That's right.

764
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,980
It's easy to sneak a small lynx into the palace

765
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,910
and raise it for seven or eight years.

766
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,170
When it is about to die,

767
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,570
you can bring two more in.

768
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,340
This...

769
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,740
Small lynx?

770
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,490
The Beast Garden doesn't have lynxes.

771
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,150
Uncle Qian,

772
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,950
we're talking about a case.

773
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,400
By the way, Uncle Qian,

774
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,540
where do you usually store the feed?

775
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,800
Is it easy to be stolen?

776
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,710
This is why I'm doubtful,

777
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,910
but there's no investigation.

778
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,570
The feed is usually locked in the warehouse.

779
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
But other than me,

780
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,030
only the Ministry of Industry

781
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,660
has a spare key.

782
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,360
It's impossible

783
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
for a thief to steal meat

784
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,380
for so long.

785
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,280
Oh no! Let's go!

786
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,740
What happened?

787
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,980
The Ministry of Industry is responsible for repairing the palace.

788
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,780
The lynx mountain was created by the Ministry too.

789
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,640
Where is the key to the Beast Garden's warehouse?

790
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,880
The Ministry has a spare key.

791
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,730
The four men were planted here by the Ministry.

792
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,100
They also have

793
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,540
the poisoned palace map.

794
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,300
So,

795
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,650
the four of them

796
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,770
didn't return to their residence after the location was chosen.

797
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,590
Instead, they went to Shanyi Workshop.

798
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,220
Before this,

799
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,260
I thought it was done by the Shan Gudao alone,

800
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,140
but it doesn't seem the case now.

801
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,420
Maybe I was wrong.

802
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,370
Someone from the Ministry of Industry

803
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,960
was afraid that the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss would be leaked,

804
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,520
so he arranged them to go to the Shanyi Workshop

805
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,120
and had the lynxes kill them.

806
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,290
Those who can do this

807
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,510
will not only have worked in the Ministry for many years,

808
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,760
but also be involved in choosing the location

809
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,750
in order to plan at all times.

810
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,210
Ministry of Industry Supervisor, Liu Kehe.

811
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,560
If he didn’t inform Shan Gudao

812
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,910
and brought Li Fei and the others

813
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,390
to the Shanyi Workshop privately,

814
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,300
then Shan Gudao would also know

815
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,960
that the murderer is Liu Kehe.

816
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,240
Let's go.

817
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,440
We're too late.

818
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,710
Shan Gudao lost Li Fei and the others.

819
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,680
If he wants to find the Pagoda of Bliss,

820
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,810
his only clue

821
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,460
is Liu Kehe.

822
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,110
This is tricky.

823
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,960
What's the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss

824
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,470
that he needs to protect with his life?

825
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,640
Did he know about the Karmic Bugs too?

826
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,450
If he had known,

827
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,160
he should have noticed

828
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,610
the Demon Monk from the start.

829
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,010
So,

830
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
he must have had an ulterior motive.

831
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,230
It's a mess here.

832
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,510
We can't find any clues either.

833
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,260
Think about it.

834
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,530
Liu Kehe chose to commit suicide

835
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,290
to protect the secret of the Pagoda of Bliss.

836
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,730
I'm sure he won't leave any clues behind either.

837
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,550
The Pagoda of Bliss must never be recovered.

838
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,720
[The Pagoda of Bliss must never be recovered. Otherwise, chaos will erupt.]

839
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,380
Otherwise, chaos will erupt.

840
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,460
Li Lianhua,

841
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,260
I remember you said that

842
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,390
before Li Fei and the others died,

843
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,040
they said they saw an osmanthus tree

844
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,630
and estimated where the entrance was.

845
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,430
That's right.

846
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,820
They only recalled it when they saw the osmanthus tree.

847
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,100
It means the scenery at the entrance

848
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,900
is different from ten years ago.

849
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,480
An abandoned palace has changed so much.

850
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,120
Maybe

851
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,770
this is also a clue.

852
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,610
Maybe after they accidentally entered the Pagoda of Bliss,

853
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,480
Liu Kehe used his power to alter the palace

854
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,030
and hide the entrance.

855
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,970
Look.

856
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
These are the records

857
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,730
of the Ministry's construction near the abandoned palace.

858
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,260
There are quite a few moves.

859
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,900
They planted 53 trees,

860
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,150
flattened eight mountains,

861
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,370
filled five wells,

862
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,420
and repaired six canals.

863
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,170
Based on the osmanthus tree

864
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,830
we saw these days,

865
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,050
the entrance is probably

866
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,100
in this location.

867
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,960
It indeed is a well.

868
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,260
Let's go.

869
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,540
Let's go to the abandoned garden now.

870
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,030
Li Lianhua.

871
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,400
What's wrong?

872
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,980
A jade pendant hanging on the waist

873
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,340
shouldn't be so heavy.

874
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,210
[A promise of life and death]
