[Episode 2]

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,620
[The Imperial Palace of Taijin]

4
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,860
Your Majesty.

5
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,310
Li Wei,

6
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,870
do you admit your guilt?

7
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,710
Your Majesty,

8
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,430
I do.

9
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,910
You launched a night attack,

10
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,750
yet the Yao Army ambushed us precisely.

11
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,470
Either they were too cunning,

12
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,360
or you're unfit to command.

13
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Or worse, there's a spy in your army.

14
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,470
Besides,

15
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,400
your daughter Li Shuang...

16
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,710
charged in on her own.

17
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,430
If Lucheng had fallen,

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,079
even executing you all

19
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,310
wouldn't be enough
to calm the people's rage.

20
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,110
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,190
I authorized Li Shuang
to lead the troops into battle.

22
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,910
It was a desperate move
in a moment of crisis.

23
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,590
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

24
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,050
A desperate move, you say?

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
How dare you Li family

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,329
gamble with my Taijin land!

27
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,320
[Su Muyang, Crown Prince of Taijin]

28
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,150
Father.

29
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,750
General Li has led
the Changfeng Army for years.

30
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,430
He's brought home countless victories.

31
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,240
Fortunately,

32
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,220
we won this battle

33
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,680
and Lucheng still stands.

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,450
Please, Father, don't be angry.

35
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,800
[Su Muli, Prince Li of Taijin]

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,750
Five thousand soldiers died in the valley,

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,280
and you call that a victory?

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,150
Are you defending the Li family

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,130
because of your past with them?

40
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,470
[Prime Minister of Taijin, Ji Lan]

41
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,910
Your Majesty,

42
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,400
in my opinion,

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,240
the Battle of Lucheng resulted in heavy losses,

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,750
but General Li

45
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,710
has long defended Taijin's border

46
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:45,870
has long defended Taijin's border

47
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,360
with the Changfeng Army.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
His service is beyond doubt.

49
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,400
I urge Your Majesty to reconsider.

50
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,430
Enough.

51
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,079
Li Wei,

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,960
for your past service,

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
I'll let this go, for now.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,870
You have half a month to find

55
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,600
the traitor.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,430
Yes, Your Majesty!

57
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,400
You've fought hard on the front lines.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,079
Rest at home for now.

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
Let Li Shuang lead the investigation.

60
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,520
If she finds the traitor,

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
your faults may be redeemed.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,120
If not,

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,290
the rest of you,

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,620
tell me what punishment he deserves.

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,450
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,110
if we fail to find the traitor,

67
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,440
I'll accept full responsibility.

68
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,290
Just as you predicted, General.

69
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,610
We looked into strange movements

70
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,870
among the soldiers' families,

71
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,390
then we found that
only one fled the capital,

72
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,910
and has now gone missing.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,130
It's the Deputy General

74
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,120
Huo Du's family.

75
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,120
On the day of the Battle of Lucheng,

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,430
after planning the surprise attack,

77
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,160
Huo Du

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,950
pretended to be sick to avoid the battle,

79
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,950
yet the Yao Army was fully prepared.

80
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,500
These two things

81
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,390
are a bit too coincidental.

82
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,909
We can't wait any longer.

83
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,409
The half-month deadline is approaching.

84
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,140
The sooner we find the traitor,

85
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,920
the safer my father will be.

86
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,580
Stop!

87
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,710
Who goes there?

88
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,680
We have the travel permit.
Let us pass quickly.

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,270
You think we'll let you pass
just because you say so?

90
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,610
The checkpoint is on high alert today.

91
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,940
All people must be thoroughly inspected.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,740
Greetings, Your Highness!

93
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,420
We didn't know it was you.

94
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,770
Please forgive us.

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,120
Your vigilance

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,860
speaks well of your duty.

97
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,520
There's no need to apologize.

98
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,540
May I proceed now?

99
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,390
Safe travels, Your Highness.

100
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,650
To put it nicely,
we call him "Your Highness",

101
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,870
but you know what people really say...

102
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,550
Shut up!

103
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,020
Gossiping about the Crown Prince?

104
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,820
You want to get yourself killed?

105
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,060
Report this to Lord Li immediately.

106
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,700
Yes, sir.

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,190
Be careful.

108
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,120
Are you alright?

109
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,830
Hold on.

110
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,480
Muyang,

111
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,160
we're not fugitives.

112
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,350
[Tai Jin Li Ting]

113
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,010
Why did we sneak out
of the city like that?

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,190
General Li is still under house arrest,

115
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,390
and His Majesty is wary of the Li family.

116
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,680
If they catch you leaving the capital
without permission,

117
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,140
it will bring you trouble.

118
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,680
That house arrest is awful!

119
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,270
Father watches me all day,

120
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,070
and I can't even slip out for fun.

121
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,040
Ting,

122
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,970
your father

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,950
sent you to see Li Shuang in Lucheng,

124
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,800
so you'd stay out of politics.

125
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,000
I've already sent word to your sister.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,750
Stay cautious and keep a low profile.

127
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,350
Don't expose your identity.

128
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,040
The road to Lucheng is long and bumpy,

129
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,730
and Shuang is so fierce.

130
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,550
If Father and you hadn't planned this,

131
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,340
I wouldn't even bother going.

132
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,909
This was your sister's

133
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,640
favorite biography.

134
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,190
Please give it to her for me.

135
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,120
Just tell her...

136
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,110
Never mind.

137
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,080
No need to say anything.

138
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,260
Muyang,

139
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,750
since you miss her so much,

140
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,490
why not come with me?

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,630
I'm afraid...

142
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,370
I no longer have the right to see her.

143
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,500
It's getting late,

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,750
you should go now.

145
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,800
Stay safe.

146
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,000
I've been here for days

147
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,630
and never heard

148
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,690
birds singing in this military camp.

149
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,030
This is your reward for delivering intel

150
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,840
during the Battle of Lucheng.

151
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,110
If you want a good life,

152
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,630
just keep following orders.

153
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,870
Don't worry,

154
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,220
I have a bigger gift for you.

155
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,270
No wonder Li Shuang was so wary of me.

156
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,390
So there really is

157
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,710
a traitor in the Changfeng Army.

158
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,270
General,

159
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,660
Huo Du is cunning.

160
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,710
I tracked him to the woods,
but lost his trail.

161
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,630
I planned to wait outside his tent,

162
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,690
but unexpectedly,

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,650
someone else returned with Huo Du.

164
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,710
Was it Jin'an?

165
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,170
I always knew that boy was suspicious.

166
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,460
I'll drag him in,

167
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,680
and interrogate him along with Huo Du.

168
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,870
Lord Huo,

169
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,820
what brings you here this late?

170
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,460
Nothing.

171
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,530
You may leave now.

172
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,060
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,440
General,

174
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,950
I request an audience.

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,090
Come in.

176
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,280
The other day, when I asked
if you feared I was a spy,

177
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,750
I meant no harm,

178
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,210
but you got so defensive.

179
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,090
So I kept an eye out for you.

180
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,200
You kept an eye out,

181
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,020
or were you in cahoots with them?

182
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,080
Even Mr. Ji, an adult, didn't catch him,

183
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,270
and you, with your tiny arms and legs,

184
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,330
say you managed it?

185
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,510
I've always been better than all of you.

186
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,270
Don't forget you lost to me once.

187
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,870
Remember?

188
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,190
That never happened. Don't talk nonsense.

189
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,860
Why did you do all this?

190
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,830
Because I want you to know

191
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,090
that keeping me around

192
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,350
was the right choice.

193
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,210
You did very well

194
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,720
on this.

195
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,130
Ji Ran, Luo Teng.

196
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
Huo Du leaked intel

197
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,560
and colluded with the illegitimate Yao.

198
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,760
Now we have the proof.

199
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,550
Go arrest him.

200
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Yes, General.

201
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,620
All the valuables are gone.

202
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
He must have fled.

203
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,840
He won't get far.

204
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,600
Go after him.

205
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,280
Remember,

206
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,600
I want him alive.

207
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,150
Yes, General.

208
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,500
Report!

209
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,510
General.

210
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,800
Young Master was kidnapped by bandits
on his way to our camp.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,030
The bandits sent this jade pendant,

212
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,230
asking you to meet them on the mountain.

213
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,290
Why did Ting come here?

214
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:51,900
Ji Ran,

215
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,720
take a squad

216
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,160
and follow me to rescue Li Ting.

217
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,620
The rest of you stay at camp,

218
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,140
keep searching for Huo Du!

219
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,990
Make sure to catch him alive.

220
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,030
Yes, General!

221
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,860
I'll go with you.

222
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,300
It's dangerous.

223
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,280
No matter how strong you are,
you're still a kid.

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,140
Just stay here.

225
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,340
Since you're my soldier,

226
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,820
you must follow my orders.

227
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,490
Go back.

228
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,380
Brothers.

229
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,270
Here are the last two dishes.

230
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,270
We're all set now!

231
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,070
Come on, try this.

232
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,790
Share some with them.

233
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,240
Alright, thanks, boss!

234
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:43,790
Eat up.

235
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Dig in, everyone!

236
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,630
Okay, boss!

237
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,320
Brothers!

238
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,240
Boss, sit here, come on.

239
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,270
Here, try this dish.

240
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,080
It's amazing!

241
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,120
Sure, thanks, boss!

242
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,910
Cheers!

243
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,750
Let's drink, brothers.

244
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,410
Bottoms up!

245
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,750
You bandit! Let me go!

246
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,120
Do you know who I am?

247
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,510
Let me go! You...

248
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,870
-Starve me to death!
-It'll be worthless if you're dead.

249
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,200
Try starve me to death if you dare!

250
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,360
Do you know who I am?

251
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,550
Ouyang!

252
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,840
-Bandit!
-You're so good at cooking.

253
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,390
Bandit!

254
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:11,960
Come on.

255
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,440
If you've got the guts,
just starve me to death!

256
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,060
[Leader of Feiyun Stronghold, Ouyang Jun]

257
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,270
Brothers.

258
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,150
Listen up, all of you.

259
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,790
Tonight,

260
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,840
eat and drink well,

261
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,680
so you'll have the strength to work later.

262
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
Understand?

263
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,550
Understood!

264
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,680
Cheers.

265
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,950
-Cheers!
-Drink up!

266
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,440
Come on, fill it up.

267
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,270
General Li has been
guarding the border for years.

268
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
She's quite a figure.

269
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,770
Are you sure...

270
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,880
she'd dare come here,
risking her own life?

271
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,710
Don't worry.

272
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,310
That girl

273
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,810
has never been afraid of risking her life.

274
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,490
Shuang!

275
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,270
Don't move.

276
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,890
Not hiding underground like a rat

277
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,240
was the worst decision you ever made.

278
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Well, well,
what a grand entrance, General Li.

279
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,830
Huo Du.

280
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,200
Taijin has treated you well,

281
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,870
why did you betray your country?

282
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,800
Treated me well?

283
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,120
In the Changfeng Army,

284
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,600
to put it nicely,

285
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,820
I'm a Deputy General.

286
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,440
But to put it bluntly,

287
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,030
I'm no different from those minions

288
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,150
behind you.

289
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,120
If I don't take my chance now,

290
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,080
how will I ever gain

291
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
wealth and glory?

292
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,240
So...

293
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,030
you sacrificed

294
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,170
five thousand of our brothers for money?

295
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,200
It's war.

296
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,720
People always die.

297
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,360
Enough nonsense.

298
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,660
If you want your brother to live,

299
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,850
tell your men to drop their weapons

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,120
and surrender.

301
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,440
A mere bandit

302
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,920
dares to threaten the Changfeng Army?

303
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,550
It seems that Deputy General Huo

304
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
promised Yao State my head as a gift.

305
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,310
So you'll take the credit

306
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,920
and he'll get the money?

307
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,840
But did you know

308
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,760
the person you're holding

309
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,200
isn't even related to me?

310
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,370
What did you say?

311
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,630
Shuang...

312
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,450
Everyone in Taijin knows

313
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,160
I'm General Li's adopted daughter.

314
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,270
Do you really think I'm stupid enough

315
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,540
to trade my life

316
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,290
for his?

317
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,320
If he dies,

318
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,350
I'd be the rightful heir

319
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,630
to the Changfeng Army.

320
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,900
When General Li comes for revenge,

321
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,220
he'll slaughter everyone here.

322
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,390
And that has nothing to do with me.

323
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,150
Li Shuang!

324
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,240
What are you talking about?

325
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,870
Be quiet!

326
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,110
Is she telling the truth?

327
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,120
Ouyang.

328
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,240
Don't listen to her.

329
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
She's saying this

330
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,550
just to buy some time.

331
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,630
I don't believe

332
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,200
you could watch him die without helping.

333
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
If you don't dare to kill him,

334
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,490
I'll do it myself.

335
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,910
Everyone, escort Li Ting back to camp!

336
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,480
How dare you fool me?

337
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,040
Is Li Shuang in danger?

338
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,270
What are you waiting for?

339
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,270
Attack them! Now!

340
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,000
Attack!

341
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,960
Earlier I accidentally
hit the spiritual acupoint,

342
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,620
and gained tremendous power.

343
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,400
This time, I'll try again.

344
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,770
♪ In my chest ♪

345
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,940
♪ A raging sea of fire burns ♪

We can't stay here long.

403
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,360
Let's go.

404
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,450
You go ahead,

405
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,530
I still have unfinished business.

406
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,720
I can't let Huo Du slip away.

407
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,970
It's so quiet.

408
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,680
Are they all dead?

409
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,920
Be careful, it could be a trap.

410
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,240
Go check.

411
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,040
Yes, sir!

412
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,000
Boss.

413
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,010
They're gone.

414
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,970
Follow this path down the mountain.

415
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,010
The Changfeng Army camp

416
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,450
is less than an hour away.

417
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,930
I saved your life,

418
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,050
yet you hold a knife to my throat.

419
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,680
Is this how you repay kindness?

420
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,810
I never mentioned

421
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,160
I was going to the Changfeng Army camp.

422
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,960
How did you know my destination?

423
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,500
Who exactly are you?

424
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,450
When the time is right,

425
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,830
I will tell you.

426
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,430
If you won't tell me,

427
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,070
I'll bring you back

428
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,190
and interrogate you myself.

429
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,460
You...

430
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,680
Blood.

431
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Blood...

432
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,360
Captain.

433
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,520
Deputy General Huo,

434
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,080
he...

435
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,450
Why is it just Huo Du?

436
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,490
Where's the General?

437
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,440
You two,

438
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,070
take him in custody.

439
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,930
The rest of you,

440
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,830
follow me.

441
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes, sir!

442
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,110
General, are you alright?

443
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,020
I'm fine.

444
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,450
Take some men up the mountain,

445
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,340
and capture all the bandits up there.

446
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,940
Remember,

447
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,310
I want them alive.

448
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,550
Yes, General.

449
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,640
Young Master has been safely returned.

450
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,960
Huo Du has been locked up

451
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,030
and is under heavy guard,

452
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,630
awaiting General's orders.

453
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,740
What about Jin'an?

454
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,830
I never expected my body

455
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,760
would have
such incredible healing power.

456
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,080
General, General.

457
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,120
General.

458
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,530
-General.
-General.

459
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,680
Jin'an.

460
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,920
I'm going to sleep.

461
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,830
If you have something to say,
let's talk tomorrow.

462
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,160
Your voice sounds strange.

463
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,360
Are you feeling unwell?

464
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,710
I'm just tired.

465
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,190
Please go back, General.

466
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,830
Let me see.

467
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,120
Why are you sleeping without clothes?

468
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,590
What are you doing?

469
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,560
I'm asking,
why are you sleeping without clothes?

470
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,430
I'm used to it.

471
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,050
But General,

472
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,230
have you ever heard of
keeping a distance between men and women?

473
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,560
This is a military camp.

474
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,130
Everyone here is a brother-in-arms.

475
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,960
Besides,

476
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,850
you're just a kid.

477
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,310
Jin'an.

478
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,070
Jin'an.

479
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,030
Tell me,

480
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,090
how did you get that mark on your back?

481
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,770
I never paid much attention to it.

482
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,440
Maybe...

483
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,750
I was born with it.

484
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,190
Do you know anyone else

485
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,600
with the same mark as you?

486
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,180
Today at the bandit stronghold,

487
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,980
I met someone.

488
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,800
He helped me escape,

489
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,720
and he had the same mark

490
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
on his back as yours.

491
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,160
What a coincidence.

492
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,490
It's such a unique mark,

493
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,450
and I've never seen it before.

494
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
But I've been seeing it a lot lately.

495
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,480
Now that I look closely,

496
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,570
you two even share

497
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,050
similar facial features.

498
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,920
Could he possibly be...

499
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
your father?

500
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,760
Then why didn't he ask me about you?

501
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,030
Did he leave you in my camp on purpose?

502
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,830
Was it because...

503
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,790
The man you're talking about,

504
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,790
I don't really know him.

505
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,120
The world is a big place,

506
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,550
it's not strange
that some people may look alike.

507
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,440
In my opinion,

508
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,390
if he risked his life to save you,

509
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,220
then maybe...

510
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,580
he meant you no harm.

511
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,280
General.

512
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:51,920
General.

513
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,970
Something's wrong!

514
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,030
Young Master is making a scene again.

515
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,600
You should get some rest now.

516
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,210
I'll come see you tomorrow.

517
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,990
That was so close.

518
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,510
Stay out of my way!

519
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,640
Young Master!

520
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,240
Stop him!

521
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,810
Get out of my way!

522
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,440
-Stop him!
-Young Master.

523
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,170
Stop him!

524
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:17,960
Young Master!

525
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,000
Let go! Stay away!

526
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,750
I don't want to stay here another day!

527
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,400
I want to go home!

528
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,440
Young Master, Young Master.

529
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,590
General hasn't returned yet,

530
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,880
we can't let you go
without her permission.

531
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,960
If she finds out,

532
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,310
she'll definitely get angry at us.

533
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,410
So what if she gets angry?

534
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,550
At worst she can just kill me.

535
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,550
That's what she did earlier anyway!

536
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,470
General.

537
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,710
you are finally here.

538
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,430
Why did you suddenly come to the border?

539
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,030
Did something happen in the capital?

540
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,310
It's all because of the defeat at Lucheng.

541
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,030
Father took all the blame himself

542
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,180
and is now under house arrest.

543
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,550
He had no choice

544
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,410
but to ask Muyang to escort me out.

545
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,400
How is Father doing?

546
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,920
He's doing incredibly well,

547
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,350
eating, sleeping,

548
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,630
skipping all his morning courts.

549
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,390
As for me,

550
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,680
the moment I just arrived
at this godforsaken place

551
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,880
and my dear sister shot me with an arrow.

552
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,030
If I hadn't been wearing that chest guard,

553
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,160
I'd be dead already!

554
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,510
Good thing you wore the chest guard.

555
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,390
Ting,

556
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,680
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,140
If you don't dare to kill him,

558
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,510
I'll do it myself.

559
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,710
What I did was just a strategy.

560
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,350
You should trust me.

561
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,140
After what you just said and did,

562
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,000
how can you expect me to trust you?

563
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,360
I've always treated you like real family,

564
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,120
never thought you could be so ruthless.

565
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,650
Father always favored you,

566
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
but I'm his biological son!

567
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,820
He took you in off the streets,

568
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,910
yet he gave you the Changfeng Army.

569
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,280
Have you captured Huo Du?

570
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,580
Yes.

571
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,770
Where are you going?

572
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,970
I'm going to kill him!

573
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,960
If it weren't for him,

574
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,240
Father wouldn't be under house arrest,

575
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,160
I wouldn't have been forced to come

576
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,960
to this godforsaken place,

577
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,620
and got kidnapped by bandits.

578
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,590
You just said you wanted him alive, right?

579
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,350
Then I'll go with them

580
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,460
and escort Huo Du back to the capital.

581
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,270
Go ahead.

582
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,030
This journey will be challenging.

583
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,830
There might be

584
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,460
more bandits and outlaws,

585
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,920
or Huo Du's remaining men.

586
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,800
Since you want
to command the Changfeng Army,

587
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,130
this is your best chance

588
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,780
to earn some credit.

589
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,010
Shuang, you think I can't do it?

590
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,630
Do you know why Father

591
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,830
never taught you to lead the troops?

592
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,290
Because you're impulsive

593
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,200
and arrogant.

594
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,680
So in your eyes,

595
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,110
I'm completely useless?

596
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,480
Right,

597
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,000
you're meticulous,

598
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,550
and Father is brave and mighty.

599
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,270
So what?

600
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,400
In the end,
there was still a traitor in the army,

601
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,550
and he still got punished by His Majesty.

602
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,000
You!

603
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,960
If you're that capable,

604
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,050
then go ahead, do it again.

605
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,380
Stab me rght here!

606
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,930
This time, I'm not wearing a chest guard.

607
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,520
Do it!

608
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,120
General.

609
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,150
Why didn't you report

610
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,510
before entering?

611
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,620
I heard you
and the Young Master were arguing.

612
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,810
I was worried, so I came to check on you.

613
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,100
I acted rashly.

614
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,840
Please forgive me, General.

615
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,310
Tonight,

616
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,580
you intercepted key evidence
of Huo Du's treason,

617
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,910
so you deserve a reward.

618
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,240
Thank you, General.

619
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,320
He's just a low-ranking soldier,

620
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,090
and you treat him with kindness.

621
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,590
But when it comes to me,
it's always scolding.

622
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,750
So in your eyes,

623
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,920
am I worse than him?

624
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,720
That's right.

625
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,880
The Changfeng Army
has no place for idlers.

626
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,940
I only value people

627
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,180
with real talent.

628
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,130
He's just a kid.

629
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,060
If he's wrong,
you should teach him a lesson.

630
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,410
Why are you reluctant to discipline him?

631
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
You're a kid too.

632
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,070
There are things

633
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,720
you don't understand yet.

634
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,550
Being young

635
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,150
doesn't mean we don't feel things.

636
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,219
If you truly despised him

637
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,489
as you said,

638
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,330
you wouldn't have
risked your life to save him.

639
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,380
I understand this,

640
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,540
and so does he.

641
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,440
It's just that, sometimes,
the closer you are to someone,

642
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,400
it's hard

643
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,090
to say how you really feel.

644
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,480
I see.

645
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,060
You may go now.

646
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,429
What's wrong?

647
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,889
It's burning up.

648
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,760
Help!

649
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:11,810
Fetch the army physician!
