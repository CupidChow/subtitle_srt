00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,490
All heavenly power concentrates in Yun!

4
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,300
Evil spirits shall be shunned!

5
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,960
Stop!

6
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,630
Target the devil!

7
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,280
Kill!

8
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,090
How dare you!

9
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
Go check on her.

10
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,470
Her Ladyship's meridians are all broken.

11
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,470
I'm afraid she'll die soon.

12
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,360
Li Mo is a skilled physician.

13
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,530
Ask him to come.

14
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,280
Yes.

15
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,000
What's so urgent that you had to
summon me with the Blood Spell?

16
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,310
Long Yuan nearly halted his meeting

[Li Mo]

18
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,430
to come back with me.

19
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,829
I can't tell you much now.

20
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,070
Soon you'll know.

21
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,600
Let's go.

22
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,829
Watch your tongue when you

23
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:44,680
treat the patient.

24
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,240
What patient?

25
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,670
Hurry!

26
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,310
You'll know soon.

27
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,770
Just go.

28
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,860
She's Divine...

29
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,940
Assess her injury status.

30
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,980
She's only a mortal.

31
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,960
Just do your job. Stop gibbering.

32
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,330
She's beyond cure.

33
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,200
The medicine in Nine Heavens
contains much spiritual energy,

34
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,800
which will definitely crush

35
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,120
a mortal like her.

36
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,580
Now, she is severely injured.

37
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,280
Her foundation is destroyed,
and her energy flow is disrupted.

38
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,580
She is done for.

39
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,380
Her foundation is destroyed...

40
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,070
Exactly.

41
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,600
She must have taken a pill

42
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,060
that could quickly improve
her inner power.

43
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,400
It backfired on her after she was wounded.

44
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,940
Can you wake her up?

45
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,310
Though I can't cure her,

46
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm able to keep her awake

47
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,690
for a brief moment.

48
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,500
Then wake her up.

49
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,700
I need to ask her something.

50
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,750
Chiyang Fruit reconstructs
bones and meridians.

51
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,960
It helps the dead return to life.

52
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
In the hands of immortal sects,

53
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,930
it will assist with cultivation.

54
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,159
In the hands of demonic sects,

55
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,970
it will

56
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,640
inevitably trigger a brutal war.

57
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,830
Disciples at the mountain foot reported

58
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,360
that Yinlian Sect had stood ready to act.

59
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,560
Zhang Suan, whether your
qihai will be fixed

60
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,070
depends on this move.

61
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,390
You must be extra cautious on this trip.

62
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,800
-Yes, Sect Leader.

Keep this Elevation Pill.

It's a treasure of Jingyun Sect.

69
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,640
Upon consuming this pill,

70
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,950
your energy will be largely
strengthened in two hours.

71
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,000
There used to be
three such pills in the sect.

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,340
Two were taken away by Qingyue.

73
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,800
This is the last one.

74
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,430
You should keep it

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,370
in case of emergency.

76
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,980
Thank you, Master.

77
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,080
You finally woke up.

78
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,720
Heavenly Lord...

79
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,390
A pill from the mortal realm.

80
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,350
You intended to forcibly improve

81
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,590
your inner power with this pill's help,

82
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,730
disregarding the damage
it'd bring to your foundation.

83
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,770
You haven't formed a golden core yet.

84
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,440
Do you want to be forever stuck at

85
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,570
the Foundation Establishment Stage?

86
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Why did you go after the White Snake?

87
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,080
I was seeking revenge.

88
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,480
For what?

89
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,630
Heavenly Lord,

90
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,750
11 years ago,

91
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,320
did the White Snake visit
the mortal realm?

92
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,680
Yes, it did.

93
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,300
Do you remember where it went?

94
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,840
It was Nanyu Village,
at the foot of Yufan Mountain.

95
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
With its appearance

96
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,180
came a massive flood,

97
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,930
which caused my mother's death.

98
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,450
What can I do now?

99
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,720
My brother!

Obnoxious white snake!

I've lost my home!

Come help us!

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,980
Mom, please wake up!

108
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,180
[Young Li Qingyue]

109
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,130
Don't leave me alone!

110
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,610
Mom!

111
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,800
Say something, Mom!

112
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,360
Wake up, Mom!

113
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,880
Mom!

114
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,360
Here you are.

115
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,750
The flood and

116
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,870
the chaos brought by the White Snake

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,150
plunged the entire village
into immense suffering.

118
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,960
Thereafter, I became a drifter.

119
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,640
My master Sage Qingyang
then brought me to Jingyun Sect.

120
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,860
That's how I survived.

121
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,540
Why did you never tell me about it?

122
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,750
Because you never asked.

123
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,910
You don't seem to

124
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,420
be interested in my past at all.

125
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I already told you

126
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,840
the White Snake would die after today.

127
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
Why did you have to attack it?

128
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,390
It killed my mother.

129
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,790
I had to be the one

130
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,260
to end its life.

131
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,180
The flood was a natural disaster.

132
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,700
It had nothing to do with the White Snake.

133
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,150
A mortal disciple of a tiny sect

134
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,350
and a mere gate guardian though you are,

135
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,930
you sure have a strong desire to kill.

136
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,600
Maybe you don't think much

137
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,600
of Jingyun Sect.

138
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,830
But in the mortal realm,

139
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,050
it is a prestigious cultivation sect.

140
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,400
Humans yearn for immortality,

141
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,150
but the majority don't have access.

142
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
I come from a farming family.

143
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,290
I was blessed with the chance
to become a cultivator.

144
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,750
But it took more than luck
to pass so many trials

145
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
and to be selected as

146
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
an outer-circle disciple.

147
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,950
What else did it take?

148
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
The aspiration to better the world.

149
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,790
The will to become an immortal.

150
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,340
The resolve to eliminate the evil.

151
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,750
Then what feelings

152
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,510
do you have for me?

153
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,580
Heavenly Lord, I'm your wife.

154
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,240
All I have for you

155
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,650
is love.

156
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,630
Does she look like

157
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,060
a certain someone?

158
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,120
Very much so.

159
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,690
But I have faith in my medical skills.

160
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,520
She's only a mortal.

161
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,230
That certain someone

162
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,920
would never try to kill the White Snake.

163
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,020
Is it really dead?

164
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,790
It is.

165
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,550
That sword from Jingyun Sect
is quite good.

166
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,720
It penetrated the snake's

167
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,510
vital spot

168
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,100
and took its life,

169
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,210
leaving no chance of survival.

170
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,330
Is she...

171
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,730
really beyond cure?

172
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,250
I was going to talk about it.

173
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,440
A magical fruit named
Chiyang just appeared

174
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,760
in the mortal realm.

175
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,780
It can reconstruct meridians

176
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,510
and bring the dead back to life.

177
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,270
Only that fruit

178
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,210
can revive her.

179
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,210
Will she really die?

180
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,740
Divine Lord Siling

181
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,060
wouldn't die.

182
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,640
But this girl is a mortal.

183
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,730
So she will die.

184
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,290
It must've sensed your presence,

185
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,070
so it's acting up again.

186
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,900
You've been away for years
for various excuses.

187
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Are you not going to take a look at it?

188
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,440
As you know, I'm avoiding it on purpose.

189
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,750
Why bother to ask?

190
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,720
You haven't progressed
for hundreds of years.

191
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,850
It must be a challenge you have to face.

192
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,750
No pain, no gain.

193
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,880
Why not give it a try?

194
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,930
Master,

195
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
I know what I'm doing.

196
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,660
We're up for a big task this time,

197
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,560
aren't we?

198
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,830
Master already told us about...

199
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,830
Let me check that out.

200
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,810
Jiang Bian!

201
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,510
I-It's a disciple from Chunyang Sect.

202
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,910
A stab in the chest.
Rotten bones and flesh.

203
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,130
It must've been done by Yinlian Sect.

204
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,370
Yinlian Sect's people have arrived.

205
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,910
We're one step late.

206
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,590
Watch out, everyone.

207
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,480
These bats must've been
enlightened and demonized

208
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,650
after absorbing

209
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,070
Chiyang Fruit's energy.

210
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,880
Senior, be careful.

211
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,040
Don't be scratched by the bats.

212
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,410
Thank you for your concern.

213
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,110
Disciples of Jingyun Sect,

214
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,410
do you want to die here?

215
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:49,980
You demon!

216
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,270
I'm a demon. Then what are you?

217
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,750
A knucklehead who fails to

218
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,920
defeat a demon

219
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
after years of cultivation?

220
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,520
Senior!

221
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,520
Take this.

222
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,480
-Senior!
-Senior!

223
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,540
-Keep up!
-Keep up!

224
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,160
Hurry!

225
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,510
W-Where are you going?

226
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,700
Heavenly Lord, please help Her Ladyship!

227
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,000
She cooked for you even though she hadn't

228
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,880
been healed from falling off the cliff.

229
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,340
Now, she has been maimed
by someone unknown.

230
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,840
I feel so sorry for her.

231
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,880
Do you think she will die?

232
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,070
She must not die!

233
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,340
Despicable!

234
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,440
How offensive.

235
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,790
Where are your manners?

236
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,790
I'm leading the way for you.

237
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,790
Yet instead of feeling grateful,

238
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,160
you hurled an insult at me.

239
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,200
Are all the disciples of Jingyun Sect

240
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,820
as ill-mannered as you are?

241
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,520
You're being unreasonable!

242
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,720
You brought us here only to

243
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,960
make us fight the demonic beasts for you,

244
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
so you could get Chiyang Fruit, right?

245
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,540
I know Jingyun Sect wants the fruit.

246
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,440
But I also need it to help Mr. Meng out.

247
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,120
Can't you just let me have it?

248
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,510
Those from demonic sects
are sly and cunning.

249
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,750
I won't believe you.

250
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,110
Activate Yufan Sword Formation

251
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,310
to help Senior Zhang!

252
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,890
Oh, no. This is a trap!

253
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,520
Out of my way!

254
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,810
Stay!

255
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,200
Senior Zhang!

256
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,330
Senior!

257
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,150
-Senior!
-Senior!

258
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,210
-Senior!
-Senior!

259
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,410
Heavenly Lord!

260
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,270
Did you save my life again?

261
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,590
I took the liberty of
killing the White Snake.

262
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,750
Are you still mad at me?

263
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,510
It was doomed anyway.

264
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,940
Might as well be killed by you.

265
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,800
I know I did wrong.

266
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,290
I'm sorry, Heavenly Lord.

267
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,910
Thank you for forgiving me.

268
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,230
Heavenly Lord!

269
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,380
My life is yours from now on.

270
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,330
Heavenly Lord!

271
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,440
Are you alright?

272
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,300
Don't touch me.

273
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,640
This is my room. Get out now.

274
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,090
I...

275
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,310
Out!

276
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,630
Heavenly Lord, if you feel unwell,

277
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,960
please do let me know.

278
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,900
Heavenly Lord, has it reoccurred?

279
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,630
After being hit by the Heavenly Lord,

280
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,780
how was Li Qingyue?

281
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,820
Badly injured, as I heard.

282
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,540
She was hanging on by a thread.

283
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,950
Has the Heavenly Lord done anything?

284
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,850
He descended to
the mortal realm last night

285
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,330
to get her Chiyang Fruit.

286
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,220
Now, she is much better.

287
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,910
What a lucky girl.

288
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,660
Ling'er!

289
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,370
You've heard about what
Master did for his wife, right?

290
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,880
You see, Master cares a lot about her.

291
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,210
You should stop...

292
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,720
Stop fantasizing about him.

293
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,900
Alright. Leave these troubles aside.

294
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,750
After my wedding,

295
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,630
I'll take you out for relaxation.

296
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,070
You're getting married again?

297
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,740
Yeah.

298
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,860
Ling'er, you're a wine expert.

299
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,220
Help me pick out

300
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,430
the suitable wine for my wedding.

301
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,050
Dad, you're in the heavenly realm now.

302
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
Can't you shake off your bad habits?

303
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,310
Oh, you... Unruly kid.

304
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,290
Senior Lyu, how much longer will it take?

305
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,250
Just a sec.

306
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Senior, given your injuries,

307
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,840
please stay in bed.

308
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,330
How long was I asleep?

309
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,940
Nearly three days.

310
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,920
Senior Zhang, you're really something.

311
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,200
Heavenly Lord Dacheng's hit only gave you

312
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,470
a three-day coma.

313
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,750
If it were someone else,

314
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,170
they would've died.

315
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
Three years ago, Senior Zhang's

316
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,920
qihai was seriously damaged.

317
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,190
Now, the hit

318
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,010
from Heavenly Lord Dacheng

319
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,820
has made the situation worse.

320
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,480
Just now, I used needles to seal

321
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,640
your two acupoints, qihai and laogong.

322
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,300
You need to rest for some days.

323
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,720
If...

324
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,830
Senior Zhang!

325
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,300
You haven't recovered yet.
Where are you going?

326
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,490
What were you going to say?

327
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,340
You wouldn't understand.

328
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,270
Senior, look.

329
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,740
I'm Zhang Suan. May I see the Sect Leader?

330
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,830
Come in.

331
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,150
Master.

332
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,680
Master Dan Yang.

333
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,880
You're injured.

334
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,610
Why did you come here

335
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,850
instead of resting?

336
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,900
Master, you once told me

337
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,240
that Chiyang Fruit could rebuild meridians

338
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,720
and even revive the dead, right?

339
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,320
Right. Chiyang Fruit is a
top-class miraculous medicine.

340
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,830
It can truly resurrect the dead.

341
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
What if an immortal takes it?

342
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Immortals are free of

343
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,080
all restraints that a mortal would have.

344
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,580
Chiyang Fruit isn't of help

345
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,040
to immortals.

346
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,990
In that case, why did

347
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,280
Heavenly Lord Dacheng
descend to the mortal realm

348
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,820
to fight for it?

349
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,590
Well...

350
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,860
Let me rephrase it.

351
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,390
In the Nine Heavens,

352
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,910
who would need this fruit

353
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,680
to prolong his or her life
after being severely injured?

354
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,110
My Lady, how impressive.

355
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,270
In just a few days,

356
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,530
your spiritual energy has grown so much.

357
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,420
The credit goes to
the lord's Chiyang Fruit.

358
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,440
After eating it,

359
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,480
my qihai seems to be
filled with spiritual energy.

360
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,880
Whenever I channel
my energy to regulate my breath,

361
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,880
I can feel it coursing
through my meridians smoothly.

362
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,330
What an amazing fruit.

363
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,400
If I had found it before,

364
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,040
it would've saved me
much cultivation effort.

365
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,920
The Heavenly Lord let me take
my revenge and saved my life.

366
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,690
I wonder how I could repay him.

367
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,640
That's tricky.

368
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,750
I've been here for a long time,

369
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,080
yet I still don't know
what the lord likes.

370
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,470
He seemed to enjoy

371
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,290
my cooking last time.

372
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,790
Why don't I cook for him again?

373
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,790
That's a great idea!

374
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,190
I happen to be craving it!

375
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,580
So do I! Count me in!

376
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,820
Go make arrangements.

377
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,400
Yes.

378
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,330
My Lady!

379
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,480
Why are you here?

380
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,250
The Heavenly Lord seemed unwell yesterday,

381
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,200
so I brought some food to visit him.

382
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,950
The lord is in seclusion.
It'll last a few days.

383
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,480
When it's over,

384
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,220
please let me know.

385
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,960
Sure.

386
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,310
Primordial Father God,

387
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,240

Why?

418

Why are you doing this to me?

419
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,320
Because you deserve to die.

420
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,480
Bai Jiusi...

421
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,280
Ruyue!

422
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,630
Stop!

423
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,710
Will the Heavenly Lord
get hungry in seclusion?

424
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,760
Will he miss my cooking?

425
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,110
Don't you remember, My Lady?

426
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,710
Immortals don't get hungry.

427
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,960
Then why do you eat every day?

428
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,990
Because I'm a foodie.

429
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,280
This is not the first time
for the lord to seclude himself.

430
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,410
Lord Cang Tu will take good care of him.

431
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,020
Does the lord often do this?

432
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,400
About once every ten years.

433
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,430
For what?

434
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,670
I don't know.

435
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,050
Perhaps for attending

436
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,520
to his old injuries?

437
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,180
Lady Qingyue.

438
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,810
Today is my father's wedding day.

439
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,570
I heard you hadn't received an invitation,

440
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,400
so I came to give one to you.

441
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,780
We look forward to your presence.

442
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,730
I'm not a close friend of Lord Fan's.

443
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,190
This is his big day.

444
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,120
I don't think I should show up.

445
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,340
You must be joking.

446
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,760
My father is the Heavenly Lord's disciple,

447
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,590
and you are the Heavenly Lord's wife.

448
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,920
A deep bond

449
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,230
between you two does exist.

450
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,230
These ties are not
to be ignored, are they?

451
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,280
I still don't think I should go.

452
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,670
Given the previous misunderstanding,

453
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,530
the guests will probably
feel uneasy if I'm around.

454
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,490
I see. Have it your way then.

455
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,460
There's another purpose of my visit.

456
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,690
What is it?

457
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,960
I'm keeping some of
the Heavenly Lord's belongings.

458
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,790
But now, you're managing Canglei Palace.

459
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,240
This responsibility should be yours.

460
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
What belongings?

461
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,120
His Lordship's personal items.

462
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,610
Okay. I'll take a look then.

463
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,290
We're talking about valuable items here.

464
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,650
Lady Qingyue, it's better if you go alone.

465
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,170
Stay put and wait for me.

466
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,140
Why would you choose such a remote place?

467
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,770
No one dares to approach

468
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,710
the lord's treasured items.

469
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,590
Besides, I'm so busy
practicing sword skills

470
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,190
that I haven't cleaned
this place for a while.

471
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,850
That's why it looks desolate.

472
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,490
We haven't met anyone

473
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,030
on our way here. How come?

474
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,850
Everyone in Canglei Palace

475
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,090
must've gone to my father's wedding.

476
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,170
Then why don't you join them?

477
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,710
Daughters aren't usually happy about

478
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,170
their fathers getting remarried, are they?

479
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,070
The old items here

480
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,200
mean a lot to the Heavenly Lord.

481
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,000
I've been keeping them for some time.

482
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,400
Now, I can finally give them

483
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,060
back to their original owner.

484
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,510
Original owner?
