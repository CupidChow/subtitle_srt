[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,950
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,509
I think

4
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,590
Li Muyun may have figured out who I am.

5
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,310
There's a tactic in warfare called
"startling the snake by striking the grass."

6
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,910
He has never seen you before.

7
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,039
Even if he grew suspicious
during the autopsy,

8
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,350
he has no proof.

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,250
But if you really react,

10
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,970
you'll fall into his trap.

11
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,530
I nearly ruined everything
over something so small.

12
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,090
I still lack patience.

13
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,260
You've done very well already.

14
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,530
If it were me,

15
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,199
I might've killed him
on impulse and caused a disaster.

16
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,740
You wouldn't.

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,690
You're the most cautious person I know.

18
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,750
You never do anything
you're not certain about.

19
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,340
But since returning to the capital,

20
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,950
I'm facing more and more uncertainties.

21
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,860
Because of your father?

22
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,770
He won't listen to me.

23
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,590
How can I be certain?

24
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,060
What worries me now

25
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,990
is Prince Jin and Lord Shen's case.

26
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,310
I went to the Ministry of Justice
to find the files,

27
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,910
but they've all been sealed.

28
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,579
It seems this matter

29
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,140
is far more complicated than we imagined.

30
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,180
Today, when I saw

31
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,250
Li Muyun mention my father,

32
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,090
he showed no guilt at all.

33
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,340
I thought he was shameless,

34
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,530
and I was furious.

35
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,820
But now that I think about it,

36
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,970
what if he really has nothing
to be ashamed of?

37
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,320
What if he really just did
what he was supposed to do?

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,450
What if my father...

39
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,530
really did help Prince Jin...

40
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,570
Wan,

41
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,900
stop overthinking it.

42
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,050
We've just returned.

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,370
We need to establish ourselves
in the Ministry of Justice before we can act.

44
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,130
Trust me—

45
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,780
the truth will come out sooner or later.

46
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,940
We'll uncover it,

47
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,410
step

48
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,810
by step.

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,690
Prince Sui can speak now.

50
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,310
Once his mind is more settled,

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,130
I'll ask if he

52
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,329
remembers anything about Consort Jin.

53
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,500
Alright.

54
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,950
Don't think about these things anymore.

55
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,220
You've worked hard these days.
You should get some rest.

56
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,060
The Ministry of Justice prison

57
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,990
isn't exactly a comfortable place
for questioning.

58
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,970
Come on, Your Highness!

59
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,620
Come on! Where are you?

60
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,740
The show is going to begin!

61
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Over here!

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,850
Over here?

63
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,020
I got you!

64
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,060
I'm too tired to play.

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,300
You guys catch me now.

66
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,180
Coming, Sir.

67
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,270
It feels good.

68
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,210
Give my shoulders a massage.

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,140
What's going on?

70
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,030
Weren't you supposed to catch me?

71
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,830
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,659
Why are you crying?

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,080
Which bastard bullied you?

74
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,020
I'll take him down right now!

75
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,060
It was you, you bastard!

76
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,880
I thought you were dead.

77
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,800
How could I be dead?

78
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,920
The other day,

79
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,880
someone was killed at Fengqi House.

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,690
It was a brutal death!

81
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,540
So,

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
you thought it was me?

83
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,670
I've been looking everywhere for you.

84
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,670
I went to Fengqi House
and Prince Yi's Mansion

85
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,250
but couldn't find you.

86
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,060
I heard Chi was investigating the case,

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,400
so I rushed over.

88
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,860
It turned out

89
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,090
Little Wan'er was performing the autopsy.

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,430
The body really looked a lot like you.

91
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,620
It really looked like you.

92
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,540
Even if it wasn't you,

93
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,330
the officer said

94
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,659
the deceased spent every day in brothels.

95
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,890
What if...

96
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,450
the next one is you?

97
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,620
What if you really died?

98
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,740
What am I supposed to do?

99
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,810
If I really die,

100
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,420
I'll make sure you

101
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,000
stand at the front
of my funeral procession.

102
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,300
Fine.

103
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,770
I won't just stand at the front—

104
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,890
I'll perform the rites for you,

105
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,620

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,810
Zhang Dongxuan,

136
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,010
do you want to keep eating
braised lamb knuckles,

137
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,450
or wait here on death row for execution?

138
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,850
I only had one lamb knuckle
and you're already here to settle the score?

139
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,050
Your Highness,
don't you think that's a bit stingy?

140
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,660
As long as you tell me
everything you know,

141
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,520
I promise

142
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,679
you'll have lamb knuckles every day.

143
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,260
So it is a woman!

144
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,230
Your Highness,

145
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,539
am I accurate?

146
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,190
You guessed she was a woman
just because you were told

147
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,000
to wash up before meeting someone—

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,030
assuming only women
care about cleanliness.

149
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,900
Not at all.

150
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,590
It's not just women
who care about cleanliness.

151
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,120
All nobles do.

152
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,060
Besides, it's well known in the capital

153
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,920
that Lord Yan is cold and distant.

154
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,570
The fact that he came specially
to the prison

155
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,790
to order you to clean up
before meeting someone

156
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,900
shows that it must be someone he respects.

157
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,850
And apart from the Empress Dowager,
His Majesty, and Prince Rui,

158
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,660
the only one he'd be
this considerate toward

159
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,260
must be the woman he admires.

160
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,430
Am I right?

161
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,740
Princess Yongci really
lives up to her reputation.

162
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,430
I have another skill too.

163
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,950
Can you guess what it is?

164
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,910
You're even more ruthless

165
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,060
than Lord Yan, little lady!

166
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,120
Mr. Zhang, are you still refusing
to show your true face?

167
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,980
I've relied on this trick
for many years in my travels

168
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,220
without being exposed.

169
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,500
How did you see through it?

170
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,620
You know to use your ears
to locate people by their voices.

171
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,540
But if one pays close attention,

172
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,500
it's obvious you can sense changes
in light and shadow.

173
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,260
I advise you to stop using

174
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,020
this pupil-concealing technique.

175
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,610
It damages the meridians around the eyes.

176
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,410
Over time, it'll harm your vision.

177
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,910
You even know about
the pupil-concealing technique?

178
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,270
The successor of Medicine King Valley

179
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,460
is truly quite something.

180
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,900
Since you know Princess Yongci
comes from Medicine King Valley,

181
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,430
then you should understand

182
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,610
that she is the only one in this world

183
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,140
who can clear your name.

184
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,360
Then you have to tell me

185
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,250
whether the murder scene
of the flaying case in the capital

186
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,700
had the Black Unrighteous Flower symbol.

187
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,210
So far, the crime scene hasn't been found.

188
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,410
But there was a small amount of cinnabar

189
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,710
on the body and where it was dumped.

190
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,380
Are there any other similar cases?

191
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,470
Just this one.

192
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,790
It's similar to the Guanyin Town case.

193
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,210
Only one person has died.

194
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,380
Why did you come to me?

195
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,780
Go now. Leave.

196
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,380
Come back after more people have died.

197
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,310
Zhang Dongxuan,

198
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,980
it's fine if you want to profit from this.

199
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,580
But if you're treating lives like a game,

200
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,040
you'll die in this prison.

201
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,420
You haven't even found the crime scene.

202
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
How can you possibly
catch the real killer?

203
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,210
Besides,

204
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,260
only one person has died.

205
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,090
How is it connected to Guanyin Town?

206
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,850
You have to find a new similar case

207
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,900
to link it to the old one.

208
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,730
Should we just sit back

209
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,610
and wait for innocent people to die?

210
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,850
We must not only investigate the case

211
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,060
but also stop the killings.

212
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,020
Only by knowing
the killer's plan in advance

213
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,950
can we save lives

214
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
instead of just collecting bodies.

215
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,300
Your Highness,

216
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,450
feel free to ask
whatever you want to know.

217
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,310
Six years ago,

218
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,160
why were you involved
in those three cases in Guanyin Town?

219
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,090
Do you know

220
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,810
why Minister Shen believed

221
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,900
I wasn't the real culprit back then?

222
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,350
Because before the murders happened,

223
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,920
I was already practically a broken man.

224
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,280
Your Majesty.

225
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,420
Greetings, Father.

226
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,140
Golden petals with spring cold.

227
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,360
Among yellow flowers are many kinds.

228
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,600
You tell the traveler on the road,

229
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,090
don't mistake the winter jasmine

230
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,390
for the mustard flower.

231
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,490
Very well.

232
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,260
Crown Prince, in your eyes,

233
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,720
who is the winter jasmine,

234
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,090
and who is the mustard flower?

235
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,420
Father,

236
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,690
while walking in the garden today,

237
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,780
I noticed that
among all the flowering trees,

238
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,600
only the winter jasmine
dared to rival the red plum blossoms.

239
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,570
I got inspired for a moment

240
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,370
and wrote an old verse on it.

241
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,490
I didn't think too much of it.

242
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,850
Since you had the leisure

243
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,500
to stroll in the garden,

244
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,860
I assume the horrifying

245
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
flaying case

246
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,420
has been resolved?

247
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,020
Chi and Wan have gone
to investigate under your orders.

248
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,680
Do you know where they are now?

249
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,120
They should still be investigating.

250
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,320
Have you personally read

251
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,380
the case file?

252
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,540
I was planning to do it tomorrow…

253
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,490
Tomorrow again!

254
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,320
What a "tomorrow."

255
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,850
While you were out

256
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,950
enjoying yourself today,

257
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,810
Chi had already found a clue
in the case files.

258
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,590
Right now, he and Wan

259
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,810
are at the Ministry of Justice prison,

260
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,410
interrogating the suspect
from Guanyin Town.

261
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,450
It's...

262
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,450
I...

263
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,310
It's precisely because
you are the Crown Prince

264
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,560
that I entrusted the capital's security

265
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,310
to you.

266
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,850
And now, three major crimes
have happened under your watch,

267
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,610
yet you remain so negligent.

268
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,090
You're truly

269
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,210
unworthy of your title!

270
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,170
Father, please don't be angry.

271
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,140
I was wrong.

272
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,920
If you look down on the task

273
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,210
I gave you that much,

274
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,140
then just stay in the palace

275
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,300
and enjoy being

276
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
a cultured man of leisure.

277
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,360
Father.

278
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,150
Father, I was wrong.

279
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,940
Please give me another chance.

280
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,070
I will certainly be diligent
in my duties from now on.

281
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,670
Your Highness!

282
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,890
You hit the bullseye!

283
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,420
Your Highness, you never miss a shot.

284
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,620
Impressive archery!

285
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,950
Who do you think is better at archery,

286
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,780
me or Yan Chi?

287
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,690
I've never seen Lord Yan shoot.

288
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,980
But when it comes to archery,

289
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,580
you're definitely the best.

290
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,620
This Yan Chi

291
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,300
is the most cunning of all.

292
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,650
Without a real challenge,

293
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,600
it's impossible to gauge
his true abilities.

294
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,210
Your Highness, you don't need to worry.

295
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,050
Soldiers earn respect
through military merit.

296
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,970
Since Lord Yan has been appointed
to the Ministry of Justice,

297
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,210
it won't be long

298
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,660
before he has no place

299
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,040
in Shuoxi Army.

300
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,780
By then,

301
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,300
you will surely

302
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,900
take his place.

303
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,660
Your Highness,
the Noble Consort has sent a message.

304
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,690
Does Aunt have important matters
to tell you?

305
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,540
Tell the messenger I've received it.

306
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,940
Tell my mother not to worry too much

307
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,600
and to take good care of Father.

308
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,290
Yes.

309
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,190
Your Highness.

310
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,060
Aunt is just

311
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,050
worried about you.

312
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,500
The Crown Prince

313
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,430
has been confined by His Majesty.

314
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
His position in the capital prefecture

315
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,490
is probably lost.

316
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,940
Aunt must want you to compete

317
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,450
for the Crown Prince's post
in the capital prefecture.

318
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,180
Women in the harem
only care about that position.

319
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,610
I'm not that foolish.

320
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,690
Father is

321
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,810
sharp, formidable, and in his prime.

322
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,560
If I harbor inappropriate ambitions,

323
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,620
I'd be the first to be dealt with.

324
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,470
But I

325
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,730
underestimated that girl Qin Wan.

326
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,730
Turns out, the expert coroner
who helped the Crown Prince

327
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,190
solve the commoner's case

328
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,230
was her.

329
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,330
Your Highness,

330
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,380
no matter how capable she is,

331
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,950
she's still a woman.

332
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,090
If her reputation is ruined,

333
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,420
would she dare show her face again?

334
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,330
By then,

335
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,010
Yan Chi will naturally lose his support.

336
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,540
Good idea.

337
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,960
But remember,

338
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,140
don't act rashly.

339
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,900
Father and Chi value her highly.

340
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,730
You must find the right moment

341
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,130
before making your move.

342
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,250
Yes.

343
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,900
Qin Wan...

344
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,339
Interesting.

345
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:30,700
Che!

346
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,570
Get out!

347
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

348
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,450
Mother.

349
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,370
I have disappointed you.

350
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,990
You are the Crown Prince of the nation.

351
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,330
You must not speak
such defeatist words so easily.

352
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,060
I'm no longer the Crown Prince.

353
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,940
Father said I'm unworthy of this title

354
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,970
and not fit to be the heir.

355
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,860
Nonsense!

356
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,370
His Majesty only spoke in anger.

357
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,620
He never truly meant to depose you.

358
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,970
Mother,

359
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,160
I've never been

360
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,450
Father's preferred choice
for the Crown Prince.

361
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,050
If it weren't for protocol,

362
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,940
he would have deposed me long ago.

363
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
There's no "if."

364
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,580
You are the legitimate son of the Empress.

365
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,970
By birth and by right,

366
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,100
the Crown Prince title belongs to you.

367
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,850
As long as you fulfill your duties,

368
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,000
no one can seize your position—

369
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,420
not even your father.

370
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,010
Mother,

371
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,490
rather than letting Father

372
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,530
be disappointed time and again,

373
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,660
why don't we take this chance

374
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,490
to step down gracefully?

375
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,140
I...

376
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,380
Did it hurt?

377
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,900
I truly don't like these duties.

378
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,000
But

379
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,770
ever since you were born,

380
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,050
you've had no choice in this.

381
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,660
You think that not being the Crown Prince

382
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,860
means you can live as a carefree prince?

383
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:12,940
Throughout history,

384
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,270
deposed crown princes have only one fate—

385
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,580
death.

386
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,820
I don't want to hear this!

387
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,490
Very well.

388
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,430
You don't want to be the Crown Prince,
huh?

389
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:33,690
Here.

390
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,100
Mother, what are you doing?

391
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,180
Kill me first.

392
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,290
Are you crazy?

393
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:39,940
Do it!

394
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,970
Do it!

395
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,940
Mother!

396
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,750
Have you lost your mind?

397
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,140
Mother.

398
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,990
You can't do it, can you?

399
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,290
Then focus on being the Crown Prince

400
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,040
until the day you ascend the throne!

401
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,350
For the sake of the people,

402
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,290
you must take that position!

403
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,420
On the Double Third Festival,
we'll arrange a marriage for you.

404
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,210
Before then,

405
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,840
His Majesty will surely
lift your confinement.

406
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,370
Just focus on doing your job well.

407
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,140
Don't cause another scandal

408
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,400
that hands others leverage against you.

409
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,050
Yes, Mother.

410
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,900
The tissue around his wound
has severely contracted,

411
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,300
restricting blood flow.

412
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,660
His left chest muscle
has already atrophied—

413
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,120
it's been over five years.

414
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,860
I had this scar when I was arrested.

415
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,620
It's clearly recorded in the case file,

416
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,820
yet they still

417
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,100
locked me up as the killer.

418
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
With a scar that deep and long,

419
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,140
the damage has already reached
the nerves in his left arm.

420
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
There's no way he could carry out

421
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,840
such a complex method of murder
as skinning someone alive.

422
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,400
What if he only planned it,

423
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,690
and someone else did the killing?

424
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,350
What do you mean, little brat?

425
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,860
You treated me well, fed me nice food,

426
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,250
and promised to clear my name.

427
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,010
Now that you've seen my scar,

428
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,010
you're making up some story

429
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,450
about me having an accomplice?

430
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,340
If you're innocent,
why did you pretend to be blind?

431
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,050
If I don't pretend to be blind,

432
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,180
how could anyone believe I could see fate?

433
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,380
How would I make a living?

434
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,660
Then why did you keep pretending
after you were

435
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
thrown in
the Ministry of Justice prison?

436
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,210
Even blind,

437
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,010
I was regarded as a suspect.

438
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,290
If I could see,

439
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,620
wouldn't that make me even less credible?

440
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,620
So Lord Shen only agreed
to reopen your case

441
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,020
because you tricked him.

442
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,570
Nonsense!

443
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,940
Minister Shen has a keen eye for detail.

444
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,420
He questioned me because he found

445
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,490
inconsistencies

446
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,380
in the case file.

447
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,010
He even went to Guanyin Town himself
to investigate.

448
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,250
After confirming what I said,

449
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,290
he declared the case inconclusive.

450
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,290
Go read

451
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,970
his notes yourself—

452
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,050
or stop bothering me.

453
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,790
Unfortunately,

454
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,110
all the records he personally wrote
have disappeared.

455
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,290
No one knows what he discovered
in Guanyin Town,

456
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,040
or why

457
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,180
he labeled your case unresolved.

458
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,620
So that means

459
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,620
only by finding the real culprit
behind the capital's flaying case

460
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,020
can we reopen
the Guanyin Town murder case.

461
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,530
If you help us catch the real killer,

462
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,760
I will certainly clear your name.

463
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,010
Do you know

464
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,500
why I was considered

465
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,570
a suspect in the first place?

466
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,720
According to the previous files,

467
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,290
all three victims
in the Guanyin Town murder case

468
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,100
once came to you for fortune-telling.

469
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,860
Yes.

470
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,620
I never imagined

471
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,240
it would all lead to such a disaster.

472
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,970
Five years ago, I was setting up
a stall beside a temple

473
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,420
when I witnessed two brothers
quarrel with a pilgrim.

474
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,210
I didn't expect the younger brother
would get injured

475
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,900
and become paralyzed on one side.

476
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,140
Later, when I visited him,

477
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,580
I found his elder brother

478
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,790
had seized all his property.

479
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,750
I advised the elder brother to remember
their brotherly bond,

480
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,330
but he was angered
that I had exposed his scheme

481
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,680
and threw me out.

482
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,800
How dare you hit me!

483
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,660
So what?

484
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,100
Looking for trouble, are you?

485
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,860
Beat him!

486
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,450
Beat him!

487
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,050
Don't run!

488
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,900
A few days later,

489
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,490
the elder brother was found
skinned and dumped

490
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,210
right outside my hut.

491
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,660
I fled the temple that night

492
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,320
and moved to the countryside.

493
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
His death had nothing to do with you,

494
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
so why did you run?

495
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,450
Do the case files

496
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,770
mention

497
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,470
the Heavenly Way Society?

498
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,450
Yes.

499
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,480
The registrar of Guanyin Town

500
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,280
specifically noted in the files

501
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,690
that except for you,

502
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,090
no one knew about
the Heavenly Way Society.

503
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,380
Just as I thought.

504
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,010
What exactly is this Heavenly Way Society?

505
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,820
The Heavenly Way Society's name means
"acting on behalf of Heaven's justice."

506
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,340
They punish the wicked and eliminate evil.

507
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,860
Members must swear a blood oath
to join it,

508
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,210
vowing to rid the world

509
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,530
of all evil and injustice

510
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,590
in their lifetime.

511
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,290
To quit,

512
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,940
one must cut out a piece
of their own heart flesh

513
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,340
as atonement for breaking the oath

514
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,290
before leaving.

515
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,180
So the wound on your chest

516
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,390
was from leaving the society?

517
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,620
It's all my own doing.

518
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,200
I thought giving up

519
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,010
that bit of flesh would set me free.

520
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,210
But when I saw how
that elder brother died,

521
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,900
I knew he was targeted

522
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,730
by the Heavenly Way Society because of me.

523
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,780
For the crime of sowing discord among kin,

524
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,980
they sentenced him to be skinned alive.

525
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,620
Leaving his body at my hut's door

526
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,980
was a warning

527
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,460
not to reveal anything
about the Heavenly Way Society.

528
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,780
Only the law

529
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,010
has the right to punish crimes.

530
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,220
What right does the Heavenly Way Society
have to abuse private justice?

531
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,460
When I was young,
how could I understand such things?

532
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,890
My family was once quite wealthy,

533
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,900
until a rich man

534
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,830
set his eyes on our stationery shop

535
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,140
and, with a gang of thugs,

536
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,110
brutally beat my father to death

537
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,550
and forced my mother

538
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,100
to hang herself with a hemp rope.

539
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,010
Why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

540
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,610
I did.

541
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,880
I spent all my money bribing officials.

542
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,640
But in the end,
they said there was no evidence

543
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,830
and accused me of false charges.

544
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,620
Turns out that rich man had already

545
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,500
bought off everyone in the county office.

546
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,340
Justice may be slow,

547
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,820
but it never fails.

548
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,110
Such corrupt officials

549
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,140
will be wiped out sooner or later.

550
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,140
Young lady,

551
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,530
what you said is just like

552
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,100
Minister Shen's.

553
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,480
Young lady?

554
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,300
You should respectfully
call her Master Wan.

555
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,860
Even Minister Shen

556
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,420
never asked me to call him Master.

557
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,900
You must really have some skills

558
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,960
to earn

559
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,730
that title.

560
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,050
Alright.

561
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,140
You don't seem like someone
who would just sit and wait for death.

562
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,050
So why did you let that rich man
turn the tables on you without doing anything?

563
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,950
I had no other choice then.

564
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,770
Just as I was about to flee,

565
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,450
I met an old man

566
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,940
who said if I wanted revenge,

567
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,070
I should follow him.

568
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,050
Filled with anger, I blindly

569
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,770
joined the Heavenly Way Society.

570
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,970
I thought it was just a society
like the canal workers' union,

571
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,910
but it turned out

572
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,360
they train assassins

573
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,490
who kill

574
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,090
according to their own laws.

575
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
The Heavenly Way Society is strict.

576
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,250
Except for the old man who introduced me,

577
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,850
I've never seen anyone's real face

578
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,970
or known the exact location of their hall.

579
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,350
After I woke up,

580
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,700
I kept thinking about how to escape

581
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,820
this deadly hellhole.

582
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,060
The elder who recommended me
was kind-hearted

583
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,340
and told me about

584
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,630
the flesh-cutting rule
for leaving the society.

585
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,450
But it wasn't until the day I left

586
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,470
that I realized

587
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,730
he had to

588
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,820
cut out a piece of his own heart too.

589
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,390
Mr. Zhang, thank you for today.

590
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,100
The jailer will bring you
some sweet soup later.

591
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,560
Drink it and get some rest.

592
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,220
Flaying skin and pulling tongues?

593
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,750
Could they really

594
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,930
have reached the capital?

595
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,860
Is it good?

596
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,210
Yes.

597
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,530
From now on, we'll buy it from this place.

598
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:02,920
Okay.

599
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,850
Wait.

600
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,140
Master, Your Highness.

601
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,730
Tonight I want to stay at your residence.

602
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,820
At my place?

603
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,530
I can't go back to the palace now.

604
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,940
If I return to
the Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion,

605
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,870
I'll probably be questioned again.

606
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,770
Staying at your place

607
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,300
won't cause gossip, right?

608
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,690
No.

609
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,660
Our mansion has a second gate.

610
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,650
The carriage can go straight there.

611
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,180
No one will know you're with me.

612
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,670
No, no, absolutely not!

613
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,770
Our princess is a young maiden.

614
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,770
How could she casually
stay at a man's house?

615
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,580
Her reputation is more precious
than Mount Tai.

616
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,970
It must not be tarnished in the slightest.

617
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,050
Lives are more precious than Mount Tai.

618
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,450
Constable Zhan is investigating

619
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,490
the victim's identity.

620
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,810
Please tell him

621
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,570
to focus on families
with brotherly conflicts.

622
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,140
Yes.

623
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,010
Also,

624
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,270
When you come back,
bring two bowls of wonton

625
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,670
for Princess Yongci as a late-night snack.

626
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:29,900
Fuling,

627
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,550
your reputation

628
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,320
is just as important
in Princess Yongci's eyes.

629
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,940
I'll go get the horses ready.

630
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,720
This guy is even smoother than I am.

631
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,540
Today we have some good news.

632
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,280
Our Fuling's marriage

633
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,770
has finally been settled.

634
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,180
He wants me to agree to marry him
just over a bowl of wonton?

635
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,420
That's too easy.

636
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,010
Let's go.

637
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:03,900
Look.

638
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,620
Your clothes are way too big for me.

639
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,250
It's fine.

640
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,320
You look good in anything.

641
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,620
From now on,
I'll keep two sets of clothes for you

642
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,280
so you can change when needed.

643
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,530
If I often stay out overnight,

644
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,690
won't the Marquis Mansion go crazy?

645
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,540
Then ask His Majesty
to grant you a residence.

646
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,060
It would be convenient
for your future investigations too.

647
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,180
How could I

648
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,230
trouble His Majesty
for such a small matter?

649
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,180
Actually,

650
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,150
I do have a place in mind.

651
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,020
Where is it? I'll buy it for you.

652
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,490
I want to move into Uncle Liang's house.

653
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,200
It's close to my old family home.

654
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,490
I can look for Father's old notes

655
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,460
and pay respects to my parents.

656
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,180
Alright.

657
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,620
I'll have someone

658
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,750
start packing and help you move later.

659
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,640
-Little Wan'er!
-Chi!

660
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,790
Retreat, retreat.

661
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,090
Let me see.

662
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,050
Why are you pulling me?

663
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,900
Do you know
what it means to be inseparable?

664
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,240
Of course I do.

665
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,590
I wasn't trying to tear them apart.

666
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,070
Your Ladyship? Your Highness?

667
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,340
This is for Little Wan'er, right?

668
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,400
I'll send it to her.

669
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,450
Aren't you asking for trouble
if you go now?

670
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,820
What's wrong with delivering some food?

671
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,550
Give it to me.

672
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,490
This...

673
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,010
Oh my goodness.

674
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,760
Three.

675
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,900
Two.

676
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,310
One.

677
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,100
I haven't finished my bowl of wontons yet!

678
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,530
That bowl of wontons
you ate was actually mine.

679
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,040
I told you not to go in,

680
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,690
but you wouldn't listen.

681
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,210
You...

682
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,380
I haven't had time for you lately,

683
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,010
so you took Yue Ning

684
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,810
to hang out at Fengqi House, huh?

685
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,890
Ning, back me up here.

686
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,570
Today I did you a huge favor.

687
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,690
If it weren't for me,

688
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,950
how could Constable Zhan
have found the victim so quickly?

689
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,480
That's true.

690
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,960
He was really impressive today.

691
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,140
The moment I said we still didn't know
who the victim was,

692
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,900
he immediately took me to Fengqi House.

693
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,010
With just a few words, he got the madam

694
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,010
to list all the guests from that day.

695
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,970
While we were trying to decide
which one to investigate first,

696
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,010
Bai Feng said we should focus on people

697
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,060
with conflicts between brothers.

698
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,090
I instantly picked out the name.

699
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,620
So who is it?

700
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,690
Wu Qian, the fourth young master

701
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,620
of the Earl of Weiyuan's household.

702
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,140
The Earl of Weiyuan's household
is basically broke now.

703
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,730
How could Wu Qian have the money

704
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,260
to splurge at Fengqi House?

705
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,970
He might not have money,
but the family still has some assets.

706
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,450
Wu Qian is the Earl of Weiyuan's son
from his later years.

707
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,690
He's the least capable

708
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,140
but the most spoiled.

709
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,660
First he pawned antiques and paintings,

710
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,140
then got obsessed with stone seals.

711
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,750
In the end, he sold off a few shops

712
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,900
and even framed

713
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,370
the Third Young Master Wu Yu

714
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,260
for embezzling family property,

715
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
nearly causing the family to split.

716
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,990
The Marquis of Weiyuan's Mansion?

717
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,530
A few days ago,
there was a murder case in the capital.

718
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,130
Wu Qian from your family was seen

719
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,820
at the crime scene.

720
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,530
We had a sketch made,

721
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,010
and it matches him closely.

722
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,900
Are you referring to the flaying case

723
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,159
that's caused widespread panic lately?

724
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,190
Precisely.

725
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,670
The corpse was badly damaged,

726
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,199
making it hard to identify.

727
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,739
So we had to investigate Wu Qian

728
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,600
based on his recent whereabouts.

729
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,750
But this also ties into

730
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,179
the rumors about discord
between you two brothers.

731
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,270
My brother and I quarreled only because,

732
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,460
while Father was gravely ill, he dared

733
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,570
to persuade Mother to sell off her dowry
to fund his extravagance.

734
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,500
I punished him on behalf of Father,

735
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,170
but Mother defended him.

736
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,830
He claimed he wanted
to start a stone seal business,

737
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:58,159
but

738
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,170
people from Ranmo Gallery
came after him for debts.

739
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,650
Not only did he fail to make any money,

740
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,050
he ended up owing
a hundred taels of silver.

741
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,650
His outrageous reputation is well known.

742
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,310
Why would Ranmo Gallery
still do business with him?

743
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,580
I never interfere in his affairs.

744
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,160
[Ranmo Gallery]

745
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,630
Please have a seat.

746
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,570
Your Highness, feel free to ask anything.

747
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,700
I will tell you everything I know.

748
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,700
Mr. Ning, do you know my fourth brother,

749
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,340
Wu Qian?

750
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,420
Of course I do.

751
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,820
Fourth Young Master Wu
is a regular at Ranmo Gallery.

752
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,190
That day,

753
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,610
the authorities asked me to paint
a portrait of a deceased person...

754
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,410
That's right.

755
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,450
The deceased was my fourth brother.

756
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,700
I want to ask you—

757
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,220
do you think my fourth brother
was a trustworthy person?

758
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,450
It's more accurate to say
that Fourth Young Master Wu

759
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,980
thought I was trustworthy,

760
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,490
which is why he entrusted
your family's paintings

761
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,750
to me for safekeeping.

762
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,700
No need to cover for my brother.

763
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:57,900
I know

764
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,650
he often secretly sold my family's
calligraphy and paintings to you.

765
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,700
The other day, one of your shop's clerks
came looking for payment,

766
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,260
saying my brother
owed you 100 taels of silver.

767
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,490
Is this true?

768
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,260
Impossible.

769
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,530
Given Fourth Young Master Wu's character,

770
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,970
we always settled accounts in full—

771
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,820
no credit.

772
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,010
Could you please call

773
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,610
all your shop clerks here,

774
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,530
so Third Young Master Wu can identify

775
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,330
the person who came for the debt?

776
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,540
Call everyone over.

777
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,650
Here.

778
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,650
Please.

779
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,200
Thank you.

780
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,420
Our studio

781
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,940
only has two painters, two apprentices,

782
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,480
and one errand boy.

783
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,610
The person who came for the debt
that day isn't here.

784
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,380
Mr. Ning,

785
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,410
have you ever employed anyone else before?

786
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,260
Yes.

787
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,570
Third Young Master Wu, take a look.

788
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,630
Is this the person?

789
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,000
That's him.

790
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,120
This person

791
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,220
was our studio's carver, Wang Xin.

792
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,250
But I discovered

793
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,490
he was secretly forging
noble seals for profit.

794
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,740
Because of his misconduct,

795
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,780
I fired him a month ago.

796
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,310
Could it be that

797
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,570
my fourth brother's
so-called stone seal business

798
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,630
was actually selling counterfeit seals
with Wang Xin?

799
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,140
Anyone who can run
such a fake seal business

800
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,480
must have excellent carving skills.

801
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,610
Putting aside artistic flair and spirit,

802
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,870
his carving technique

803
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,030
is indeed very good.

804
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,970
The night Wang Xin went
to collect his debt,

805
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,900
Fourth Young Master Wu got killed.

806
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,260
And he had a financial dispute with him.

807
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,460
He is a prime suspect.

808
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,420
I had this portrait made

809
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,750
specifically to issue an arrest warrant.

810
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,710
I'm hungry.

811
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,900
We've made good progress today.

812
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,010
I'll take you a place.

813
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,540

How do you know so much about everything?

836
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,220
I joined Shuoxi Army when I was eight.

837
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,420
My father just left me at the camp

838
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,820
and paid me no attention.

839
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,180
On the battlefield,

840
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,090
no one treated me as a child.

841
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,820
I had to learn how to survive.

842
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,220
You must have had a tough childhood,
right?

843
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,360
Before I was eight,

844
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,470
I was raised
in the Empress Dowager's palace.

845
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,560
Though without my parents' care,

846
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,650
I had my Grandmother's protection.

847
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,050
It wasn't too harsh.

848
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,820
The real hardships began

849
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,070
when I went to my father's side.

850
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,140
My mother's nanny told me

851
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,130
that when she was alive,

852
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,780
this was her favorite place.

853
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,570
Whenever my father missed my mother,

854
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,630
he would come here.

855
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,950
After I learned about this,

856
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
I often came here

857
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,610
to sit and imagine

858
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,860
what my mother

859
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,530
looked like

860
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,940
standing here.

861
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,700
How did your mother pass away?

862
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,070
The nanny said

863
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,680
my mother suffered a hemorrhage

864
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,760
giving birth to me

865
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,880
and lingered for over a month
before passing.

866
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,470
At that time,
my father was on the way back to the capital.

867
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,730
By the time he arrived,

868
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,980
she had already been buried.

869
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,610
Given your mother's rank,

870
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,530
her body should have lain
in state for several months.

871
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,190
Why was she buried so quickly?

872
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,510
I don't know.

873
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,130
No one ever mentioned it.

874
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,200
Thinking about it, it does seem strange.

875
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Not necessarily.

876
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,880
With Prince Rui's temper,

877
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,130
if something was wrong,

878
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,860
he would have investigated it.

879
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,180
In the end, my father

880
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,940
stayed by my mother's tomb
for three months.

881
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,650
Then he handed me,
swaddled, over to the Empress Dowager

882
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,980
and returned to Shuoxi.

883
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,440
The nanny said that

884
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,450
because Father

885
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,510
never got to see Mother one last time,

886
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,840
his heart seemed as if it had died.

887
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,420
Perhaps that's why

888
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,980
he somewhat blames me for it.

889
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,720
But I don't blame him.

890
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,150
Your mother's death
had nothing to do with you.

891
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,510
One day your father will understand.

892
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,410
You are the most innocent

893
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,070
and the one who needs his love the most.

894
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,050
Having you by my side

895
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,060
is enough for me.

896
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,260
Well,

897
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,620
skinning, tongue-pulling,
freezing to death—

898
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,650
does the Heavenly Way Society
follow any rules for punishment?

899
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,380
Or do they just torture
and kill people at random?

900
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,840
What?

901
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,820
The postmortem reports
of the three victims in Guanyin Town

902
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,780
have clearly stated their causes of death,

903
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,640
but I still can't find
any connection between them.

904
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,900
The reports
are still at the capital prefecture.

905
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,610
Let's head there immediately.

906
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,170
We can also have Zheng Baishi
step up the patrols.

907
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:43,700
Let's go.

908
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,050
What's wrong?

909
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,820
You specifically brought me here to relax,

910
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,870
yet all I can think about is the case.

911
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,230
Do you think I'm unromantic?

912
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,620
How could I be such a narrow-minded
and ordinary person?

913
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,730
Remember,

914
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,720
this is your unique charm.

915
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,300
In this world,

916
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,980
no one but me, Yan Chi,

917
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,930
can truly appreciate it.

918
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

919
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,010
Thank you for your hard work,
Your Highness.
