[Episode 8]

3
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,590
We are demon hunters.

4
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,640
Is this the residence of Xu Ying?

5
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,210
My name is Sun Ya.

6
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,190
My husband Xu Ying and I
were childhood sweethearts.

7
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,970
We've been married for
over a decade now.

8
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,130
He'd always been fond of drinking.

9
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,250
He just wouldn't listen to me.

10
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,470
That night, he didn't come home at all.

11
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,800
I thought he had
passed out drunk somewhere.

12
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,730
But I never imagined...

13
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,190
At dawn, someone found

14
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,650
his body outside the city.

15
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,980
Was it done by Honglian?

16
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,840
Where did he usually drink?

17
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,710
Lanyue House.

18
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,250
Is it a restaurant?

19
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,710
Lanyue House is Songhe County's
largest brothel.

20
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,380
Since you two are demon hunters,

21
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,920
you must catch that heart-digging demon

22
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,630
and avenge my husband.

23
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,280
Madam Sun, please accept our condolences.

24
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,730
If there really is a demon harming people,

25
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,060
we will certainly eliminate this threat.

26
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,000
My husband,

27
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,520
did you hear that?

28
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,750
Come, come, this way, this way.

29
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,310
Sir,

30
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
your dishes are here.

31
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,070
Then let's have a few drinks together.

32
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,470
-Don't run.
-Oh, stop it.

33
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,270
Stop hiding.

34
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,390
You're hurting me.

35
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,780
Follow me.

36
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,090
Wasn't there talk of demon activity?

37
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,590
Why are the streets
so empty during the day,

38
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,900
while Lanyue House is so busy at night?

39
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,480
Naturally, there's something here

40
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,880
that makes people want to
come at all costs.

41
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,310
Bravo!

42
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,800
Do you think Xu Ying was

43
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,350
really killed by Honglian?

44
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,420
Why does she dig out people's hearts?

45
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Do you know Honglian's background?

46
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,070
I don't.

47
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,610
She was a lotus that grew
by the Naihe Bridge,

48
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,310
absorbing the grievances
of countless wandering souls.

49
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,240
So when she took human form,
she carried evil energy.

50
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,520
On every full moon,

51
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,820
the evil energy in her body surges,

52
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,070
bringing heart-piercing pain.

53
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,540
She can only suppress the pain
by eating human hearts.

54
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,090
Is there no way to dissolve
this evil energy?

55
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,520
There is a way but also no way.

56
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,250
What do you mean?

57
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,750
Bravo!

58
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,780
[Honglian]

59
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,600
Is it her?

60
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,980
What are we waiting for then?

61
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,970
This is a clone.
Catching it is useless.

62
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,620
Sit down.

63
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,950
A clone?

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,010
Then where is her real body?

65
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,040
She was suppressed for centuries.

66
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,060
When she escaped,
she was severely injured.

67
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,900
To control this puppet clone,

68
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,390
she must be nearby.

69
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,720
You can't detect where her
real body is either?

70
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,720
She has lived for nearly a thousand years.

71
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,980
Naturally, she has ways to hide herself.

72
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,510
So the Heavenly Lord isn't as
powerful as I thought.

73
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,510
Bravo!

74
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,940
-So beautiful!
-She danced so well.

75
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,090
Miss Lian,

76
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,680
this is my family's heirloom white jade.

77
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,390
Please see if it meets your standards.

78
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,070
Miss Lian,

79
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,600
this is a night-luminous pearl
I bought at a high price.

80
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,100
This is agarwood worth a fortune.

81
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,409
I don't want your jewels.

82
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,190
What I want is your love.

83
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,540
I've never been here before.

84
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,510
Is she really that beautiful?

85
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,060
I'm the one who truly likes Miss Lian.

86
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,260
Honglian is best at
bewitching people.

87
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,080
Have you ever been bewitched by her?

88
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,700
Miss Lian, Miss Lian!

89
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,110
Don't listen to their nonsense.

90
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,040
Don't listen to his lies.

91
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,190
They're all a bunch of lechers.

92
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,390
Miss Lian, Miss Lian!

93
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,370
Look at mine!

94
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,140
-Look at mine.
-Take a look.

95
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,800
Look, please!

96
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,230
Miss Lian, Miss Lian!

97
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,510
Cut it out.

98
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,940
I know what kind of person you are.

99
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,240
What are you holding there?

100
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,070
How can that compare to mine?

101
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,120
These two gentlemen look unfamiliar.

102
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,950
I've long heard of Miss Lian's reputation.

103
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,010
We've come here because of your fame.

104
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,960
This young gentleman

105
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,240
is so handsome.

106
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
Among all these people...

107
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,870
Miss Lian!

108
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,040
You're the only one who catches my eye.

109
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,240
I wonder if you'd like

110
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,420
to join me upstairs for a drink?

111
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,920
But what about the gift
I spent so long to prepare?

112
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,930
Yeah.

113
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,880
Then I'll respectfully
accept your invitation.

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,890
Wait for me here.

115
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,110
Hey, this...

116
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,150
Miss Lian is leaving.

117
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,960
Miss Lian!

118
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,460
-Miss Lian!
-Miss Lian!

119
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,350
Look at us.

120
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,600
Miss Lian!

121
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,140
Miss Lian!

122
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,430
You're indeed popular.

123
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,310
Everything in this room is valuable.

124
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,240
These things

125
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,760
can't be taken with when I pass away.

126
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,720
Nothing is as precious as sincere hearts.

127
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
Come, let's have a drink.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,730
It seems you are very interested
in human hearts.

129
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,360
It's not that I like it.

130
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,560
It's just so hard to find in this world.

131
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,950
That's why it seems even more precious.

132
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,270
You came here

133
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,440
just to find a sincere heart?

134
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm waiting for someone.

135
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,390
Who?

136
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,170
Waiting for someone who doesn't love me.

137
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
If you meet him,

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,920
could you ask him to come find me?

139
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,920
What did she tell you?

140
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
She said she's waiting for someone.

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,820
Do you know who she's waiting for?

142
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,000
I do.

143
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,550
Then let's bring him here.

144
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,880
Maybe it could help us catch Honglian.

145
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,070
He doesn't want to see her.

146
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,330
How can we force him
to do something he doesn't want to?

147
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,970
Then what should we do?

148
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,870
Are we just going to wait for Honglian
to make the first move?

149
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,000
What if she escapes?

150
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,560
I've already set up a barrier around
the entire Songhe County.

151
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,090
She won't be able to escape.

152
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,180
What should we do next?

153
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,720
Wait.

154
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,080
Wait?

155
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,080
She's unwilling to appear.

156
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,930
And we can't find her true form.

157
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,850
Let's see who gets restless first.

158
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,860
But come to think of it,

159
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm curious.

160
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,320
What exactly did Honglian do back then

161
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,000
to get sealed in Hell Ruins?

162
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,360
Honglian,

163
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,300
you spread a plague
and took countless lives.

164
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,510
Surrender now!

165
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,690
Have him come see me.

166
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,550
Incorrigible.

167
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,080
It's your memories again.

168
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,650
You haven't told me yet

169
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,360
who the person is that Honglian mentioned.

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,600
Li Mo.

171
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,080
One of your Three Dharma Lords?

172
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,750
Good memory.

173
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,170
If that's the case,

174
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,640
then this matter began with him,

175
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,970
and should end with him.

176
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,880
Foolish girl, he doesn't love you at all.

177
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,510
Who?

178
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,170
You know clearly that he doesn't love you.

179
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,030
It's not like we're
meeting for the first time.

180
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,760
Why are you still so surprised?

181
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,440
Stop looking around.
This is an illusion I created.

182
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,600
Without my permission,

183
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,270
no one can enter or leave.

184
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,520
Why did you bring me here?

185
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,080
Why don't you guess?

186
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,410
You want to force Li Mo to show up.

187
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,660
You're quite clever.

188
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,100
Have a seat first.

189
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,490
I heard Li Mo has been
avoiding you for centuries.

190
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,020
Are you sure he will come?

191
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,720
That depends on how important
you are to Bai Jiusi.

192
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,810
Let's see if he will

193
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,270
force his disciple to meet me
for your sake.

194
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,190
If he refuses,

195
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,370
that's fine too.

196
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,480
At least I will have helped you
see his true colors.

197
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,030
He will.

198
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,280
Oh, you still don't understand men.

199
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,440
Even though he keeps saying he loves you,

200
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,790
it might not be true.

201
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,099
I have lived for a thousand years.

202
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,720
I've seen people's cold-heartedness

203
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:30,750
and false affections.

204
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Not all men are like that.

205
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,410
Do you know what this is?

206
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,619
Evil energy.

207
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,270
It seems Bai Jiusi has
told you about this.

208
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,830
It's this evil energy

209
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,690
that torments me every full moon,

210
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,110
making me wish I were dead.

211
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,030
Meng Po on the Naihe Bridge told me

212
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,070
only the blood of someone
who truly loves me

213
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,640
can dissolve the evil energy in my body.

214
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,880
Unfortunately, I've waited
for a thousand years,

215
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
and this evil energy
still hasn't been removed.

216
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,200
Can you guess why?

217
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,550
Perhaps I should let you see for yourself.

218
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,880
Then you'll understand.

219
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,030
We grew up together.

220
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,070
We're also at the age for marriage.

221
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,470
I've already discussed it with my parents.

222
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,040
As long as you don't mind me,

223
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,890
tomorrow...

224
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,790
I'll go to your house tomorrow to propose.

225
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,200
Alright.

226
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,410
Lian, does this mean you've agreed?

227
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,240
That's wonderful!

228
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,170
Lian has agreed to marry me!

229
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,580
Lian has agreed to marry me!

230
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,200
That's wonderful!

231
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,150
What do you want me to see?

232
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,900
What is this now?

233
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,110
Naturally, it's still my past.

234
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,450
Who's there? Who's knocking?

235
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,140
Wake up, wake up.

236
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,060
Miss Honglian, thank you
for saving my life.

237
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,830
When I pass the imperial exam,
I will return to marry you.

238
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,830
I'll wait for you.

239
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,880
Lian!

240
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,080
Lian, I've come back to marry you.

241
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,560
Enough!

242
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,110
Do you see clearly now?

243
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,160
Whether it's childhood sweethearts
or life-saving grace,

244
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,590
sharing life and death,

245
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,170
or kindred spirits,

246
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,400
they're all fake.

247
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,480
They pride themselves on being passionate,

248
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
but in the end,

249
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,230
not one of them could dispel
the evil energy in me.

250
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,830
Isn't it laughable?

251
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,810
You killed them.

252
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,750
I didn't take their lives.

253
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,470
I only took the blood from their hearts.

254
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,240
Since you're convinced
that men are fickle,

255
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,100
why do you insist on finding Li Mo?

256
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,890
He's different.

257
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,870
How is he different?

258
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,920
He doesn't love me.

259
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,510
He's the only one who doesn't love me.

260
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,750
Then why do you still insist
on finding him?

261
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,510
It's me.

262
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,540
I'm holding onto a love I can't reach.

263
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I deserve an explanation, don't I?

264
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,160
Alright, someone's here to see me.

265
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,120
I will play with you no more.

266
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,240
My dear sister,

267
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,160
I'll help you test

268
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,550
Bai Jiusi's true feelings for you.

269
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,210
How's that?

270
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,280
What are you going to do? Let me out!

271
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,720
Don't go! Come back!

272
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,750
Let me out!

273
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,960
This is nothing but a puppet's shell.

274
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
You can't hurt me.

275
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,600
If you want to kill me,

276
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,490
then just do it.

277
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,240
Where is she?

278
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,490
Hand over Li Mo in exchange.

279
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,980
If you want to see him,

280
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,740
come and see me in person.

281
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,440
Do you think I'm stupid?

282
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,740
If it were my real body

283
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,340
standing in front of you,

284
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,030
how would I even have the right

285
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,030
to bargain with you here?

286
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,130
How about this?

287
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,870
I've heard that disciples must obey

288
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,920
Blood Spells from Canglei Palace.

289
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,240
As long as you issue an order to Li Mo,

290
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,590
I'll tell you Li Qingyue's location.

291
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,050
Well?

292
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,430
Location.

293
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,220
Li Qingyue is inside.

294
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,710
But let me kindly remind you.

295
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,470
It might be easy to enter,
but getting out might be difficult.

296
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,720
That's right, this is the trap I set.

297
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,920
Do you still dare to enter?

298
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,580
This is getting more and more interesting.

299
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,710
Heavenly Lord.

300
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,720
Heavenly Lord!

301
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,640
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one!

302
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,500
Heavenly Lord!

303
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,030
Heavenly Lord.

304
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,280
Only one of them is real.

305
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,880
Bai Jiusi, you only have one chance.

306
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,000
They are all fake!

307
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,530
If you choose the wrong one,

308
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,160
this little girl...

309
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,400
will be sealed in ice forever.

310
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,160
By then, even the Heavenly Emissary

311
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,410
will not be able to save her.

312
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,750
-Heavenly Lord!
-Heavenly Lord!

313
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,590
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one!

314
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,830
I'm the real one. Don't listen
to their nonsense.

315
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,790
I'm the real one!

316
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,650
Heavenly Lord!

317
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,790
I'm Qingyue, Heavenly Lord.

318
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,350
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one.

319
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,080
Heavenly Lord! Heavenly Lord!

320
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,530
They are all fake!

321
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,750
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one.

322
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,550
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one!

323
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,500
Heavenly Lord!

324
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,590
Heavenly Lord, look at me!

325
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,350

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:29,090
♪ Looking back, yesterday's moss still faintly remains ♪

339
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,950
I knew you cared for me the most.

340
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,810
♪ Our love and hate are no longer the same ♪

341
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:48,040
♪ Only the twin flowers in the pond remain ♪

342
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,840
Such profound and deeply touching affection.

343
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,900
If that's the case,

344
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,730
I won't disturb you two lovebirds any longer.

345
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,290
You must not leave!

346
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,770
You have to let us out!

347
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,960
Once I see Li Mo,

348
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,720
I'll naturally let you go.

349
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,290
What if he never comes?

350
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,790
Do you plan to keep us locked up forever?

351
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,540
Say something!

352
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,480
Heavenly Lord, do you have a way out?

353
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,360
No.

354
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,570
Then what should we do?

355
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,070
Just stay put.

356
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Heavenly Lord, am I holding you back again?

357
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,560
It's fine.

358
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,240
Palm Flame Ignition, go!

359
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,460
Palm Flame Ignition, go!

360
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,380
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

361
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
How do you know how to play this tune?

362
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,610
Are you a disciple of Jingyun Sect?

363
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,320
How is Mr. Meng doing?

364
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,520
I mean no harm.

365
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,500
I came here secretly because
I have a favor to ask.

366
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,190
Senior Meng said you would understand
after reading this letter.

367
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,530
[Xingman, Zhang Suan is my fellow junior disciple. He has always respected me deeply
and has stayed clear of disputes within the sect.]

368
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,680
You want to ascend to the Nine Heavens?

369
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,440
Yes.

370
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,790
Follow me.

371
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,920
Yinlian Mountain is the sacred ground
of our sect.

372
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,240
It's said to have originated at
the dawn of chaos,

373
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,240
connecting heaven and earth,
and can reach even Hell.

374
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,400
The first master of our sect

375
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,440
managed to be successful in his cultivation here

376
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,300
and ascended to the Nine Heavens.

377
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,270
This is the sacred object of our Yinlian Sect,

378
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,730
the Sky-Reaching Ladder.

379
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,400
No matter the aptitude of the cultivator,

380
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,360
climbing this Sky-Reaching Ladder

381
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,160
one is spared from the pain of
refining one's core during ascension to heaven.

382
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,890
They can rise straight above the clouds
and reach the Nine Heavens.

383
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,050
And the price to pay?

384
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,700
If something this good came without a price,

385
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,230
the Nine Heavens would be overcrowded by now.

386
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,160
Worthy of being an elite of Jingyun Sect.

387
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,420
You're indeed clever.

388
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,680
This Sky-Reaching Ladder is an object
that defies the natural order.

389
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,270
It harnesses the energy of heaven
and transforms the waters of earth.

390
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,600
It connects heaven and earth,
transcending all six realms.

391
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,830
However, you are a disciple of the immortal sect,

392
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,790
while this Sky-Reaching Ladder
is our clan's sacred object.

393
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,240
If you wish to achieve what others cannot,

394
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,750
you must endure suffering that others cannot bear.

395
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,350
Fierce winds will temper your body
while raging fires will burn your flesh.

396
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,120
The pain of having your tendons pulled
and bones shattered.

397
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,330
Can you withstand it?

398
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,830
Your spirit will be destroyed
while your heart is shattered.

399
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,270
This is the essence of a fate worse than death.

400
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,540
Are you scared now?

401
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,920
So you do have some guts.

402
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,170
However,

403
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,720
why should I let you pass so easily?

404
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,000
What do you want?

405
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,400
I want you to rescue Mr. Meng for me.

406
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
You should know him best.

407
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,020
If he wanted to leave,
he would have done so already.

408
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,950
You people from the Jingyun Sect

409
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,680
are all inflexible fools.

410
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,739
I'm helping you today,

411
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,219
so in the future, you must help me
deliver messages to Mr. Meng.

412
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:39,030
As long as it doesn't harm Jingyun Sect,

413
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,630
I'm fine.

414
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,510
Of course.

415
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,630
After all, it's Mr. Meng's sect too.

416
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,670
Alright, I promise you.

417
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,550
This is the Heart-Devouring Pill.

418
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,730
I'll only believe you if you take it.

419
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,030
From now on, every month,

420
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,030
you must come to me for the antidote.

421
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,739
Otherwise, the poison will consume
your internal organs.

422
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,370
Can you let me pass now?

423
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,800
Now I'm curious.

424
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,070
Who exactly is this person you'd sacrifice

425
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,610
everything for?

426
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,230
Heavenly Lord, did you bring any food?

427
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
What do you think?

428
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,510
Next time, I really need to
start practicing fasting.

429
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,110
If we keep waiting like this,

430
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,240
I'm afraid I'll starve to death first.

431
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,590
Heavenly Lord, chat with me for a while.

432
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
Let's divert our attention.

433
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,340
What do you want to talk about?

434
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,450
Between Immortal Lord Li Mo and Honglian...

435
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,710
what exactly happened

436
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,270
for her to be clinging on for centuries?

437
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,950
I don't know.

438
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,400
Aren't you the Master of Immortal Lord Li Mo?

439
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,660
How could you not know?

440
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,360
It was only after I sealed Honglian

441
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,020
that Li Mo became my disciple.

442
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,510
He didn't want to talk about it,

443
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,910
so I didn't probe either.

444
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,760
I thought I might find some clues
from their past

445
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,840
that could help us get out.

446
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
Look, Heavenly Lord.

447
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,590
Before you came,

448
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,510
Honglian showed me several scenes from her past

449
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,910
by simply crushing this.

450
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,350
Do you think all of these might be her memories?

451
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,190
Honglian's emotional baggage
is Immortal Lord Li Mo.

452
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,070
If we figure out what happened
between them in the past,

453
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,280
maybe we could find a way out of here?

454
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,420
We can give it a try.

455
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,600
Wait.

456
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,130
What's this?

457
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,740
The Twin Heart Seal.

458
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,100
From now on, wherever you are,

459
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,590
I'll be able to sense you.

460
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,130
Then I'll start.

461
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,710
Liar!

462
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,490
Every single one of them is a liar!

463
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,880
Stop!

464
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,480
Were the dozens of recent assault cases

465
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,690
all your doing?

466
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,610
So what if they were?

467
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,050
You are a demon that has
already assumed the human form.

468
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,780
You should focus on cultivation.

469
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,510
How can you practice these
evil and unorthodox techniques

470
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,240
and go as far as hurting people?

471
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,190
What has it got to do with you?

472
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm just trying to advise you.

473
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,370
Your actions violate the laws of heaven,

474
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,070
you'll surely face heavenly retribution.

475
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,580
Have you ever tasted
the evil energy of wronged souls

476
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
raging through your body?

477
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,590
Have you ever experienced

478
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,410
every inch of your meridians under your skin

479
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,630
being torn apart and then healed again?

480
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,690
What do you mean?

481
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,520
I was cursed when I was assuming the human form.

482
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,320
So tell me.

483
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,360
When has the laws of heaven
ever been fair to me?

484
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,030
Looking at it this way,
Honglian seems somewhat pitiful.

485
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,840
All I ever wanted was to find one true heart

486
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,110
to protect me.

487
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,150
But all of this...

488
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,320
turned out to be fake!

489
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,030
If that's the case, let me help you.

490
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,070
These are indeed all Honglian's memories.

491
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,160
Heavenly Lord, shall we continue?

492
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,400
Continue.

493
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,230
These are all traps set by mortals.

494
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,770
There are so many injured animals.

495
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,280
Can you save them all?

496
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,720
I'll save as many as I can.

497
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,710
I must admit, the cycle of day and night here

498
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,110
takes some getting used to.

499
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,360
Heavenly Lord, don't you feel dizzy?

500
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,340
You came at the right time.

501
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,510
This rabbit is just roasted.

502
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,400
It smells so good. Want to eat together?

503
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,760
Heavenly Lord, I think...

504
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,960
We're in an illusion.

505
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,320
It's all fake.

506
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,360
What's wrong?

507
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,510
Are you angry?

508
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,070
Spiritual energy is abundant here.

509
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,730
If you cultivate here, your evil energy
can be slightly weakened.

510
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,550
These can dispel some of the
evil energy in your body.

511
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,550
Take these first.

512
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,030
You've made me drink hundreds of bowls
of medicine these days,

513
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,030
but I haven't seen any improvement.

514
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,600
Can you really cure me or not?

515
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,550
The evil energy has been accumulating
in your body for too long.

516
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,760
We can't rush it. We have to take it slow.

517
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,670
Actually...

518
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,120
I know of a method that allows me
to heal even faster.

519
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,110
Why don't...

520
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,920
you love me?

521
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,670
I'll use the blood from your heart...

522
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,610
to break the curse.

523
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,510
I'm sorry,

524
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,690
I practice cultivation solely to
save and help others.

525
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,690
I have no interest in romantic love.

526
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,570
Heavenly Lord.

527
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,300
Do you really think Immortal Lord Li Mo
would remain unmoved?

528
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,070
Do you always talk this much?
