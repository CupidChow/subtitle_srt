[Xianyang Palace]

5
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
Since the spy is dead,

6
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,450
shall we close the case now?

7
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,840
I

8
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,700
urge Your Majesty to reconsider.

9
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,509
A dead man cannot speak.

10
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,590
Even if wrongly accused,
he cannot defend himself.

11
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,580
Besides,
these so-called treasonous letters

12
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,840
could have been fabricated
to frame someone.

13
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Huo Du

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,710
was appointed

15
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,950
Military Supervisor
of the Changfeng Army by the court.

16
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,350
And now, conveniently, he's labeled a spy.

17
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,030
It seems to me

18
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,150
that Li Shuang

19
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,470
is abusing her power

20
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,030
to persecute her opponents.

21
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,680
Deceiving the Emperor
is a crime punishable by death.

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
I suggest, Prince Li,

23
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,110
that you speak with caution
unless you have proof.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,630
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

25
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,570
The Li family
has been loyal for generations

26
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,480
and surely

27
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,710
would never commit such a despicable act.

28
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,680
It seems the Crown Prince

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,310
indeed has deep ties with the Li family.

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,960
No wonder Li Wei's son, Li Ting,

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,400
took your carriage

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
to leave the capital for the border.

33
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,520
Is that true?

34
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,160
I dare not lie.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
I wonder if Your Majesty

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,190
granted Li Ting special permission
to leave the capital.

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,079
Or perhaps

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,500
General Li

39
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,150
secretly sent his son to the border,

40
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,430
intending to take control of
the garrison troops

41
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,630
for his own purposes?

42
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,610
Our country

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,450
governs with
filial piety and righteousness.

44
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,800
Li Ting missed his elder sister
and went to visit her,

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
which is only natural.

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,770
If that's the case,

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,240
the spy case

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,530
remains inconclusive.

50
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,090
Hear my decree:

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,030
Li Wei is stripped of his rank
as General of Cavalry

52
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,470
and demoted to Military Protector.

53
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,560
The Li family in the capital

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,290
may not leave without summons.

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,950
Father, you are wise.

57
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,750
I'll put it here.

58
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,280
The shelf isn't sturdy enough.

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
It might collapse later.

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,000
He's carrying dead leaves
and fresh flowers upstairs.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,910
It must be

62
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,240
some kind of formation,

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,910
or perhaps he's trying to send a message.

64
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,640
How could a pile of random stuff

65
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,910
mean anything?

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
Spies are cunning.

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,450
We must remain on guard.

68
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,920
Understood.

69
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,520
Take it slow and be careful

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,430
while you work.

71
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,280
Alright.

72
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,430
Check the repaired roof

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,000
for leaks.

74
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,860
Will do.

75
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,120
Sister.

76
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,930
I've been looking for you.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,470
I've been looking for you.
Turns out you're here.

78
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,000
Come with me.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,380
I've got a surprise for you.

80
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:39,990
Let's go.

81
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,720
You spent the whole morning

82
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,880
working on this?

83
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,680
This is going to be your bed from now on.

84
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,750
I laid dried leaves at the bottom,

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,950
so it stays dry and warm.

86
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,190
And the flowers around it

87
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,250
will help you relax and sleep better.

88
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,640
What a waste of time.

89
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,310
How is this a waste of time?

90
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,480
You're a general—

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,140
busy and exhausted every day.

92
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,510
Even back in camp,
you've got a mountain of things to handle.

93
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,310
Eating well and getting good rest
really matters.

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
Who's this for?

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,750
Me.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,070
You?

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
After all that work,

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,430
I can't have you sleeping on a flower bed

99
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,030
while I take the common bunk.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,270
Besides,

101
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,920
that stone bed in the shed is so hard.

102
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,180
It's breaking my back.

103
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,230
Oh, right.

104
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,840
Where did you get these?

105
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,510
I got them in exchange
for plowing Auntie Huang's field.

106
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,170
You love drinking, don't you?

107
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,240

I've stayed with her every single day.

Why does it still hurt so much?

141

my body feels much more stable.

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040

blood?

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,240
Miss Li,

150
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,510
please don't be angry.

151
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,910
You told me before

152
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,110
that your brother was a bit simple-minded.

153
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,920
I thought you were deceiving me,

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
but seeing him today,

155
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,630
it's such a waste of his good looks.

156
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,780
I'm not simple-minded.

157
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,830
I'm sharp.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
Alright.

159
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,890
You're sharp.

160
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,120
Poor boy.

161
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,520
Auntie Huang,

162
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,690
I'm so sorry
to disturb you this late at night.

163
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,510
I apologize

164
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,630
on behalf of my brother.

165
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,550
Don't mention it.

166
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,670
This chicken was

167
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,210
quite difficult to catch anyway.

168
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,240
I wanted to give it to you

169
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,910
to help you regain your strength.

170
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,150
Why are you so greedy?

171
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,610
I was just about to stew it.

172
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,840
Go easy on him.

173
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,550
There's no point
in getting angry with a fool,

174
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,240
right?

175
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,440
I'm leaving.

176
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,390
Speak.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,120
Why are you sneaking around
in the middle of the night?

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,250
Are you that hungry?

179
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,480
I...

180
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,750
If I tell her

181
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,240
that I need to drink blood,

182
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,440
will she be scared,

183
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,150
or will she hit me badly?

184
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,510
Forget it.

185
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,200
Before I figure out the truth,

186
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,960
I'd better not

187
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,810
talk nonsense in front of her.

188
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm...

189
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,220
hungry.

190
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,480
Coming!

191
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,960
This...

192
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,420
This...

193
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,840
Have they arrived?

194
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,640
They're here!

195
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,180
The food supplies are here.

196
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,360
The food supplies are here!

197
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,240
Everyone,

198
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,790
go get your rations!

199
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,150
Hurry up, the food is being distributed!

200
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,440
Come on!

201
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,400
So much food!

202
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,590
Come quickly!

203
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,030
I guess

204
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,650
you don't know how to face them,

205
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,660
so you came up here to hide.

206
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,720
To them, meeting me

207
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,990
is the greatest fortune of their lives.

208
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,560
They see me as their savior.

209
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,030
But they don't know

210
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,920
that the one who destroyed their lives

211
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,790
is me.

212
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,520
This so-called kindness

213
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,180
is just a debt I owe.

214
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,480
It's been a lie

215
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,830
from start to finish.

216
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,400
But at least you wanted to make amends,

217
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,390
and you've done it.

218
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,910
You're a general,

219
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,770
guarding the border,

220
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,240
following the court's orders.

221
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
The killing, the war—

222
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,360
they're not your choice.

223
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,700
And look,

224
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,480
tonight they're drinking and dancing

225
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,600
so happily,

226
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,690
all because of you.

227
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,490
A shooting star!

228
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,550
Make a wish, quick!

229
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,780
What does it mean?

230
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,390
Shooting stars are fleeting but beautiful,

231
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,200
so

232
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,780
they're worth wishing on.

233
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,760
It's alright.

234
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,830
It's gone now.

235
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
There's another one!

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,960
Quick!

237
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,080
I wish

238
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,270
for a world without war,

239
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,250
where peace lasts forever.

240
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
I've already drunk blood.

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,670
Why do I still feel so unwell?

242
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,870
No way.

243
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
How could I take advantage of her
like this?

244
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Let it hurt then.

245
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,870
As long as I stay by her side,

246
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,170
I'll find a way eventually.

247
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,340
Welcome back to camp, General.

248
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Everyone has worked hard today.

249
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,150
Please rise.

250
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,680
Thank you, General.

251
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,480
Military Advisor Qin,

252
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,210
any unusual movements lately?

253
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,450
Early this morning,

254
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,650
a letter arrived from the capital.

255
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,550
[To Li Shuang]

256
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,880
[General's Residence]

257
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,500
Simply handing over the body

258
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,360
and the letter

259
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,430
won't settle this matter.

260
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,400
Jin'an killed Huo Du with his own hands.

261
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,640
We all witnessed it.

262
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,600
The only way to avert this crisis

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
is to escort him back to the capital.

264
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,270
Right now,

265
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,870
the Grand General is under house arrest
and has been stripped of his rank.

266
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,320
His Majesty
has always been deeply suspicious.

267
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,080
The Li family and the Changfeng Army

268
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,790
are already in grave danger.

269
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,180
No matter

270
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,210
what that man's intentions were,

271
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,360
killing without orders is a serious crime.

272
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,830
If you, General,

273
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,360
refuse to hand over the culprit,

274
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,850
the next step

275
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,980
will be the destruction
of your entire family.

276
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,030
You're back.

277
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,080
Why are you here?

278
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,050
Waiting for you.

279
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,070
Staying here is so boring.

280
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,750
I guess you've gotten used to

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,150
the freedom outside these past few days.

282
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,870
Back in the village,
I was the boss of the kids.

283
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,870
Everyone obeyed me.

284
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,670
But now that I'm back here,

285
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,200
they won't let me do a thing.

286
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,030
I try to cook,

287
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,300
and they're afraid I'll poison the food.

288
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,150
I try to clean,

289
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,450
and they're afraid
I'll plant hidden weapons.

290
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,550
Since I'm going to be staying here,

291
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,200
why don't you

292
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,910
give me some tasks to do?

293
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,840
So you want to work for me?

294
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,250
Then, would you be willing

295
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,670
to die for me?

296
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,670
I was just asking casually.

297
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,310
You don't have to answer.

298
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,460
Have a drink with me.

299
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,480
I've never asked you before.

300
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,410
What are your plans for the future?

301
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,480
Though you've lost all your memories,

302
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,340
you still have a long future ahead

303
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,780
to search for them

304
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,010
and live the life you want.

305
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,240
You've been with me for so long.

306
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,070
I won't treat you unfairly.

307
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,480
Here's some money.

308
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,510
Take it,

309
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,690
leave Lucheng,

310
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,200
and start a small business

311
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,400
to support yourself.

312
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,050
You're driving me away?

313
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,950
I'm not driving you away.

314
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,110
I'm sending you to where you belong.

315
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,270
If I've done something wrong,
just tell me.

316
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,110
I'll change.

317
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,310
My household is full of women.

318
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,550
If you stay,

319
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
it'll only spark gossip.

320
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,640
Besides,

321
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,340
with your current status,

322
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,880
you can't return
to the military camp either.

323
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,640
I have no memories.

324
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,290
I can't go anywhere.

325
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,960
And I can't leave you.

326
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,480
I can't live

327
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,550
without you.

328
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,680
You're a man.

329
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,790
You should have ambitions

330
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,030
and care for your family and your country.

331
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,630
Don't always think about
depending on others.

332
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,750
I've got enough weirdness
going on—

333
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
my body changing,

334
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,320
my extraordinary strength,

335
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,920
and a lack of control over it.

336
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,790
If I tell her now

337
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
that the only way
I can stabilize my condition

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,350
is by being near her,

339
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,750
would she believe me?

340
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,500
We haven't known each other for long,

341
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,090
but we've been through a lot together.

342
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,790
Don't you feel

343
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,880
even a little reluctant in your heart?

344
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,590
I've seen many soldiers

345
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,440
die in battle.

346
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,880
Life-and-death partings

347
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,480
are nothing new to me.

348
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,560
I've seen through it all.

349
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,960
Besides,

350
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,550
what we've been through

351
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,240
means nothing.

352
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,790
What if

353
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
I could die for you?

354
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
Life and death

355
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,720
happen in the blink of an eye.

356
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,240
Survival

357
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,060
is a human instinct.

358
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,480
Besides, you offer no proof.

359
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,720
Why should I believe you?

360
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
You're a general.

361
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,030
Your word is law.

362
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,260
If you tell me to leave,

363
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,310
then I'll go.

General,

387
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,690
are you really letting him go?

388
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,840
A major operation is underway tonight.

389
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,920
If he stays,

390
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,920
he'll only make things more dangerous.

391
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,310
I don't get it.

392
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,160
You've always been strict with the troops,

393
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,420
allowing no mistakes.

394
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,470
Why show mercy this time?

395
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,000
He risked his life

396
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,490
to save me and Li Ting multiple times.

397
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,730
With such a debt,

398
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,810
how could I,
out of my own selfish desires,

399
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,420
push him to his death?

400
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,030
But General,

401
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,030
at the heart of it,

402
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,560
it's because His Majesty

403
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,350
mistrusts

404
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,590
the Li family,

405
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,920
which is why he makes things difficult.

406
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,110
If His Majesty's suspicions
aren't cleared,

407
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,480
no matter who we send,

408
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,280
the court will never be satisfied.

409
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,790
From now on,

410
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,370
if His Majesty has any complaints,

411
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,680
all the blame

412
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,750
will fall on me alone.

413
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,960
Report!

414
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,680
General!

415
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,550
General!

416
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,070
I swear, I'm innocent!

417
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,680
Get out of the way!

418
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,350
Behave yourself!

419
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,400
Don't you know who I am?

420
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Behave yourself!

421
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,150
Move!

422
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,960
Let me go!

423
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,120
Hurry up!

424
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,300
Quick!

425
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,120
Go!

426
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,190
Chief,

427
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,020
we found it!

428
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,790
I didn't expect it to be so easy.

429
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,720
It seems
we shouldn't have been so hesitant before.

430
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
If we had acted sooner,

431
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,590
we wouldn't have been forced

432
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,070
into such a difficult position today.

433
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,720
Enough.

434
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,590
Wait!

435
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,500
Commandant Luo,

436
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
they've escaped.

437
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,860
Damn it!

438
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,800
They didn't fall for our trap.

439
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,770
The fake map is still here.

440
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,070
All of you,

441
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,790
go to the General's Residence immediately

442
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,350
and ensure the deployment map's safety.

443
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,200
Yes, sir!

444
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,470
Thanks to your vigilance, Brother.

445
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,510
That wretch

446
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,560
was actually putting on an act
with Luo Teng,

447
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,520
nearly trapping us in our own game.

448
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,510
Brother,

449
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,840
what should we do now?

450
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,350
Why are you sneaking around?

451
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,450
You're right. Why am I sneaking around?

452
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,450
What are you doing here?

453
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,590
[General's Residence]

454
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:50,890
Search!

455
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,550
Open up!

456
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,170
Anyone here?

457
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,590
Found it.

458
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,850
This must be the right one.

459
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,400
Alright,

460
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,430
let's go.

461
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,510
Wait.

462
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,730
A deployment map

463
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,150
is worth thousands of taels.

464
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,260
Tell me,

465
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,900
how much is her head worth?

466
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
With such pathetic skills,

467
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,650
you dare to plot against me?

468
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,470
Impossible.

469
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,640
Those who betray their country

470
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,200
have only one fate: death.

471
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,600
With skills that poor,

472
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,220
I have to find a chance to feign weakness.

473
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,880
Look out!

474
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,840
Do it now!

475
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,750
Are you alright?

476
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,790
Why did you come back?

477
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:07,920
I...

478
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,160
I wanted to protect you.

479
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,690
See?

480
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,240
I told you...

481
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,820
I could die for you.

482
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:20,920
Jin'an!

483
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,970
Stop!

484
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,680
Don't run!

485
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,530
Two are dead.

486
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Leaving him alive

487
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,840
is the true killing move.

488
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,130
General, you want to give
the deployment map to the Yao people?

489
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,890
Why?

490
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,950
General, are you suggesting

491
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,560
that we deliberately leave a flaw,

492
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,370
turn their own scheme against them,

493
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,930
and trap them?

494
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,550
Huo Du has been hiding
within our army for years.

495
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,550
His accomplices

496
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,230
won't be easy to identify.

497
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,200
The Yao Army is on the move now.

498
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
War is inevitable.

499
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,570
Using a fake deployment map as bait

500
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,560
will not only confuse the enemy,

501
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,590
but also help us identify
Huo Du's remaining allies,

502
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,310
so we can capture them all at once

503
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,040
and eliminate future threats.

504
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,450
But normally,

505
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,340
ordinary soldiers
can barely get their hands

506
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,810
on the deployment map.

507
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,310
If we make it too easy,

508
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,360
they'll see right through our plan.

509
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,350
That's why we need a trap within a trap.

510
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,280
The first map they steal too easily
won't be trusted,

511
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,250
but what about the second one
which they fight desperately to take?

512
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,160
General, you're truly the most devious.

513
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,620
I mean... the wisest.

514
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,590
By order of the Yao General,

515
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,270
we are requisitioning
the deployment map of the Changfeng Army.

516
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,550
Anyone who obtains and submits it,

517
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,670
regardless of background,

518
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,740
will be rewarded with 1,000 taels of gold.

519
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,070
With a reward in front
and severe punishment behind,

520
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,310
in the balance,

521
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,080
they have no choice

522
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,790
but to comply.

523
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,680
However,

524
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,150
Commandant Luo will have to suffer.

525
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
I will follow your orders, General.

526
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,010
I was wrong!

527
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Please stop hitting me! I was wrong!

528
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,310
When we go out later,

529
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,350
act a bit more furious—

530
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,210
like you're cutting ties with me.

531
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,110
[General's Residence]

532
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,180
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

533
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,070
Though the wound is deep,

534
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,790
it didn't hit any vital organs.

535
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,960
Logically,

536
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,930
his pulse shouldn't be this weak.

537
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,460
You seem really worried about him.

538
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,310
It's not that.

539
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,100
He blocked that knife

540
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
for my sake.

541
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,210
Get down.

542
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,000
Get down now.

543
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,240
I haven't even started on you yet.

544
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,200
You've been with me for so many years.

545
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,130
How can you have no sense of danger?

546
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,500
Trusting and taking him in so easily.

547
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,480
Who said I trust him?

548
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,110
I trust you.

549
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,950
Anyone who walks out of
the General's Residence alive

550
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,950
must be someone
you've tested and found trustworthy.

551
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,920
But his background is unknown.

552
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,550
Yet, despite his mysterious past,

553
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,480
he resolutely took a knife for you—

554
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,590
any doubts about him should be gone now.

555
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,480
If that knife had struck you instead,

556
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,440
it wouldn't be something

557
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,840
a few remedies could fix.

558
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,430
Come here.

559
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,310
Do you know

560
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,570
what he told me

561
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,000
when he was with me?

562
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,410
What did he say?

563
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,790
He said

564
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,730
he can't leave you.

565
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,900
He's handsome,

566
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,490
and he's devoted to you.

567
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,510
I'd say you two should...

568
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,160
What are you laughing at?

569
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,360
Don't make me hit you!

570
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,720
Always threatening people with violence—

571
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,240
do you forget you're still a young lady,

572
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,590
waiting to get married?

573
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,000
Blood...

574
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,110
Blood...

575
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:25,960
What?

576
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,070
He said...

577
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,140
What did he say?

578
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,720
Blood...

579
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,200
Blood.

580
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,680
Blood?

581
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,030
Blood...

582
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,929
I have read about this before.

583
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,280
Some martial artists

584
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,510
train with blood from a young age,

585
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,139
developing a thirst for it.

586
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,760
If they're severely wounded

587
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,840
and medicine doesn't help,

588
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,170
they'll need blood to sustain their life.

589
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,190
Could this be

590
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,630
why he hasn't woken up yet?

591
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,960
Let me go back
and check the medical texts.

592
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,670
Perhaps

593
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,530
I can find similar records there.

594
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,330
Here,

595
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,030
take it.

596
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,190
You should apply it

597
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,230
to the wound on your neck,

598
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,560
or it could leave a scar.

599
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Blood...

600
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,510
Blood...

601
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
Blood...

602
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
What did you say?

603
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,590
Blood...

604
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,770
What did you say?

605
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,530
You!

606
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,460
Could it be that

607
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,710
the methods in those ancient texts

608
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
actually work?

609
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,550
Look out!

610
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,360
Why did you come back?

611
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,670
I told you

612
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,680
I could die for you.

613
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,960
You really are foolish.

614
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,840
I went to great lengths to send you away

615
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,930
just to keep you away from trouble.

616
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,400
Why did you come back?

617
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,420
Though I can't transform at will
right now,

618
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,790
I was stabbed,

619
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,820
yet I'm recovering so quickly,

620
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,210
and even the discomfort in my chest

621
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,640
has eased considerably.

622
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,590
No,

623
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,460
there has to be more to it.

624
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,450
Could it be that

625
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,110
the one who can ease all my pain

626
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,240
is her?

627
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,000
You're awake.

628
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,590
I feel better now.

629
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,670
Glad to hear that.

630
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,500
Lu Xin told me

631
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,670
that your wound
needs to be dressed regularly

632
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,760
to heal quickly.

633
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,180
What are you doing?

634
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,510
Changing your bandage.

635
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,320
This self-healing ability is so strange.

636
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,090
If she finds out,

637
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,760
she'll definitely send me away again.

638
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,420
You took that stab to protect me,

639
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,630
so I should be the one taking care of you.

640
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,230
Your wound is worse than it was yesterday.
