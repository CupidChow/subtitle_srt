[Episode 11]

3
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,870
Are you alright?

4
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,940
I'm glad you're alive.

5
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,829
We lost?

6
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,400
We could've

7
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,360
annihilated the Changfeng Army

8
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,590
with your approach.

9
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,590
However,

10
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,079
a man in black just showed up

11
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,120
out of nowhere.

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,310
He has extraordinary martial skills.

13
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,079
He not only bailed Lucheng out,

14
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,870
but also killed General Shi Du

15
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,030
in collaboration with Li Shuang.

16
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,930
Who is this man?

17
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,010
He doesn't seem

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,630
to be from the Changfeng Army.

19
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,280
Besides,

20
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,960
the spies we planted in Lucheng

21
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,470
don't know anything about him,

22
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,280
as if he just

23
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,829
appeared out of thin air.

24
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,960
A man in black...

25
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,900
That was indeed beyond my expectations.

26
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,079
Counsellor,

27
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,490
General Shi Du already died.

28
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,190
What can we do now?

29
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,630
Shall we retreat?

30
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,080
This a must-win battle.

31
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,250
We can't go home without triumphs.

32
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,010
I will petition the court to appoint

33
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,470
a new military commander.

34
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,400
Hard though it is,

35
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,970
we must conquer Lucheng.

36
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,220
Stop!

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,630
My Lord.

38
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,030
I'm reduced

39
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,570
to this situation
because of that hateful Li Shuang.

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
When I'm back to the capital,

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll definitely lodge a serious complaint

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
against her to Prince Li!

43
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,420
My Lord,

44
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,840
we'd better hurry.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,180
I've had fast horses arranged ahead.

46
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,900
Let's go.

47
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,420
Go.

48
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,360
Lord Li!

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,160
It's quite late now.

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Where

51
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,800
are you two heading?

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,280
Lord Li would like a night stroll.

53
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
You're a mere military advisor.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,250
How dare you question
an imperial military supervisor?

55
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,360
I dare not.

56
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,960
However,

57
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,220
I'm afraid I might have to
ruin the night for you.

58
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,310
Lord Li,

59
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,070
the general requests your presence.

60
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,420
General.

61
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,210
You should be grateful
that you were captured by me

62
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,500
instead of Li Zhangyi.

63
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,310
Otherwise, you would've died by now.

64
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,210
Kill me if you want.

65
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,740
Why the gibberish?

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,100
As someone brave enough to sneak in
and burn our granaries alone,

67
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,670
you'd never fear death, would you?

68
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,790
Other than you, how many people

69
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,920
are on death missions in Lucheng?

70
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,060
Why did the Yao State send you here?

71
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
What exactly

72
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,080
is your relationship with Li Zhangyi?

73
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,670
Since you know I don't fear death,

74
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,240
I bet you're also aware

75
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,690
that you can't get

76
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,250
any information from me.

77
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,190
Resistance won't bring you any good.

78
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,100
I know people like you

79
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,500
aren't dreaded by death,

80
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,500
but survival.

81
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,090
I just came back
from the Fragrance Garden.

82
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,500
In order to catch you,

83
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,940
Li Zhangyi ordered
all the people there to be killed.

84
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,280
Twenty-odd living souls just perished,

85
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,130
including Yanzhi.

86
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,940
There's a sachet.

87
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,370
You recognize it, don't you?

88
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,070
All of you are evil.

89
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,210
Take my life now, I dare you!

90
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,690
Don't move!

91
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,370
Kill me!

92
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,660
The herbs in this sachet have

93
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,860
nerve-soothing and sleep-inducing effects.

94
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,790
I guess you have trouble sleeping.

95
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,330
So, Yanzhi put such herbs in this sachet

96
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,450
for you to carry it around.

97
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,990
That shows she truly cared for you.

98
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,620
But it didn't occur to her

99
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,570
that this very gesture of kindness

100
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,720
would cost her life in the end.

101
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,770
I was trained to sacrifice myself
for missions in childhood.

102
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,430
Crawling out from piles of corpses,

103
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,310
I've long forgotten
what it feels like to be a human.

104
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,300
Why on earth
would there be such a silly girl?

105
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,500
She sympathized with me,

106
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,890
trusted me and cared for me.

107
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,860
She gave me the only bit

108
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,690
of genuine love
I've ever got in these 20 years.

109
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,330
Now that you know
Yanzhi's affection for you,

110
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,330
you should avenge her unjust death!

111
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,810
Unjust deaths happen every now and then,
don't they?

112
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,260
How foolish of Yanzhi,

113
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,330
for choosing me
to be her inseparable confidant.

114
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,059
She always looked forward

115
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,650
to us leaving the brothel

116
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,330
and leading a carefree life.

117
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,850
To this day, I still don't understand

118
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,730
how much courage it'd take

119
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,200
for someone
to completely trust another person

120
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,970
in such chaotic times.

121
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,490
But it's fine.

122
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,260
I'll ask Yanzhi myself.

123
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,130
Before Miss Yanzhi died,

124
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,330
she still believed you were innocent.

125
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,860
You've already failed her.

126
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,180
Committing suicide

127
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,980
will only let her down even more!

128
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,240
Spill out Li Zhangyi's evildoing

129
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,910
to avenge your dead bosom friend now.

130
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,930
You've already completed the mission

131
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,720
assigned by the Yao State.

132
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,330
Li Zhangyi

133
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,760
refused to open the city gate
just to cover up

134
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,210
his mistakes,

135
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,580
resulting in the numerous deaths
of Lucheng soldiers!

136
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,340
I swear to drag him...

137
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,610
down to hell.

138
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,450
Li Zhangyi confessed
that he lost his token

139
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,380
as a result of staying overnight

140
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,570
in the Fragrance Garden.

141
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,210
Plus Yunge's testimony,

142
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,570
this time,

143
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,300
he won't get away.

144
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,720
For such a despicable man,

145
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,710
even death can't redeem his sins.

146
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,210
Have Li Zhangyi escorted

147
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,810
to the capital by a troop.

148
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,540
I've written

149
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,690
a memorial detailing this incident.

150
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,690
Deliver it to the capital, together with

151
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,810
these two testimonies,

152
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,020
for His Majesty to make a ruling.

153
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,490
Yes.

154
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,290
By the way,

155
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,740
has Yunge's funeral been taken care of?

156
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,390
Miss Yanzhi's and her bodies
have been buried together.

157
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,850
But, General,

158
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,180
she was a spy
from the Yao State after all.

159
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
Is what we've done

160
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,940
somewhat inappropriate?

161
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,340
In such turbulent times,

162
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,740
does anyone truly
have control of their lives?

163
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,840
All are unfortunate beings.

164
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,660
Mr. Ji,

165
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,550
there's a visitor for you.

166
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
You shouldn't have come here, Miss.

167
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,180
Please leave.

168
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,700
Don't take it wrong.

169
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,190
I'm not here to pester you.

170
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,950
Hearing you got wounded
on the battlefield,

171
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,230
I just wanted to bring you some medicine.

172
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,730
How has

173
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,330
the general been?

174
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,240
She's doing great.

175
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,970
But now,

176
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,280
she's busy sending people

177
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,940
to look for Jin'an in the city.

178
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,570
I don't think she'd have time

179
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,950
to worry about you now.

180
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,660
A loyal aide though you are,

181
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,300
you end up in prison.

182
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Is it worthwhile?

183
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,490
I've followed the general for years.

184
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,350
Whether this is worthwhile or not

185
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,670
can't be explained in just a few words.

186
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,260
Indeed.

187
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,420
Over these years,

188
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,900
you've never

189
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,540
disobeyed Shuang.

190
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,060
Knowing clearly

191
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,570
that Jin'an has her complete trust,

192
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
you still made that hasty decision.

193
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,330
Is Jin'an really

194
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,080
an unbearable eyesore to you?

195
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,180
As head of the Guardians' Unit,

196
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,810
I'm obligated to protect the general.

197
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,940
I can't help but suspect

198
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,670
that man's peculiar identity.

199
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,180
Is it suspicion or jealousy?

200
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,020
Maybe

201
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,820
you envy him for sharing Shuang's worries

202
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
and solving problems

203
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,060
for her.

204
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,140
Do you remember

205
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,060
how we first met three years ago?

206
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,900
That day,

207
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,420
I was collecting herbs alone
on a mountain.

208
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,940
I made a blunder

209
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,970
and early fell off a cliff.

210
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,690
Grab tight!

211
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,550
Careful.

212
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,950
I always remember

213
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,500
how gallant you looked
when you saved my life.

214
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,420
General,

215
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,490
this lady says she has medical skills

216
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,150
and the herbs
that can purge your body of toxins.

217
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,600
Of course, I also remember

218
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,610
the panic and worry in your eyes,

219
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,270
when Shuang was poisoned.

220
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
At that moment,

221
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,810
I should've realized

222
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,020
that was the way you look

223
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
when you truly love someone.

224
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,180
She's the general I work for.

225
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,900
I have nothing for her

226
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,580
but lifelong loyalty

227
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,560
and sworn allegiance.

228
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,490
No other feelings are involved.

229
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,490
Miss, I must ask you to refrain

230
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,350
from saying those remarks again,

231
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
in case those with ill intentions
hear them

232
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,000
and tarnish the General's reputation.

233
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,180
You know what?

234
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,330
One's fondness for another person

235
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,590
is like running waters

236
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,090
that can't be stopped,

237
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,370
even if it's left unsaid.

238
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,140
I'd better get back to my patients

239
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
at the clinic now.

240
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,290
Don't forget to
regularly apply the ointment.

241
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,560
I'll get you out of the prison.

242
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,810
I must repay you

243
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,400
for saving my life.

244
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,180
[General's Residence]

245
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,460
Miss Lu.

246
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,170
Where have you been?

247
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,310
Shuang had her people
look for you everywhere.

248
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,130
She was worried sick.

249
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,260
Did you get injured?

250
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,490
No, I'm fine.

251
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,260
The Changfeng Army entered the city.

252
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,970
People swarmed the streets
to welcome them.

253
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,690
I was separated

254
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,730
by the hustling crowds,

255
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,810
but I managed to find my way back.

256
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,670
That was a serious matter,

257
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,090
yet you're still smiling.

258
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,780
I thought

259
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,440
you were harmed by Li Zhangyi.

260
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,740
I'm perfectly fine.

261
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,180
Are you okay?

262
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,340
Of course I am.

263
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,050
I'm glad you're fine.

264
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,040
It's good news.

265
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,730
I heard on my way back

266
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,410
that Ji Ran had been thrown into prison.

267
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,780
Were you loitering

268
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
for that matter?

269
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,670
I did come here to plead with Shuang.

270
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,869
I pondered it over and over,

271
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,609
but just couldn't bring myself
to utter a word.

272
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,869
Now that you're safe and sound,

273
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,760
would you please do me a favor?

274
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,180
Can you ask Shuang

275
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,180
to release Ji Ran?

276
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,770
If you're mad,

277
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,630
then beat me up.

278
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,860
Vent your anger

279
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
right at me, okay?

280
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,860
Miss Lu,

281
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,420
I doubt

282
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
if Ji Ran will appreciate your help.

283
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,580
Is it worthwhile

284
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,340
to go to so much trouble
for a man who always gives you

285
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,400
the cold shoulder?

286
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,150
Whether it's worthwhile or not
doesn't matter.

287
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,820
When you love someone,

288
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,250
you're ready to do anything
for him or her.

289
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,730
You'd put yourself in their shoes.

290
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,420
Their concerns are your concerns.

291
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,970
A simple smile of Ji Ran's is enough

292
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,940
to make my day.

293
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,620
What's more,

294
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,180
he once saved my life.

295
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,330
If I can do something for him,

296
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,660
I'll be content.

297
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,290
Ji Ran did make a mistake.

298
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,310
But he behaved that way

299
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,180
only out of concern
for the general's safety.

300
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,900
As you said,

301
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,900
pursuing this matter further

302
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,180
when I'm safe and sound

303
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,280
would only make me seem petty.

304
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,380
Does it mean you've agreed to help?

305
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,260
Actually, I owe him a thank you.

306
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,870
I gained something important
thanks to his acts.

307
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,660
Come in.

308
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,970
Waiting for someone?

309
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,180
Yes, I am.

310
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,910
You're smirking. Seriously?

311
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,230
You broke into the city tower

312
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,890
and held an official hostage.

313
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,780
You wanted to die or what?

314
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,230
I offered unsolicited advice
at the military camp that day.

315
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,060
Then

316
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,140
an accident kept me

317
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,690
from returning to the General's Residence.

318
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,620
I thought you'd find me suspicious.

319
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,750
But now it seems like

320
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,550
you're worried about my safety instead.

321
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,800
I'm just happy.

322
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,340
Happy?

323
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,530
Only living people get to feel that.

324
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,260
You fell off the cliff
when fighting Ji Ran.

325
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,520
Yet you didn't get hurt at all?

326
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,720
I was lucky enough

327
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,740
to have landed on a tree under the cliff.

328
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,490
Do you not believe me?

329
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,620
I'll undress for you to see my body.

330
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,900
You've seen it already.

331
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,560
Never mind!

332
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,660
You've come back safely anyway.

333
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,950
Now that I'm safe and sound,

334
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,010
will you

335
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,990
just drop the matter

336
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,960
and release Ji Ran?

337
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,530
There is strict discipline
in the Changfeng Army.

338
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,290
For taking action without permission,

339
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,690
he deserves punishment.

340
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
But my identity does seem peculiar.

341
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,010
It raises suspicion,
especially from his perspective.

342
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,690
It'll be a huge loss

343
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,100
to fail a devoted warrior

344
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,970
for this matter.

345
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,510
Every time I was in danger,

346
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,210
you always showed up.

347
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,640
and rescued me from peril.

348
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,940
Why can't I choose you over him?

349
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,580
General.

350
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,590
With the enemy confronting us,

351
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,570
I shouldn't have put you in detention.

352
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,410
After working with me for years,

353
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,550
you still went for that reckless action.

354
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,100
Do you admit you did wrong?

355
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,860
Yes, I do.

356
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,050
My fault

357
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,880
was acting against Jin'an

358
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,290
without orders

359
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,480
and nearly causing his death.

360
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,340
That said,

361
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,050
General,

362
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,840
camouflage often looks real.

363
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,000
Jin'an can't be cleared of suspicion

364
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,810
until his identity is verified.

365
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,270
I admit I did wrong,

366
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,760
but I don't regret taking action.

367
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,670
See you later, General.

368
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,530
To this day, I still don't understand

369
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,460
how much courage it'd take

370
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,810
for someone
to completely trust another person

371
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,970
in such chaotic times.

372
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,590
He's honest about everything,

373
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,210
except for his real identity.

374
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,320
Perhaps he has his own reason.

375
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,190
Even if I keep probing,

376
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
I might not get the truth.

377
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,580
Maybe sometimes,

378
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,850
trust

379
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,250
is the greatest truth of all.

380
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,250
General!

381
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,290
Word from our scouts

382
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,580
says the Yao Army hasn't withdrawn.

383
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,290
Instead,

384
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,420
they've set up camp 20 li from Lucheng.

385
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,930
Reportedly,

386
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,590
they have a new commander now,

387
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,860
named Zhao Jingyuan.

388
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,620
These vile creatures

389
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,210
won't stop haunting us.

390
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,210
We'll run out of

391
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,170
supplies in four days.

392
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,930
They can starve us out

393
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,870
simply by putting us under siege.

394
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,580
Qin Lan,

395
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,100
take three soldiers with you and set out

396
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,900
for Yongcheng

397
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,500
right now to ask for help.

398
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,490
Yongcheng is nearest to Lucheng.

399
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,770
Reinforcements and supplies

400
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,100
can reach us in two days.

401
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,100
All we need to do
is hold out for two days.

402
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,530
Then there will be a turning point.

403
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,460
Got it, General.

404
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,730
To General Zhao!

405
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,580
To General Zhao!

406
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,940
Everybody,

407
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,380
drink up!

408
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,820
General Zhao is the best
military commander of the Yao State.

409
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,940
Under your leadership, General Zhao,

410
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,490
I believe

411
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,700
our army will be an unstoppable force.

412
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,050
You're just being modest, Counsellor.

413
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,650
It is known to all that you are

414
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,420
a brilliant military strategist

415
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,830
with unmatched intelligence.

416
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,550
This time,

417
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,900
with our joint efforts,

418
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,360
we'll definitely conquer

419
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,210
Lucheng

420
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,900
with ease.

421
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,530
General,

422
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,220
I wish you every success.

423
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,210
We wish you every success!

424
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,480
The general is dead!

425
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,250
Counsellor...

426
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,100
Scram!

427
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,950
Greetings, My Lord.

428
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,100
The battle in the south
was proven a failure.

429
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,730
You lost the Battle of Lucheng as well.

430
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,200
I'll make up for it with hard work.

431
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,290
Make up for it?

432
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,930
Your life is worth nothing.

433
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,730
Forgive my ignorance.

434
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,730
Considering my loyal service
to the Empress Dowager,

435
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,530
would you enlighten me, My Lord?

436
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,450
Rise.

437
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,750
Thanks, My Lord.

438
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,370
I came here

439
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,460
to give you an opportunity
to redeem yourself.

440
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,530
You've seen that man in black.

441
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,490
Do you find him

442
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,070
familiar?

443
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,940
He...

444
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,120
He does resemble someone I know of.

445
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,000
But Prince Annan already died, didn't he?

446
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,340
How is it possible...

447
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,580
Good news, General.

448
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,050
At dawn today,

449
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,510
the Yao Army's general

450
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,290
was killed.

451
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,340
The killer has even placed a flag

452
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,770
in the center of the battlefield.

453
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,490
Now,

454
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,340
the Yao Army

455
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
is fluttered.

456
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,450
Who's the killer?

457
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,940
It's not clear yet.

458
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,140
Report!

459
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:18,950
General,

460
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,970
someone dropped this box

461
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,140
at the entrance to the office,

462
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,270
along with a letter.

463
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,130
Open it up.

464
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,400
[This head is a gift for you]

465
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,450
Could this

466
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,540
have been done by the man in black?

467
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,730
Report!

468
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,770
Military Advisor Qin,

469
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,030
a carrier pigeon brought back a message.

470
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,950
The Yao Army stormed Ninglan.

471
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,180
Ninglan has fallen.

472
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,140
How can we not fight them?

473
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,970
We have to wait.

474
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,800
Do you have a better plan?

475
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,770
-Are you getting cold feet?
-We have to preserve our strength!

476
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,580
Zhao Jingyuan's head

477
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,140
is still hanging outside,

478
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,180
dripping blood!

479
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,620
Who led the Yao Army to attack Ninglan?

480
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,400
Enough.

481
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,460
What's the use of bickering?

482
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,860
Ninglan
is the most important transportation hub

483
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,490
connecting Yongcheng and Lucheng.

484
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,580
Military Advisor Qin has to pass through

485
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,970
that city when he brings back

486
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,900
weapons, horses,

487
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,530
reinforcements,

488
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,290
and supplies.

489
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,580
Now, we've lost Ninglan.

490
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,530
Military Advisor Qin
must be in a tough spot.

491
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,060
Besides,

492
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,820
I'm afraid all our deployments

493
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,620
are within the enemy's expectations.

494
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,860
Now, our provisions can only

495
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,660
sustain the army for three days.

496
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,170
We must recapture Ninglan,

497
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,300
or we will be doomed.

498
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,250
I'm worried

499
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,110
we might lose Lucheng too.

500
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,140
Easy for you to say.

501
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,050
The Yao Army stormed Ninglan
with 20,000 soldiers.

502
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,660
We can merely match that number

503
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,900
only if we commit all our forces.

504
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,940
How do we fight them?

505
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,770
What's more,

506
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,770
it's already hard for us
to keep Lucheng intact.

507
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,860
If we divide up our forces now,

508
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,210
by the time the reinforcements arrive,

509
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,620
Lucheng will have been lost!

510
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,020
Then what do you suggest?

511
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,250
Sitting back and waiting for doom?

512
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,200
At least we get to live longer that way!

513
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,330
Listen up,

514
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,820
Changfeng warriors
would rather die fighting

515
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,970
than die waiting!

516
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,730
That's right!

517
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,420
Enough!

518
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,210
Liu Yun coped brilliantly

519
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,340
when the military commander

520
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,010
was replaced at a critical time.

521
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,130
He's no ordinary man.

522
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,890
This is

523
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,880
the map of Ninglan?

524
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,310
How did you get hold of this treasure?

525
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,010
This will

526
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,860
largely increase our chances

527
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,140
of recapturing Ninglan!

528
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,420
Right.

529
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,450
Yes. Things are looking up now.

530
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,100
Indeed.

531
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,980
We have to take Ninglan back.

532
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,860
Lucheng

533
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,580
must remain ours too.

534
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,620
How visionary of you, General.

535
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,970
We all admire you!

536
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,970
Cheers!

537
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,900
Drink up, guys!

538
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,660
Absolutely!

539
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,440
What a delight!

540
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,490
Drink up!

541
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,380
Let's drink!

542
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,330
Sure!

543
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,730
Stop eating!

544
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,370
Have a drink!

545
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:47,890
Come on.

546
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,350
Here it goes.

547
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,130
Fill it up.

548
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,140
Guys,

549
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,620
conquering Ninglan

550
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,290
is equal to sounding the death knell
for the Taijin Army.

551
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,090
Next,

552
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
all we have to do is wait and observe.

553
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,770
By simply besieging them and waiting

554
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,770
till they run out of supplies,

555
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,940
we can easily

556
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,720
conquer Lucheng,

557
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,940
even if we don't launch attacks.

558
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,940
Victory is within reach!

559
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,490
Come on.

560
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,490
Drink up!

561
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,100
Guys,

562
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,340
the credit goes to our counsellor,

563
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,620
this wise strategist

564
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,010
who turned the tables!

565
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,970
We swear to

566
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:19,860
faithfully

567
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,940
follow

568
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,770
the counsellor's lead!

569
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,140
We swear to
faithfully follow the counsellor's lead!

570
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,420
Hubris

571
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,100
leads to downfall.

572
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,670
I dare not be your sole leader.

573
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,110
Captain Jiang,

574
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,570
why not share this responsibility with me?

575
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,860
Under the influence of liquor,

576
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,920
I got carried away.

577
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,250
Please forgive me, My Lord.

578
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,660
Why the panic, Captain?

579
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,890
It's an honor to be a general.

580
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,100
I dare not.

581
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,500
I dare not play this role.

582
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,460
But the army
desperately needs a new general.

583
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,900
Well then...

584
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,670
What about the rest of you?

585
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,530
Greetings, General.

586
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,450
Greetings, General.

587
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,970
General Shi Du and General Zhao Jingyuan

588
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,830
died heroically for our country.

589
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,180
His Highness has decreed

590
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,340
enormous support for the bereaved

591
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,590
in honor of the departed.

592
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,920
Our army lost two generals consecutively

593
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,980
all because of the man in black.

594
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,330
But we're not daunted

595
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,530
by his trivial stunts.

596
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,260
Look at our formidable forces.

597
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,860
How is that man alone able to

598
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,580
shake our 50,000 valiant Yao soldiers?

599
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,900
To boost the morale,

600
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,100
His Majesty decided to

601
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,030
promote Tian Daweng

602
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,390
to Guardian General,

603
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,690
who shall command all the troops.

604
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,820
Hopefully,

605
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,970
under the new general's guidance,

606
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,860
our army will capture Lucheng

607
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,900
and bring triumphs to the Yao State!

608
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:52,380
Capture Lucheng
and bring triumphs to the Yao State!

609
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,470
Capture Lucheng!

610
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,860
General.

611
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,760
The Yao Army

612
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,500
has selected a new general?

613
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,860
Strong though their momentum is,

614
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,440
after losing two generals,

615
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,770
they've been frustrated.

616
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,970
Boosting morale is their priority.

617
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,250
They must've picked this new general

618
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,580
with extreme prudence.

619
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,860
But given that they're making

620
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,920
quite a splash now,

621
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,100
I think they're up to something.

622
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,920
At this moment,

623
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,050
it's the best for the Yao Army

624
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,100
to take no action.

625
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,110
They're only making these noises

626
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,530
to attract the man in black.

627
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,590
General, you think

628
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,190
this is a trap for that man?

629
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,820
Liu Yun is indeed a marvelous strategist.

630
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,280
He calculates every step.

631
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,900
He has anticipated each of

632
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
our moves.

633
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,730
The only thing he couldn't expect

634
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,050
was the appearance of the man in black.

635
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,100
If I were him,

636
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,050
I'd also like to eliminate that guy soon

637
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,250
to clear all menaces.

638
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,100
Ji Ran!

639
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,860
Yes.

640
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,250
Have 2,000 elite soldiers

641
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,860
follow me to Ninglan with light gear.

642
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,720
You and Luo Teng

643
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,530
will stay put.

644
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,340
General,

645
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,290
this is not a good idea.

646
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,100
The Yao Army has

647
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,660
laid siege to the entire Ninglan.

648
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,380
Though we have the map of Ninglan,

649
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,040
we're still no match for them.

650
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,990
Please think twice about it, General.

651
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,820
The Yao Army

652
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,719
is determined to win this battle.

653
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,900
We have to fight them
till our last breath.

654
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,050
Select 2,000 soldiers.

655
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,570
Record

656
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,570
their names

657
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,340
and family backgrounds.

658
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,900
Send the registry
to the General's Residence.

659
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,300
They'll all be rewarded.

660
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,010
General...

661
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,940
No more talking.

662
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,960
Do as I said.

663
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,219
Even sky-reaching wings

664
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,420
won't save me from impending danger.

665
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,260
At this point,

666
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,909
I only wish to devote my life

667
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:58,650
to Taijin

668
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,510
and to the Changfeng Army.

669
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,090
Please

670
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,910
send my corpse to my father.

671
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
This undutiful daughter

672
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,450
wishes her father and her brother Ting

673
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,380
lifelong safety and tranquility.

674
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm not even

675
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,860
mentioned in your last words.

676
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,700
You're taking

677
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,780
only 2,000 soldiers
to the besieged Ninglan.

678
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,450
If the Yao Army learns of it,

679
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,170
they'll strike at you

680
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,970
and hunt you down.

681
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,510
General, are you planning

682
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,100
to use yourself as bait?

683
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,650
I am a general.

684
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,220
There are

685
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,670
certain duties I have to fulfill.

686
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,990
Moreover, I promised Zang Budu

687
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,470
to protect Ninglan,

688
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,420
once the war broke out.

689
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,900
I'm a woman of my word.

690
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,090
However slim the chances are,

691
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,950
I have to take this gamble.

692
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,170
What if you lose?

693
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,290
If I lose,

694
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,210
the blood pact between us will break.

695
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,550
Then you'll be free.

696
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,050
At this point,

697
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,370
you still think that so-called freedom

698
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,380
is what I value most?

699
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,790
My life is bound with yours.

700
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,190
If you are to gamble your life,

701
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,110
I'll make sure you don't lose.

702
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,300
Take 10,000 soldiers with you
to recapture Ninglan.

703
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,430
I'll stall the main Yao forces for you.

704
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,700
You figured it out long ago, didn't you?

705
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,900
Are you waiting for me to tell the truth?

706
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,130
I'm sorry...

707
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,010
I kept it secret from you for so long.

708
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,660
The Yao Army has taken action.

709
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,800
They remain resolute

710
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,100
in capturing Lucheng and Ninglan.

711
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,160
Whether you show up or not,

712
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,450
they won't easily back off.

713
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,370
I'd hate to see anyone die in vain again.

714
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,390
I also resent the idea

715
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,490
of you risking your life.

716
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,530
The moment I went on the battlefield

717
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,780
and barged into the enemy's camp

718
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,420
to slay their general,

719
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,600
I already left myself no way out.

720
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,030
You hate for me to risk my life.

721
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,350
I bet you surely understand

722
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,160
I care about you...

723
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,850

Yes.

763
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,290
Ninglan is easy to defend,
but hard to attack.

764
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,940
There are 20,000 Yao soldiers there.
