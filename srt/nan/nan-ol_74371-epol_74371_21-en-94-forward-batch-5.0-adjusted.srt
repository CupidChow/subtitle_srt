00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,910
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,870
Master,

4
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,550
Prince Cheng's men are
still outside.

5
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,229
Prince Cheng

6
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,950
apparently came here for Mr. Qin.

7
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,509
Now, the victims' clothes are
mysteriously missing.

8
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,229
I'm worried that...

9
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,200
Capital Prefect,

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,759
Young Master Qin is an strategist of mine.

11
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,560
Please address her
as Master Wan from now on.

12
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,320
Yes, I got it.

13
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,670
-But now…
-Don’t worry.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,009
I only need four hours as I said.

15
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,289
To proceed,

16
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,100
I'll have to trouble Constable Zhan
for one thing.

17
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,900
I'm at Your Highness's service.

18
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,710
Please go to the East Water Gate

19
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,630
and identify the fish vendors
who deliver fish to the restaurants

20
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,590
in the West Market.

21
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,060
Got it.

22
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,740
Didn't Master Wan say

23
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,710
the victim must've eaten in a small diner?

24
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,889
Why would fish vendors
bother to make deliveries to small diners?

25
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,110
Fish are fragile goods.

26
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,470
Some are inevitably damaged
during transport.

27
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,380
Fish vendors

28
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,579
usually keep the dead and injured fish
for themselves,

29
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,240
or sell them cheaply to small diners.

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,300
Finding the right fish vendor

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,350
will lead us to the diner
that purchased the fish.

32
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,350
I understand now.

33
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,640
But Prince Cheng...

34
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,340
Master Wan is new to the city.

35
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,700
I'll show her around first.

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,160
It'll only take two hours.

37
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,770
Bai Feng,

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,700
be our coachman.

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,190
Yes.

40
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,640
Two hours...

41
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,310
The Marquis of Zhongyong is
sparing no effort

42
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,840
to assist the Crown Prince.

43
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,260
I can't believe he'd drag you into this.

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,860
I was looking for a chance
to enter the criminal justice system.

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,579
What they've done suits me perfectly,

46
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,130
and has saved you much trouble.

47
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,329
I don't mind trouble.

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,510
It's just that there's a tangled net of
power players behind this matter.

49
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,790
I'm afraid the attention you get
will endanger you.

50
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,880
Today, you've seen
the way Prince Cheng acts.

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,710
You should be aware of

52
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,860
the uncontainable hostility
between him and the Crown Prince

53
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,660
You might be

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,630
caught in their political struggles

55
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,030
and reduced to a pawn of others'.

56
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,890
I'm not afraid.

57
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,140
Don't worry.

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,310
I'll be cautious.

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,190
To seek justice for the murdered women

60
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,850
and to clear
Prince Jin's and my father's names,

61
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,910
I must pursue

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,100
this case to the end.

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,420
Okay.

64
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,960
Go ahead and act as you see fit.

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,990
Just don't forget to keep your guard up.

66
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,390
The Emperor has granted me
approval today.

67
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,510
From now on, you can work on any cases

68
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,710
undertaken by the Ministry of Justice.

69
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,329
Thank you.

70
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,370
[Prince Yi’s Mansion]

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,230
Why did you bring me
to Prince Yi's residence?

72
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,910
I want you to meet someone.

73
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,840
It's also a way to lose those tails.

74
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,860
It seems desolate. How come?

75
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,850
It's a prince's mansion without a prince.

76
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,580
How can it not appear desolate?

77
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,750
Chi.

78
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,290
Why are you here so early?

79
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,620
Fix your clothes.

80
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,660
Where did you hang out last night?

81
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,970
Little Wan'er?

82
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,310
Chi, why didn't you tell me
she was coming too?

83
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,630
She might be charmed by my pretty looks.

84
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,260
You can't blame me if that happens.

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,580
Your Highness is worrying about nothing.

86
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,930
You're dressed like a man
shortly after your return to the capital.

87
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,400
Is it because you find
men's apparel classy,

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,000
or because you're
investigating a case again?

89
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,220
There's a spy for Yan Qi at the gate.

90
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,380
Go chase him away.

91
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,190
Why are Prince Cheng's people after you?

92
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,330
You're not working on that tricky case
for the Crown Prince, are you?

93
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,380
Cut the crap. Go get rid of that spy now.

94
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,580
I'll wait till you come back
to visit Madam.

95
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,840
You go visit her alone.

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,020
She'd rather read scriptures than see me.

97
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,080
She'd only make an exception for you.

98
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,140
I'll go deal with

99
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,170
that hateful spy.

100
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,580
Your clothes!

101
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,750
I've brought a friend to meet Madam.

102
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,950
Is she available now?

103
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,980
Madam is copying scriptures.

104
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,180
Please wait a moment.

105
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,750
Why do you all refer to
Yan Li's mother as "Madam"

106
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,080
instead of "Princess"?

107
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,690
I'll tell you later.

108
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,320
Just call her "Madam."

109
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,450
[Princess Yi]

110
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,340
Greetings, Madam.

111
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,240
I haven't seen you for over a year.

112
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,100
Now, you're looking
more and more like your father.

113
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,670
Who is this?

114
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,190
She's Qin Wan,
the ninth child of the Qin family.

115
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,520
Her father is Qin Liang.

116
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,320
Nice to meet you, Madam.

117
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,350
I didn't know about your visit,

118
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,010
so I didn't prepare any gifts.

119
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,460
I came here without notice.

120
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,990
Apologies for my rudeness.

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
This is not much of a gift,

122
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,010
but I'd like you to have it.

123
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,630
I can't accept it.

124
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,870
Chi

125
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,550
has finally brought a lady to meet me.

126
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm very delighted.

127
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,409
Please take it.

128
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,400
Maybe it'll remind you of me
in the future.

129
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
Thank you, Madam.

130
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,900
During our stay in the capital,

131
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,380
we'll pay regular visits to you.

132
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,140
No need.

133
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,310
Just look after Li for me.

134
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,310
Chi,

135
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,070
if possible,

136
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,550
leave the capital soon.

137
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,400
I guess this hairpin

138
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,160
symbolizes the love
between Madam and Prince Yi.

139
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,700
Why did she give it to me,

140
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,350
instead of saving it for Yan Li?

141
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,280
Do you know about

142
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,190
the rebellion staged by Fu Chengye
20 years ago,

143
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,100
the then
Sichuan pacification commissioner?

144
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,270
The Fu family were all executed
for that reason.

145
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,400
Madam is Fu Chengye's younger sister.

146
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,260
Then Prince Yi...

147
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,140
Prince Yi

148
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,080
reported to Fu Chengye.

149
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,950
He was the inspector-general of Gongzhou,

150
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,750
named Yan Han.

151
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,220
Prince Yi was a farmer's son
who later enlisted with military forces.

152
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,480
Given his brilliant track records,

153
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,680
Fu Chengye valued him

154
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,650
and married his own daughter to him.

155
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,620
[Tier-one loyal warrior]

156
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,270
[Fu Residence]

157
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,390
When Prince Yi discovered
Fu Chengye's intent to start a coup,

158
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,580
Madam was already pregnant with Yan Li.

159
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,220
So, while pretending to escort Madam
to her hometown before labor,

160
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,750
he was secretly rushing to the capital
to deliver the message.

161
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,820
Later, he was informed

162
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,950
that the Imperial Guards
led by the Crown Prince

163
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,010
had been ambushed at the Storm Ridge.

164
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,580
That was the current Emperor's first time

165
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,710
to command a troop as the Crown Prince.

166
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,080
By the time he realized it was a trap,

167
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,420
he had been surrounded
by arrows dipped in tung oil.

168
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,470
Prince Yi hurried to the Storm Ridge
overnight

169
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,190
and single-handedly rescued
the Emperor from raging flames.

170
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,990
Regrettably,

171
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,450
the reinforcements arrived

172
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,850
only to find Prince Yi had been burned
beyond recognition.

173
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,220
Yet until his dying breath,
he had been guarding in front of

174
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,950
the severely injured Emperor.

175
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,970
The Emperor was deeply moved
by Yan Han's loyalty.

176
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,100
After ascending the throne,
His Majesty overruled all objections

177
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,500
and honored Yan as "Prince Yi"

178
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,100
in memory of his allegiance.

179
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,090
The Emperor also took Yan Li in
as his godson

180
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,280
and bestowed upon him
the imperial surname,

181
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,870
"Yan."

182
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,740
So, Yan Li is just
an honorary heir of a prince.

183
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,980
None of the capital's bigwigs

184
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,580
truly consider him
as part of the royal family.

185
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,880
Why wasn't Madam granted
the title of princess?

186
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,010
Mrs. Yan meant to join Yan Han in death,

187
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,310
but she couldn't bear the thought of

188
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,700
Yan Li becoming parentless at a young age.

189
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,670
After declining rewards and honors,

190
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,030
she started living in seclusion.

191
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,390
Fortunately, Grandmother

192
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,580
treats Yan Li like her own grandson.

193
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,550
As long as Grandmother lives,

194
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,750
nobody in the palace
would dare to openly disrespect him.

195
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,520
A lifelong commitment...

196
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
Madam and Prince Yi

197
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,660
really loved each other dearly.

198
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,580
I suppose this wooden hairpin contains

199
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,030
Madam's wish for us to be

200
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,850
a loving couple forever.

201
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,020
But if misfortunes befall you,

202
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,490
I'll definitely not join you in death.

203
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,400
I'll search every corner on earth

204
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,720
to hunt down

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
those who harmed you.

206
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
Your words...

207
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,920
have really put my mind...

208
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,100
at ease.

209
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,890
You can rest assured.

210
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,280
Even if you die,

211
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,770
I'll carry on with my life.

212
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,180
I'm assured.

213
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,380
You can rest assured too.

214
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,330
By no means I'll die before you do.

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,600
Master!

216
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,480
[Capital Prefecture]

217
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,910
I misled

218
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,700
those spies
to the Maquis of Zhongyong's mansion.

219
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,450
Have the Dove Unit

220
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,740
take them for a tour around the capital,

221
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,010
so they can't get in our way.

222
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,570
Got it.

223
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,500
Your Highness,

224
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,190
Master Wan,

225
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,700
I have a small finding now.

226
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,710
The capital prefect has been waiting.

227
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,840
Please lead the way, Constable Zhang.

228
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,460
No intimate contact here.

229
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,130
I won't share a carriage with you anymore.

230
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,460
Not here?

231
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,610
Then anywhere else is fine?

232
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,290
Thank you for coming.

233
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,430
I was just wondering

234
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,670
where the perpetrator captured
these three victims,

235
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,980
since there is zero connection
among these girls,

236
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,880
and their workplaces are far from

237
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,500
where their bodies were dumped.

238
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,980
No need to rush, Capital Prefect.

239
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,270
Constable Zhan, can you

240
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,530
get us some red strings,

241
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,090
red pens

242
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,340
and pins?

243
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,610
Sure.

244
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,420
What does Your Highness need those for?

245
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,620
The murderer hasn't left a trail.

246
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,520
It means this person acts

247
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
with extreme caution and prudence.

248
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,700
People of this kind

249
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,030
usually commit crimes in familiar places

250
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,820
and premeditate the timing

251
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,670
and routes.

252
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,100
This perpetrator kills every half a month.

253
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,860
If he ran a tailor shop independently,

254
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,980
he wouldn't have the time

255
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,820
to look around for preys in the capital.

256
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,460
If his shop were frequently closed,

257
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,390
it would surely arouse suspicion.

258
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,200
So,

259
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,390
the three places
where he dumped the bodies

260
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,450
can tell us the possible murder site.

261
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,930
But these places
aren't close to one another.

262
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,080
Your Highness.

263
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,150
Constable Zhan,

264
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,410
please put these pins

265
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,570
onto the map,

266
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,560
where the murderer disposed of the bodies.

267
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,730
The first victim

268
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,460
was found under Yushui Bridge.

269
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,340
The second victim

270
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,070
was left in an abandoned house.

271
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,030
The third one

272
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,560
was discovered in an alley.

273
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,230
Red strings.

274
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,740
The curfew starts at 11 p.m.,

275
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,310
and is lifted at 3 a.m..

276
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,310
To avoid being spotted,

277
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,270
the murderer had to discard the bodies

278
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,150
and return home
within this period of time.

279
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,620
Besides, he couldn't use trolleys

280
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,310
or horses to transport the bodies.

281
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,980
It is hard for an average-sized adult man

282
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,700
to walk four to five li within two hours

283
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,340
while carrying a body

284
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,150
weighing about 50 kilograms.

285
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,500
Plus the time spent in resting,

286
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,390
hiding from patrols

287
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,580
and dealing with the bodies,

288
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,500
it would take at least three hours.

289
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,670
The rest of the time would be just enough
for him to go home

290
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,270
and prepare to open the shop.

291
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,090
This area is

292
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,500
no more than five li away

293
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,630
from each dump site.

294
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:07,990
Bai Feng,

295
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,790
take some people with you

296
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,240
and look for the shops

297
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,220
with stairways.

298
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,580
The murderer could be a tailor,

299
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,820
and his shop

300
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,950
might be rented.

301
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,030
I got it.

302
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,070
Don't just check the shops.

303
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,790
As His Highness said,

304
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,270
the perpetrator is meticulous.

305
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:21,980
He probably has

306
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,840
a different hideout in this area.

307
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,070
Make sure you check
every house with stairways.

308
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,700
Yes.

309
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,220
Bai Feng.

310
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,340
In just a few hours,

311
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,740
we'll hit the deadline.

312
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,580
Take this token with you.

313
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,910
Ignore today's curfew.

314
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,740
Set out now.

315
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,410
Your Highness,

316
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,460
I have found some diners

317
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,280
that sell fish porridge
in the West Market.

318
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,630
I'll go with you to the West Market

319
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,580
to interview the fish vendors.

320
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,100
Okay.

321
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,690
I want to go to the morgue

322
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,180
to see if I can find new clues
from the bodies.

323
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,910
I will accompany Master Wan.

324
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

325
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,940
If anything happens,

326
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,610
remember to use the Red Flare.

327
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,790
I'm just a lowly prostitute.

328
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,090
How am I able to afford your education?

329
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,620
Why do you have to be a boy?

330
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,270
Why are you a boy?

331
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,180
Tell me.

332
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,060
Why can't you be a girl?

333
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,859
Why...

334
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,210
Why aren't you a girl?

335
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,530
If you were a girl,

336
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,940
I could pimp you out

337
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,819
for money.

338
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,609
Why do you have to be a boy?

339
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,920
Why?

340
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,829
Why do you have to be a boy?

341
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,390
Get me more liquor.

342
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,980
Your Highness,

343
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,260
there is a message

344
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,990
from the Marquis of Zhongyong.

345
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,260
The coroner I recommended

346
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,540
has found some clues.

347
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,410
Chi is

348
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,950
hunting for the suspect.

349
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,050
What else did the marquis say?

350
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,740
His Grace

351
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,950
told Your Highness not to worry.

352
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,500
Good.

353
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,910
If this case can be solved on time,

354
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,190
the Marquis of Zhongyong
will surely be rewarded.

355
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,740
[Morgue]

356
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,850
Capital Prefect.

357
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,500
Mr. Fang.

358
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,870
Where are the three victims' bodies?

359
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,700
Their bodies?

360
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,670
Capital Prefect, didn't you just order

361
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,880
the bodies to be taken away?

362
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,440
I never gave that order.

363
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,350
What about the victims' clothes?

364
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,810
Taken away too, of course.

365
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,270
I was truly baffled.

366
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,710
It's freezing cold now.

367
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,020
The bodies could've been buried

368
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,870
after the case is closed.

369
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,350
Do you know who took the bodies away?

370
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,190
I certainly do.

371
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,060
That was the officer
who brought the bodies over

372
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,790
last time with Constable Zhan.

373
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,670
It's Prince Cheng's doing again.

374
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,980
How could this happen?

375
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,210
He took all the evidence away.

376
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,810
How are we supposed to solve the case?

377
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,990
Let's go back to the prefect's office.

378
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,720
His Highness will
definitely find new evidence.

379
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,590
Gentlemen,

380
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,920
you came early.

381
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,100
The cooking has just started.

382
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,980
In the West Market,

383
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,110
our fish porridge

384
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,430
has the most authentic local flavor.

385
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,030
Serve some side dishes first.

386
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,110
We'd like to taste

387
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,980
your famous local-flavored porridge.

388
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,310
Alright, just a moment.

389
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,750
Your Highness, do you think

390
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,970
this is where the third victim

391
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,010
last ate?

392
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,540
The third victim

393
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,810
lived outside the city.

394
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,220
She rarely came in town for procurements.

395
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,550
I bet she'd love to taste

396
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,490
the most authentic
local-flavored fish porridge.

397
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,110
Food's coming!

398
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,020
Mister,

399
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,150
look at this sachet of yours.

400
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,540
Are you getting married soon?

401
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,740
You're mistaken, sir.

402
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,260
This sachet isn't mine.

403
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,850
Previously, a young lady
came for porridge

404
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,130
and left it behind.

405
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,150
Well,

406
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,150
I thought she'd come back for it,

407
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,490
so I hung it on my waist
for it to be easily noticed.

408
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,640
Do you remember

409
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,520
what that young lady was wearing?

410
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,760
She was in...

411
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,560
ordinary ko-hemp, as I recall.

412
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,760
Your Highness,

413
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,090
the third victim

414
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,370
was exactly wearing ko-hemp clothes.

415
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,640
I-Is that young lady dead?

416
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,310
Then...

417
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,260
this sachet...

418
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,840
How...

419
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,550
should I...

420
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,870
This is a contract about the making of
a wedding dress.

421
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,470
The pickup date is precisely

422
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,320
the day of the victim's missing.

423
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,110
Shopkeeper!

424
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,020
Sir.

425
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,190
Sit down, miss.

426
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,430
Have some tea.

427
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,960
Take a rest.

428
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,460
Thank you.

429
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,450
There are only a few stitches to make.

430
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,220
The dress will be finished soon.

431
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,080
Thank you, sir.

432
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,400
How kind of you.

433
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,630
It's Jinyi Shop!

434
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,880
Bai Feng,

435
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,320
follow the map to find Jinyi Shop.

436
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,800
Catch the murderer.

437
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,190
All the physical evidence
has gone missing now,

438
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,060
so we can't afford to
lose the testimonies too.

439
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,590
Yes!

440
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,050
Prefect Zheng,

441
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,260
even if we capture the culprit as planned,

442
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,350
without physical evidence,

443
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,430
Prince Cheng can still make false claims.

444
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,740
What is there to do then?

445
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,090
I suggest you submit
a penitential memorial.

446
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,720
It's time for Master Wan to leave

447
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,370
and prepare to attend the royal banquet.

448
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,870
I'll write the memorial right away.

449
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,620
Master Wan,

450
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,630
I deeply appreciate your help.

451
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,260
Now, you need to think about
tonight's royal banquet.

452
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,320
Isn't it time for the Emperor
to meet the talent I hired?

453
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,020
Do I really have to go?

454
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,830
The Marquis of Zhongyong

455
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,690
would definitely make Qin Wan go.

456
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,780
[Capital Prefecture]

457
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm not going.

458
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,590
It's the annual New Year's
royal gathering.

459
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,980
You've been absent from it every year.

460
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,260
This is a family reunion.

461
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,660
How could you not join us?

462
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,460
Which of those people is my family?

463
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,540
I didn't share the same surname with them

464
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,740
until 20 years ago.

465
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,410
I'd hate to be a bother.

466
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,480
I'd better spare them
from the awkwardness of having an outsider

467
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,340
like me around.

468
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,860
How are you an outsider?

469
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm leaving now.

470
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,380
You...

471
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,840
Tomorrow morning,

472
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,460
I'll pay a New Year's visit to Madam.

473
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,190
Okay!

474
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,580
I'll be waiting for you.

475
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,960
What are you doing here?

476
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,500
Chi specially asked me
to prepare clothes and jewelry for you.

477
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,190
I also need to

478
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,430
instruct you on court etiquette
and codes of conduct.

479
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,260
You have no idea

480
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,740
how calculating and cunning

481
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,980
the capital's noble ladies are.

482
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,430
How can I send you to the lion's den

483
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,020
without giving you some tips first?

484
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,150
What do I have to fear?

485
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,670
I'll just pretend not to
understand anything,

486
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,630
being all quiet and still.

487
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,500
Let them scheme with all they can—
it'll all be useless!

488
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,870
Impressive. What a smart strategy—

489
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,980
playing dumb.

490
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,170
Ning,

491
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,460
I have only one reminder for you.

492
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,190
During the royal banquet,

493
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,870
I'll be visiting the Empress Dowager
in Funing Palace.

494
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,330
If anyone bullies you two,

495
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,590
don't hesitate to fight back.

496
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,460
The blood of resistance
runs in our family.

497
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,630
Everyone knows about
Grandmother's hot temper.

498
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,320
Chi,

499
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,460
you should be telling me

500
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,190
not to strike too hard instead.

501
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,260
Chi,

502
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,780
why didn't you ask Little Wan'er

503
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,630
what she fed you before eating it?

504
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,960
Wan offered it to me.
Did I even need to ask?

505
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,700
This pill helps him stay sober.

506
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,220
Not exactly alcohol-proof,

507
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
but your tolerance will skyrocket.

508
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,360
I want one too.

509
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,840
Why do you get to be a woman,

510
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,210
and I don't?

511
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,830
You're merely the daughter of
the Duke of Zhong.

512
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,730
[Yan Zhen]
[A royal princess]

513
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,700
How dare you sit next to me.

514
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,780
Who do you think you are?

515
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,050
[Feng Chenbi]

516
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,400
Maids,

517
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
get her a new seat.

518
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,220
His Majesty commanded Noble Consort Su
to preside over this banquet,

519
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,550
so my seating here

520
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,370
carries his imperial sanction.

521
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,150
Your Highness had better
mind your manners.

522
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,150
Otherwise,

523
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,410
you'll be a disgrace to the Empress.

524
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,000
The girl in the chief seat

525
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,600
is Princess Yan Zhen,
the Empress's daughter.

526
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,060
The girl in the secondary seat

527
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
is Feng Chenbi,

528
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,160
whose father, the Duke of Zhong, is
Noble Consort Su's confidant.

529
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,090
These two girls

530
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,390
are arch nemeses.

531
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,350
But whenever Qin Zhaoyu shows up,

532
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,680
they two will immediately become allies.

533
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,130
Is Feng Chenbi

534
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,410
also into the Crown Prince?

535
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,460
Not all the rivalries among noble ladies

536
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,790
throughout history are about men, right?

537
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,190
This banquet was organized
by Noble Consort Su.

538
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,660
The Empress didn't take part in it at all.

539
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,790
So, you can see

540
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,920
who's having an edge now.

541
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,910
Royal concubines fight one another
with all means

542
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,560
only for their children's sake.

543
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,490
A mother's favor elevates her son.

544
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,510
That's why Prince Cheng always has
the upper hand over the Crown Prince.

545
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,820
It is also why the Qin family
is facing many obstacles

546
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,210
in its every attempt

547
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,560
to marry a daughter into the royal family.

548
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,610
A boisterous occasion, isn't it?

549
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,340
Yes, indeed.

550
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,610
Your aunt

551
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,600
should've taken the lowest seat.

552
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,650
But the Empress likes Qin Zhaoyu a lot,

553
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,650
so your aunt could get a seat
in the middle row.

554
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,640
Speaking of which,

555
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,460
given your help to the Crown Prince
this time,

556
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,790
the Empress might treat you differently.

557
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,120
If that happens...

558
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,430
The Emperor arrives!

559
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,820
[Zhao Shuhua]
[Empress]

560
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,080
[Feng Lingsu]
[Noble Consort Su]

561
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,700
Greetings, Your Majesty!

562
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,570
The Empress Dowager
is feeling slightly unwell.

563
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,920
I'll keep you company on her behalf.

564
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,700
Everyone,

565
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,330
just make yourself at home.

566
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,500
Thank Your Majesty.

567
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,590
Rise.

568
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,420
Ning,

569
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,430
is the lady beside you

570
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,870
the Grand Princess's

571
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,390
god-granddaughter?

572
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,610
Yes, Your Majesty,

573
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,240
she is.

574
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,510
I'm Qin Wan. Greetings, Your Majesty.

575
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,930
I wish Your Majesty
longevity and wellness.

576
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,260
Forgo the formalities.

577
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,990
Thank Your Majesty.

578
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,490
The Grand Princess

579
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,570
has told me what you did

580
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,910
in Jingzhou.

581
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,990
In the letter,

582
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,590
she particularly asked me

583
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,590
to take good care of

584
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,910
her dear

585
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,050
Wan.

586
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,500
If not,

587
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,580
she'll come to the capital with her whip.

588
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,630
I am

589
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,040
very much frightened.

590
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,590
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

591
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,390
I promise I'll take good care of myself

592
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,110
and not worry the Grand Princess.

593
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,520
Don't concern about me, Your Majesty.

594
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,540
The prescription I made
for the Grand Princess

595
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,150
is nerve-soothing.

596
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,460
Her Highness

597
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,590
hasn't raised her whip for a long time.

598
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,430
Are Miss Qin's medical skills

599
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,490
really good enough

600
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
to change

601
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,020
a person's temperament?

602
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,100
Your Majesty,

603
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,840
I'm an eyewitness

604
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,350
to Wan's medical competence.

605
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,060
In Jingzhou,

606
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,390
people all refer to her
as a medical fairy.

607
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,950
What a surprise
that the Marquis of Zhongyong

608
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,950
has a medical fairy as his daughter.

609
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,020
He is a blessed father.

610
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
That's a much higher honor

611
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,520
than the hollow title
of the capital's most talented woman.

612
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,410
Women excel in different fields.

613
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,220
Why compare them with one another?

614
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,830
Be they good at arts, medicine,

615
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,260
needlework, cooking or anything,

616
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,460
they deserve respect and admiration

617
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,660
as long as they are

618
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,440
sensible women of integrity.

619
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,190
Well said.

620
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,330
I can't agree more with

621
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,670
Miss Qin's opinion.

622
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,670
Return to your seats, ladies.

623
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,800
Thank Your Majesty.

624
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,800
Why are you still out here?

625
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,260
Are you waiting for me?

626
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,280
Or are you afraid

627
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,180
that Father will ask you

628
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,780
about those women's murders?

629
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,240
Had I known you cared
so much about this case,

630
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,760
I would've asked Father
to let you handle it.

631
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,150
You are the Crown Prince
who protects the capital,

632

while I'm just the inferior Prince Cheng.

633
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,540
How could I compare myself
with Your Highness?

May Your Majesty be well in the new year.

in the new year.

though this is a family gathering,
I still have to make a report.

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,590
on this New Year's Eve,

679
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,830
while the people are celebrating,

680
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,780
I can't help but

681
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,740
think of those brutally murdered girls

682
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,140
and their families.

683
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,450
It really unsettles me.

684
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,540
How can they spend
this joyous occasion happily

685
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,110
with grief and anger
weighing on their hearts?

686
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,720
The time limit has been reached.

687
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,610
Crown Prince, please give updates

688
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,430
on the investigation of this case,

689
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,230
so as to ease the people's minds.

690
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,500
Father,

691
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,890
significant progress has been made
for this case.

692
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,420
It will be solved very soon.

693
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,670
What progress?

694
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,360
I...

695
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,310
I...

696
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,950
I

697
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,940
have a report to present.

698
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,910
I'll allow it.

699
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Your Majesty,

700
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,950
the case about the murdered girls

701
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,210
was just solved today.

702
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,950
The Crown Prince was reluctant

703
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,490
to bring it up in the royal banquet
on the New Year's Eve,

704
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,620
so I didn't dare to present the report.

705
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,820
This memorial was written
by the capital prefect

706
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,870
to state the conclusion of this case.

707
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,530
Please read it, Your Majesty.

708
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,330
The cold-blooded and brutal murderer

709
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,489
failed to take another girl's life,
thanks to the timely arrival of

710
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:25,020
Constable Zhan
from the capital prefecture.

711
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
This tailor

712
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,159
committed gruesome murders
out of jealousy of

713
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,760
women marrying up.

714
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,310
How astounding it is

715
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,590
to uncover

716
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,949
such a vicious murderer

717
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,710
in my reign!

718
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,150
Your Majesty,

719
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,449
this person

720
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,179
was traumatized from being abused

721
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,710
in childhood by his mother.

722
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,810
This brutal killer deserves no sympathy.

723
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,639
It has to be made clear
that his motive was purely personal

724
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,120
and unrelated to Your Majesty's reign.

725
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,350
The fact that this bizarre murder case

726
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,310
could be solved within several days

727
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,230
exactly proves

728
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,540
Your Majesty's administration
effective and reliable.

729
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,460
Good.

730
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,980
Rise and talk.

731
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,830
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank Your Majesty.

732
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,500
The Crown Prince and the capital prefect

733
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,900
have both done a good job.

734
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,140
Besides, I've noticed

735
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,330
from the capital prefect's memorial

736
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,910
that some obvious clues

737
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,500
were revealed

738
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,690
by

739
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,040
the coroner.

740
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,830
How come this talent

741
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,710
hadn't made

742
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,640
any notable achievements before?

743
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,290
Your Majesty,

744
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,860
this coroner

745
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,940
was recently recommended
by the Crown Prince's royal guardian—

746
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,710
Qin Shu,

747
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,200
the Marquis of Zhongyong.

748
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,420
Your Majesty,

749
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,980
for the wellbeing of the country,

750
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,380
I'd gladly do anything
within my capacity.

751
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,910
Mr. Qin,

752
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,320
I appreciate it.

753
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,120
Your Majesty,

754
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,910
there is

755
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,820
a memorial asking for punishment

756
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,270
awaiting your review.

757
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,040
The capital prefect

758
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,830
admits that he failed to
keep the evidence safe

759
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,690
and is now asking for punishment.

760
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,180
This...

761
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,830
The victims' clothes went missing.

762
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,620
Their bodies were destroyed.

763
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,230
I can't believe

764
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,640
the capital prefecture would make

765
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,490
such a huge mistake right under my nose!

766
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,310
I vouch for the capital prefect.

767
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,710
Every word in the memorial

768
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,840
is absolutely true.

769
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,960
In that case,

770
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,270
I'll assign you

771
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,420
to arrest those

772
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,320
who destroyed the evidence

773
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,060
and obstructed the official investigation

774
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,910
immediately.

775
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,330
Yes,

776
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,920
as Your Majesty commands.

777
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,820
Crown Prince,

778
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,060
you dealt with this matter properly

779
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,170
and meticulously.

780
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,920
As we are

781
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,400
celebrating the New Year,

782
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,430
maintaining

783
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,930
the peace and prosperity of the country is

784
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,430
indeed our priority.

785
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,980
Thank you for your praise, Father.

786
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,600
Alright.

787
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,240
Be seated then, everyone.

788
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,570
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank Your Majesty.

789
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,830
Come on,

790
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,670
raise your glasses.

791
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,430
Let us

792
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,460
toast to

793
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,230
a prosperous new year.

794
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,870
May Your Majesty be well in the new year.

795
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,920
[Empress Dowager]

796
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,090
Your Majesty!

797
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,780
Are you feeling unwell, Your Highness?

798
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,910
All this coughing is making my chest ache.

799
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,840
Shall I ask for a royal physician?

800
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,390
No need.

801
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,060
It happens every year.

802
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,840
This is the New Year's Eve.

803
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,640
I'd hate to disturb the Emperor.

804
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,300
My chest feels very tight.

805
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,690
Help me step out for some fresh air.

806
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,350
Yes.

807
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,620
Slowly.

808
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,650
Your Majesty?

809
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,630
Your Majesty?

810
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,780
Your Majesty!

811
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,840
Your Majesty!

812
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,230
Help!

813
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,540
Get the royal physicians here!

814
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,850
Go to Chongming Palace

815
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,480
to inform the Emperor now!

816
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,280
Yes.

817
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,660
Your Majesty?

818
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:01,970
Your Majesty?

819
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,650
Let the evil-repelling ritual commence!

820
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,660
The player of that general

821
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,930
must be from the Imperial Guards.

822
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,790
He has excellent martial skills.

823
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,430
Indeed.

824
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,020
Very good.

825
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,360
I, Yan Chi,

826
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,660
wish Your Majesty

827
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,990
a lifetime of wellness!

828
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,290
He...

829
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,140
He's Chi, isn't he?

830
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,020
In the blink of an eye,

831
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,100
how did you go from a real general

832
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,910
to a fake one?

833
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,820
Your Majesty,

834
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,100
the people will benefit from

835
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,020
your wisdom.

836
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,980
I stand ready to repel all evil

837
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,060
for Your Majesty,

838
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,980
as it is also my duty.

839
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,910
Good.

840
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,870
I'd love to hear that!

841
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,230
Now,

842
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,870
you're the vice minister of
the Ministry of Justice.

843
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,630
You shall

844
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,000
safeguard the country's peace for me.

845
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,590
Thank Your Majesty!

846
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,870
Alright.

847
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,790
You may rise.

848
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,920
Thank Your Majesty.

849
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,790
How

850
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,710
considerate of Chi.

851
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,840
Now that the ritual is over,

852
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,050
Empress,

853
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,270
let's go to

854
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,580
Zhenghua Gate

855
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,510
to celebrate this occasion

856
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,950
with all the commoners.

857
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,950
Yes, as Your Majesty commands.

858
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:53,460
Good.

859
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,460
Your Majesty!

860
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,430
Your Majesty,

861
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,280
the Empress Dowager...

862
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,740
is in critical condition!

863
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,260
How come?

864
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,540
Her Majesty suddenly fell ill.

865
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,460
Then...

866
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,180
why didn't she ask for a royal physician?

867
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,020
All the royal physicians are

868
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,430
in Funing Palace now.

869
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,660
The problem is,

870
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,230
Her Majesty can't ingest any medical soup.

871
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,060
Her Majesty is lingering

872
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,390
between life and death!

873
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,110
Prepare my carriage!

874
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,620
Little Wan'er,

875
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,750
please go check on the Empress Dowager.

876
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,950
She treats me nicely.

877
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,100
The situation is unclear now.

878
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,870
Any rash decisions could
turn us into someone else's pawns.

879
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,100
Don't worry. If possible,

880
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,560
I'll definitely help her.

881
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,170
Okay.

882
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,900
Your Majesty.

883
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:50,620
Your Majesty,

884
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,750
this is the beginning of a new year.

885
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,580
If the people

886
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,470
can't see the Emperor, the Empress
and the Crown Prince,

887
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,620
I'm afraid they'll be thrown into panic.

888
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,350
Your Majesty!

889
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,660
Your Majesty, the country's wellness
comes before anything!
