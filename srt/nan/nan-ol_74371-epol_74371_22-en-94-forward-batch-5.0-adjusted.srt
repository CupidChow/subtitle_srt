[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,120
Your Majesty.

4
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,820
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,950
At the beginning of the new year,

6
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,479
if the people don't see the Emperor,
Empress, and Crown Prince,

7
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,350
it may cause unrest.

8
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,759
Your Majesty,

9
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,160
please put the welfare
of the nation first.

10
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,000
The Empress Dowager is gravely ill.

11
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,940
I'm in no mood to celebrate
with the people.

12
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,509
Your Majesty,

13
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,039
the Empress Dowager's condition

14
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,000
is still unclear and critical.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,950
I believe

16
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,970
you should first visit her
at Funing Palace,

17
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,210
then go to Zhenghua Gate

18
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,920
once her condition stabilizes.

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,120
The people will surely understand
your filial devotion.

20
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,740
Your Highness, do you remember
that medical fairy?

21
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,230
What medical fairy?

22
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,160
Please be careful with your words.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,120
Why?

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,770
Didn't Miss Qin earn that title

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,390
after saving the Grand Princess?

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,920
That can't be false, can it?

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,410
What's all the noise over there?

28
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,510
Father,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,310
Miss Qin from the Qin family is known as
the "medical fairy."

30
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,240
She must have a way to save Grandma.

31
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,510
Your Majesty,

32
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,730
my ninth sister's
so-called title of "medical fairy"

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,800
is just local gossip from Jingzhou.

34
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,510
She's still youngâ€”

35
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,270
hardly worthy of such a title.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,920
Whether it's gossip or not,

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
she did cure Great Aunt, didn't she?

38
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,600
Chi.

39
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,750
Yes.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
Is what they say

41
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,250
about Miss Qin being the "medical fairy"

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,590
true?

43
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,660
Miss Qin

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,960
did treat the Grand Princess.

45
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,860
Are you confident you can cure
the Empress Dowager?

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,470
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,770
I am willing to try my best.

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,070
This concerns the Empress Dowager's life.

50
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,030
How can I let you just "try"?

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,579
when I said I'd try my best,

53
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,920
I meant I haven't yet examined
Her Majesty.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,360
Doctors are not gods.

55
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,040
Without seeing the patient,

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,470
I cannot say for sure.

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,840
So whether I should try or not

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
is for you to decide.

59
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,600
So you're saying

60
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,290
if you cure her, it's your skill;

61
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,870
if you don't,

62
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,420
it's His Majesty's fault for choosing you?

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,060
You're quite calculating

64
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,050
for someone so young.

65
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,840
It's just a child's foolish words.

66
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,770
Please forgive her, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,310
Your Majesty,

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,490
Miss Qin is still young.

69
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,900
Though talented,

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,350
her experience is limited.

71
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,350
It's better to let
the imperial physicians handle it.

72
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,300
Empress, Crown Prince,

73
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,150
go to Zhenghua Gate immediately.

74
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,750
I will join you shortly.

75
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,700
This concerns the Empress Dowager's
safety.

76
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,950
I will personally take you
to Funing Palace.

77
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,880
Get in the carriage!

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,540
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,500
Your Majesty, please wake up.

81
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,990
Your Majesty, please wake up.

82
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,570
-Your Majesty.
-Ma'am Chen.

83
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,720
At this point,

84
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,680
it's better to report to His Majesty

85
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,270
and make early...

86
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,070
Early what?

87
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,220
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

88
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,180
Her Majesty's pulse indicates danger.

89
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,440
And yesterday, Chief Physician Hu
suddenly fell ill and is unable to come.

90
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,400
I've tried every method,

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,270
but...

92
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,100
Miss Qin,

93
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,170
come.

94
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,830
How is the Empress Dowager?

95
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,800
There's no external injury on her head.

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,170
There is blood in her nasal cavity,

97
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,770
but none on her lips or mouth.

98
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,430
She has dark bruising around her eyes,

99
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,510
purple lips,

100
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,730
swollen internal organs,

101
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,990
and rigid, paralyzed limbs.

102
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,630
This is caused by cold invading
her liver and spleen,

103
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,630
leading to ulcers
from prolonged accumulation.

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,730
Cold penetrated the muscles of her limbs.

105
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,550
She should often feel numbness and
coldness in her legs, making sleep difficult.

106
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,340
Ma'am Chen,

107
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,130
did Her Majesty vomit during the day?

108
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,390
Tell the truth. Do not hide anything.

109
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,870
Yes.

110
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,970
Besides numbness in her legs,

111
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,870
does Her Majesty also feel stabbing pain?

112
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,110
Has she been unable to speak

113
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,670
since she fell?

114
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,240
My Lady, you're right.

115
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,190
During the day,

116
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,860
after lunch, Her Majesty did vomit.

117
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,140
While resting,
she felt numbness and pain in her legs,

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,940
so she ate very little at dinner.

119
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,920
After she fell,

120
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,250
there was blood in her nose.

121
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,220
Afterwards,
she not only lost the ability to speak

122
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,880
but also became unconscious.

123
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,220
Were you by her side

124
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,650
when she fell?

125
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,440
Yes.

126
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,570
I tried to hold her,

127
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,860
but couldn't support her fully,

128
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,060
so she fell onto me.

129
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,690
Ma'am Chen held Her Majesty just in time.

130
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,020
The nosebleed and unconsciousness
are likely unrelated to external injury.

131
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,810
Your Majesty, I can confirm

132
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,100
Her Majesty's coma is caused
by pathogenic wind affecting the brain,

133
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,450
resulting in pressure on the vessels.

134
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,210
Well...

135
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,520
can you save her?

136
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,270
Has it been two hours

137
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,430
since Her Majesty fell ill?

138
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,290
It will be two hours in 45 minutes.

139
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,860
Your Majesty, the first two hours

140
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,080
are the optimal time
for treating wind symptoms.

141
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,310
If you trust me,

142
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,870
I'll try my best.

143
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,070
Very well.

144
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,860
Whatever you need,

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,530
they will cooperate fully.

146
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

147
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,450
Ma'am Chen, please bring me
Her Majesty's prescription.

148
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,210
Here.

149
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,590
This prescription is excellent.

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,870
It just needs two mace

151
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,400
each of Tianlong and Dilong.

152
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,480
These two herbs

153
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,930
promote blood circulation
and remove stasis

154
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,200
but are toxic.

155
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,410
Her Majesty's Qi and blood are weak.

156
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,010
How could she withstand
such strong medicine?

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,480
If it harms her lifespan...

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,460
Strong medicine cures disease;

159
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,550
harsh measures
are for critical conditions.

160
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,870
If she dies,

161
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,270
what use are Qi and blood?

162
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,600
Let alone her lifespan.

163
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,180
But Her Majesty has lost the ability
to swallow.

164
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,090
If the decoction can't be administered,

165
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,290
it's useless.

166
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,640
Wait until she regains consciousness
to give her the decoction,

167
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,820
so it doesn't enter her airway

168
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,280
and cause further danger.

169
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,770
Since it's dangerous,

170
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,680
why did you force
the medicine on her earlier?

171
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,020
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

172
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,750
We tried everything to wake Her Majesty,

173
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,350
but nothing worked.

174
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,549
We had no choice
but to try this last resort.

175
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,140
You...

176
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,200
Your Majesty,

177
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,909
before administering the medicine,

178
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,179
the imperial physicians
have bled her philtrum

179
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,070
and the hand-specific Jing-Well points.

180
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,510
The treatment itself was proper,

181
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,710
but it was too cautious to be effective.

182
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,080
Too cautious?

183
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm afraid they were more concerned
with avoiding blame

184
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,940
than achieving results.

185
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,030
Your Majesty, physicians are not gods.

186
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,500
It's impossible for us
to cure every illness instantly.

187
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,890
If they're punished for every failure,

188
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,480
how could they not hesitate

189
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,230
and worry about consequences?

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
Your Majesty,

191
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,690
please forgive Miss Qin.
She is still young.

192
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,520
Since Miss Qin

193
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,030
has spoken on your behalf,

194
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,420
you may all rise.

195
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

196
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
What are you waiting for?

197
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
Go prepare the medicine!

198
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,200
Okay. The medicine.

199
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,490
Ma'am Chen,

200
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,990
please boil a strong pot of water
with Atractylodes, mugwort,

201
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,530
and sweet flag added, for external use.

202
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,990
-Yes.
-Yes.

203
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,680
Your Majesty,

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,870
it's about time.

205
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,610
Many citizens are waiting at Zhenghua Gate

206
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,900
for a glimpse of Your Majesty.

207
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,780
Will you still be going?

208
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,720
Miss Qin,

209
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,730
I

210
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,200
only have one question for youâ€”

211
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,200
can you save the Empress Dowager?

212
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,630
I will remain calm and focused,

213
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,180
treat Her Majesty like my family,

214
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,120
and dedicate all my knowledge

215
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,850
wholeheartedly to saving her.

216
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:27,070
[Funing Palace]

217
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,560
Chi,

218
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,240
I entrust your grandmother

219
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,670
to you and Miss Qin.

220
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,200
Uncle, please don't worry.

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,100
Since Miss Qin said

222
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,830
there's still a chance for her,

223
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,050
She will undoubtedly pull through.

224
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,040
Let's hope so.

225
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,870
Tomorrow is the New Year's Court Assembly.

226
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,670
Envoys from Beidai and Xihan

227
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,070
will attend to pay respects.

228
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,910
These two countries
have always been at odds.

229
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,960
If not for the internal rebellions
they both experienced last year,

230
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
they might have already gone to war.

231
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
While the envoys are in the capital,

232
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
you must keep a close watch

233
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,290
and ensure they don't cause

234
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,700
any incidents within our borders.

235
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

236
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,450
How is it going?

237
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,510
Please wait a moment, Your Highness.

238
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,200
The eighth techniques of the Golden Needle
from Medicine King Valley

239
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,370
require needle application timed to Qi-blood tides.

240
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,870
The calculations are very complex.

241
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,530
Miss Qin cannot be disturbed.

242
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,290
Alright.

243
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,960
Chi, how is Grandmother?

244
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,270
No news yet.

245
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,810
His Majesty is here!

246
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,270
How is the Empress Dowager?

247
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,730
No news has been reported.

248
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,390
Your Majesty!

249
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,660
Wait here, you all!

250
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,430
Chi.

251
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,480
What are we going to do?

252
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,720
What should we do now?

253
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,130
The medicine needs time to take effect.

254
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,580
Please be patient.

255
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

256
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,160
Mother.

257
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,520
Mother!

258
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm here.

259
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,240
Thank you for your efforts.

260
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,970
Mother.

261
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,960
Miss Qin,

262
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,560
this...

263
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
What happened to the Empress Dowager?

264
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,270
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

265
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,080
Her Majesty has fallen asleep again.

266
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,510
When she wakes, she will need another
dose of the life-sustaining decoction,

267
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,900
and a third dose at noon.

268
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,270
If she can take all doses without issue,

269
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,600
her condition will be considered stable.

270
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,310
Father, is Grandmother alright?

271
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,220
Your Majesty, is Her Majesty...

272
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,480
Heaven has blessed us.

273
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,900
The Empress Dowager is out of danger now.

274
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,590
Alright, the New Year's Court Assembly

275
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,560
begins in six hours.

276
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,200
You all should head back and rest.

277
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,360
Yes, Father.

278
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,040
I shall take my leave.

279
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,240
Your Majesty, although Her Majesty
is no longer in danger,

280
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,840
she still requires careful treatment.

281
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,030
I'd like to discuss
the recovery prescription

282
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,270
with Physician Zhang

283
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,800
and leave the palace later.

284
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,920
Leave?

285
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,540
For what?

286
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,550
Yuan Qing.

287
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,580
I'm here, Your Majesty.

288
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,220
Prepare the side chamber.

289
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,280
Tonight, have Miss Qin

290
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,490
stay in the Empress Dowager's palace.

291
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:17,970
Yes.

292
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,830
Your Majesty, Her Majesty's condition
is gradually improving.

293
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,180
It might be best not to confine Miss Qin
within the palace.

294
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,650
She grew up in Medicine King Valley

295
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,150
and fears restrictions the most.

296
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,080
She might feel uncomfortable
staying in the palace.

297
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't fully trust
those imperial physicians.

298
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,620
The imperial physicians
are quite experienced and prudent.

299
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,200
They were simply concerned
about Her Majesty's frailty

300
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,860
and thus hesitated
to use strong medicines.

301
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,840
With Physician Zhang's
excellent pulse diagnosis,

302
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,510
she will surely recover.

303
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,190
Yuan Qing,

304
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,990
bring me my jade token.

305
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,770
Well, Miss Qin, you'll need to

306
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,130
travel back and forth to the palace daily.

307
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,670
With this jade token,

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,470
your access

309
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,450
will be easier.

310
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

311
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,960
I will enter the palace at 9 a.m.
every morning

312
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,620
to check Her Majesty's pulse.

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,600
Very well.

314
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,310
No need to trouble
two people for one thing.

315
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,240
Chi,

316
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,320
escort Miss Qin home now.

317
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,130
Thank you for speaking up for me today.

319
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,030
Otherwise, I would have opposed
His Majesty again.

320
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,270
I really fear being confined
in the palace,

321
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,240
as then I wouldn't be able
to investigate my father's case.

322
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,520
His Majesty is stern

323
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,020
and decisive.

324
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,800
Today, you stood up to him
for the imperial physicians.

325
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,960
I was truly frightened.

326
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,870
At that moment, I was only worried that

327
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,150
Physician Zhang would be severely punished
by His Majesty because of my words,

328
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,150
forgetting that times have changed

329
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,840
and I must be cautious in the palace.

330
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,790
I'm sorry.

331
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,680
Why do you need to apologize to me?

332
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,910
Remember,

333
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,540
as long as I'm around,

334
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,660
leave any dangerous matters to me.

335
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,000
Today was lucky.

336
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,670
Her Majesty's condition
was truly critical.

337
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,329
If delayed another hour or so,

338
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm afraid no medicine
could have saved her.

339
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,240
Thank you.

340
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,020
You won't let me say sorry,

341
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,480
then why did you thank me?

342
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,850
Grandmother

343
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,280
loves me dearly.

344
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,200
Today is New Year's,

345
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,920
and I saved your grandmother.

346
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,120
How will you thank me?

347
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,450
With this.

348
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,990
I wish you safety
and good health in the new year.

349
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,480
What's inscribed here?

350
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,640
"Guard Your Heart."

351
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,320
This was a token of affection
my father gave to my mother.

352
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,790
Wearing it

353
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,170
can ward off misfortune and evil,

354
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,930
and it also represents
my promise to protect you.

355
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,540
Then we can say

356
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,990
we stayed up together on New Year's Eve.

357
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,780
Do you know

358
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,680
whether the person who tried to
assassinate you back in Jingzhou

359
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,010
is in the capital or not?

360
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,390
I don't think the Crown Prince
and Prince Cheng

361
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,910
are magnanimous.

362
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,300
You need not worry about this.

363
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,740
I'll handle it myself.

364
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,000
But youâ€”

365
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,360
today you saved the Empress Dowager,

366
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,020
so you will surely become favored
by His Majesty.

367
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,630
From now on in the palace,

368
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,880
remember

369
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,830
not to get involved in the conflicts

370
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,160
between Noble Consort Su and the Empress.

371
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,690
Self-preservation comes first.

372
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,850
I never wanted to attract attention,

373
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,330
but on second thought,

374
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,260
I must get His Majesty's attention

375
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,190
so I can stay by your side.

376
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,240
If you're really worried,

377
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,000
why not give me a case to work on?

378
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,990
As a coroner,

379
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,550
those consorts and noble ladies

380
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,270
won't be paying attention to me anymore.

381
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,510
It's not just the consorts
and noble ladies;

382
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,660
those princes and young nobles

383
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,790
won't dare set their sights on you too.

384
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,070
Excellent idea.

385
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,030
I was so scared today.

386
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,220
Thankfully Grandmother
is blessed by heaven.

387
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,000
Indeed.

388
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,510
Mother, that Miss Qin's medical skills

389
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,770
are truly impressive.

390
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
How come we've never

391
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,200
heard of her before?

392
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,310
Brother, has Qin Zhaoyu ever mentioned

393
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,920
her ninth sister to you?

394
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,590
What?

395
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,570
Why are you so distracted, Brother?

396
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,920
Don't tell me

397
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,900
you've taken a fancy to Miss Qin?

398
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,750
You're not a kid anymore.

399
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,240
You must be more mindful of what you say.

400
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,320
I only act like this
in front of you, Mother.

401
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,350
Alright.

402
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,300
It's getting late.

403
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
You should go rest now,

404
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,240
There's the court assembly today.

405
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,510
You're trying to sideline me so you can
talk to Brother in private.

406
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,970
Don't think I don't know
what he's thinking.

407
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,480
He's clearly pleased

408
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,270
Miss Qin has won Father's favor

409
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,210
and also likes Zhaoyu
for her beauty and talents.

410
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,560
Stop talking nonsense.

411
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,310
What's wrong?

412
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,270
Don't tell me Zhen was right.

413
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,130
In terms of talent and abilities,

414
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,310
Lady Wan is indeed impressive.

415
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,660
It's a pity

416
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,240
that she's not from the same branch
as the Marquis of Zhongyong.

417
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,770
She won't be able to support you
in the future.

418
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Father showed her special favor today.

419
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,070
No matter how special,

420
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,890
she's still just one person.

421
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,920
The Marquis of Zhongyong
runs the Ministry of Personnel

422
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,590
and has deep roots in court.

423
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,350
If you reject his daughter for Lady Wan,

424
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,650
Noble Consort Su will immediately
arrange for Zhaoyu to marry her son.

425
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,310
Then the Marquis's full support

426
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,880
will likely go to Prince Cheng, Yan Qi.

427
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,880
Mother, please rest assured.

428
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I won't make such a foolish mistake.

429
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,930
If you really like Lady Wan,

430
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,790
why not take her
as your secondary consort?

431
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,850
Zhaoyu is virtuous and magnanimous.

432
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,330
She surely won't go against your wishes.

433
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,350
Wouldn't that be killing two birds
with one stone?

434
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,220
I've only met her once.

435
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,010
How could I like her?

436
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,750
But since you favor Zhaoyu
as the Crown Princess,

437
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,800
why haven't you given her
a definite answer?

438
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,860
The Marquis of Zhongyong
has approached me many times.

439
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,110
What comes too easily

440
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,690
won't be treasured.

441
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,050
If she really becomes the Crown Princess,

442
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,550
the Qin family might be harder to control.

443
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,310
Alright.

444
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,370
You should also go and rest now.

445
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,510
There can't be any slip-ups
in today's court assembly.

446
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,110
Don't let Prince Cheng
steal the spotlight again.

447
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,980
I see.

448
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,360
Go now.

449
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,720
If I had even a third
of Yan Chi's strategic mind,

450
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,850
I wouldn't need to do so much planning.

451
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,200
I didn't expect

452
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,430
Zhao Shuhua to be so quick.

453
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,990
Miss Qin hasn't even
arrived at the residence,

454
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,440
and the rewards have already
gone ahead of her.

455
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,400
I'd say

456
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
she's trying to win Miss Qin over
because His Majesty

457
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,400
has taken a liking to her.

458
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,240
Empress of the Nation?

459
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Even the women in brothels
aren't as good at flattering as she is.

460
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,510
Today,

461
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,690
I'll find an excuse

462
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,660
to send something to Miss Qin too,

463
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,950
just to annoy her.

464
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,160
Mother, why are you even doing all this?

465
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,110
I'm doing it for you.

466
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,680
Mother.

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,460
If you truly care about me,

468
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,270
then keep a closer eye

469
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,800
on Feng Chenbi.

470
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,310
What's wrong with Chenbi?

471
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,620
In the entire capital,

472
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,930
aside from Qin Zhaoyu,

473
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,270
who among the noble ladies

474
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,000
can even compare to her?

475
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,750
If she still wants to become
the Crown Princess,

476
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,870
she should make fewer foolish mistakes.

477
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,200
She's always coming up with petty tricks.

478
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,010
Does she really think everyone

479
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,270
in the palace is a fool?

480
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,530
She did all those things for you.

481
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,050
If you hadn't insisted
on rejecting the Duke of Zhong,

482
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,110
would she even need to fight for
the Crown Princess position?

483
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,100
Don't forget,

484
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
the Duke of Zhong is the only one
truly capable

485
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
of helping you fight for the throne.

486
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,800
And now you're turning your nose up
at Chenbi.

487
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,180
You couldn't possibly

488
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,900
have taken a fancy to that Qin Wan,
could you?

489
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,610
Let me tell you,

490
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,820
the Marquis of Zhongyong is
the Crown Prince's royal guardian.

491
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,830
He's not going to support you

492
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,230
just for a distant niece.

493
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,710
No matter how skilled Qin Wan's

494
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,800
medical abilities are,

495
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,870
she still isn't worthy of me.

496
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
There's no one in the capital who is.

497
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,140
His Majesty and the the Empress
are being far too generous.

498
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,220
Why isn't Wan here?

499
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,330
All these rewards are for her.

500
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,220
Our lady exhausted herself
saving the Empress Dowager.

501
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,480
She's still sleeping.

502
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,590
I heard from the eunuch
delivering the rewards

503
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,920
that His Majesty specifically ordered
not to wake our lady.

504
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,060
When we were in Jingzhou,

505
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,790
who would have thought that
Wan would come this far?

506
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,970
His Majesty favors Wan so much.

507
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,440
I'm afraid she's about to

508
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,640
fly high and become someone important.

509
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,130
You should get slapped

510
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,690
for talking such nonsense.

511
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,210
Lady Xiang must be possessed
by some evil spirit

512
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,540
to spout such nonsense.

513
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,430
Let her starve for a few days to calm down

514
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,550
and copy "The Virtues of Women" 100 times.

515
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,330
Only when she understands the rules

516
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,860
can she leave the quarters.

517
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,900
Xiang.

518
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,200
Mother,

519
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,240
Qin Xiang's character is twisted.

520
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,090
Perhaps...

521
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,840
we should find her a match soon.

522
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Yu is right.

523
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,180
Someone like Qin Xiang

524
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,270
will only bring trouble
to the family sooner or later.

525
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,480
We should marry her off early.

526
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Honey.

527
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,610
look.

528
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,900
None of them give me any peace.

529
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,090
Qin Xiang is like that,

530
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,930
and Qin Wanâ€¦

531
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,540
Just look at all these things.

532
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,040
They were all given by the Empress
and His Majesty to Qin Wan.

533
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,550
Qin Wan saved the Empress Dowagerâ€”

534
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,200
that's a huge merit.

535
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,400
These rewards are nothing in comparison.

536
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,780
This is a whole box of eastern pearls.

537
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,970
Even our Yu
has never received such fine things.

538
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,030
Can Yu and Qin Wan be compared?

539
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,120
Yu's status is still uncertain,

540
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,000
while Qin Wan is truly

541
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,640
the Empress Dowager's lifesaver.

542
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,030
According to etiquette,
the Empress should favor Qin Wan more.

543
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,040
Honey,

544
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,400
if the Empress changes her mind,

545
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,150
what about the marriage between
Yu and the Crown Prince?

546
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:37,720
Mother.

547
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,360
Wan gaining the favor
of the Emperor and Empress

548
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,970
is an honor to our household

549
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,590
and will also become a support for Father.

550
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,720
Yu truly understands things clearly.

551
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,600
Don't worry.

552
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,190
Qin Wan has her own destiny.

553
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,010
In any case,

554
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,010
I won't let anyone stand in the way

555
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,940
of Yu becoming the Crown Princess.

556
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,310
Gentlemen,

557
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,530
please help me place these in this room.

558
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,110
My Lady?

559
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,440
Where are you going, My Lady?

560
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,840
I'm going to diagnose the Empress Dowager.

561
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,320
After this,

562
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,350
have we finally secured our footing

563
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,550
in the Marquis Mansion and the capital?

564
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,880
Silly girl.

565
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,500
You're thinking too simply.

566
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,400
No matter how much favor I enjoy now,

567
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,210
once I start investigating
Prince Jin's case,

568
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,240
I'm afraid His Majesty

569
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,280
will be the first to want me gone.

570
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,440
Well...

571
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,650
The palace is full of
complicated relationships.

572
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,980
I won't take you with me.

573
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,880
But without anyone looking after you,

574
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,750
what if you encounter

575
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,270
some trouble in the palace?

576
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,680
Ning has been staying in the palace these days
to accompany the Empress Dowager.

577
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,790
Nothing will happen to me.

578
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,920
You must be careful too.

579
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,720
Don't let anyone into our quarters.

580
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,550
Don't worry, I won't even

581
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,550
let a fly in.

582
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,760
I'm leaving now.

583
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,790
Be careful.

584
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,600
Yu,

585
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,440
I know you've cared about
your reputation since childhood,

586
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,750
but you saw the gifts the Empress

587
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,910
sent today.

588
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,960
We have to

589
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,600
be wary of Qin Wan.

590
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,950
Mother,

591
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,110
Wan doesn't chase after wealth and status.

592
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,440
Even if Qin Wan has no intention

593
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,270
of seducing the Crown Prince,

594
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,060
what if he's just looking
for a fleeting thrill,

595
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,790
wanting to have his cake and eat it too?

596
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,850
That won't happen.

597
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,410
Your father intends to match
the Heir of Prince Rui with Qin Wan.

598
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,690
We might as well

599
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,780
push this marriage along quickly.

600
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,250
That way, we'll have fewer worries later.

601
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,330
But Yan Chi is highly favored
by His Majesty.

602
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,790
Many noble ladies
in the capital admire him.

603
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,130
But do you know
why no one has dared to form

604
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,460
a marriage alliance
with Prince Rui's household until now?

605
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,000
Because the former Princess Consort Rui

606
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,460
was poisoned to death
by Prince Rui himself.

607
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,030
Didn't Princess Consort Rui die
of massive bleeding during childbirth

608
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,690
while giving birth to Yan Chi?

609
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,750
That's just the official excuse.

610
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,090
Rumor has it that Yan Chi
wasn't Prince Rui's biological son,

611
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,320
and in a fit of rage,
Prince Rui killed his wife.

612
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,220
Keeping the child was only to save face.

613
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,400
Otherwise, why would
Prince Rui abandon his newborn son

614
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,190
and leave for Shuoxi

615
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,620
right after Princess Consort Rui's death?

616
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,060
If this ever got out,

617
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,090
how could Yan Chi inherit the title?

618
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,130
What family would dare
marry their daughter to him?

619
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,530
"Guard Your Heart."

620
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,260
This was a token of affection
my father gave to my mother.

621
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,590
Wearing it

622
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,830
can ward off misfortune and evil,

623
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,690
and it also represents
my promise to protect you.

624
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,110
Prince Rui gave this jade pendant
to the Princess Consort himself,

625
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,160
clearly showing
their deep affection for each other.

626
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,240
So how could such

627
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,400
an absurd rumor spread in the capital?

628
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,430
Prince Rui is extremely harsh
with Yan Chi.

629
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,500
If he truly believes the rumor,

630
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,500
I'm afraid he might turn on his own son,

631
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,760
and Shuoxi Army would fall apart.

632
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,260
Who could be so malicious

633
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,080
to have set up such a scheme?

634
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,270
No matter how dangerous
the road ahead may be,

635
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,110
Yan Chi,

636
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,780
it's my turn to protect you this time.

637
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,790
[Funing Palace]

638
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,180
Ma'am Chen,
Her Majesty is no longer in danger.

639
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,630
From now on, she just needs prescriptions
for treating wind symptoms.

640
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,690
That's wonderful.

641
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,930
Thank you,

642
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
Miss Qin.

643
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,890
Please, there's no need for that.

644
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,520
Ma'am, does Her Majesty
often suffer from pain in her back

645
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,040
and ringing in the ears?

646
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,920
Yes.

647
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Sometimes there's no one speaking,

648
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,310
but Her Majesty thinks someone
is talking to her.

649
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,040
When we ask,
she says she hears sounds in her ears.

650
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,170
For now,
the wind symptoms is the priority.

651
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,710
As for the ear problem,
it can be treated gradually.

652
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,320
Alright.

653
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,210
Little Wan'er,

654
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,520
Her Majesty's health
has been weakening in recent years.

655
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,390
Why don't you treat
all her conditions at once?

656
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,880
Treating illness isn't like cooking,

657
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,480
where everything needs
to be stewed together.

658
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,990
Once Her Majesty can eat,

659
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,540
I'll prepare a tonic recipe

660
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,750
to help strengthen her.

661
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,480
Don't worry.

662
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,180
She's not near the end yet.

663
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,640
With a year of care, she'll recover.

664
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,200
Okay.

665
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,970
His Majesty is here!

666
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,220
Greetings, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

667
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,760
Everyone may rise.

668
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

669
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,480
Your Majesty,

670
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,900
Her Majesty just woke up again.

671
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,330
She's able to drink some broth now.

672
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,860
Miss Qin truly lives up
to the title of the "medical fairy".

673
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,180
If I entrust you with

674
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,270
the Empress Dowager's care from now on,

675
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,200
will you accept?

676
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,400
If you trust me,

677
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,930
I will do my best.

678
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Your Majesty is quite calculating.

679
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,990
The Grand Princess

680
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,750
entrusted her adopted granddaughter
to your care.

681
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,410
You just gave her some rewards

682
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,610
and now want to use her as a physician.

683
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,440
Aren't you afraid the Grand Princess
will take her whip to you?

684
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,870
Miss Qin is

685
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,650
the Grand Princess's most treasured one.

686
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
How dare I mistreat her?

687
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,640
Miss Qin saved the Empress Dowager's life
this time,

688
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,610
and that must be recorded
as the primary merit.

689
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,050
If she can restore

690
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,630
the Empress Dowager's health,

691
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,010
that will be an even greater achievement,

692
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,270
and I will reward her handsomely.

693
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

694
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,490
Yesterday was your first time
entering the palace,

695
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,060
and you worked hard until midnight.

696
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,040
Today, there's a banquet to entertain
foreign envoys in the palace.

697
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,830
You should sit with Zhen and Ning.

698
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,310
Now, I'll go see the Empress Dowager.

699
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,740
Miss Qin, don't worry about
formal dresses and protocol.

700
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,020
Zhen has a few dresses she hasn't worn.

701
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,830
You two are similar in size.

702
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,090
With some adjustments, they'll fit you.

703
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

704
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,690
Little Wan'er, this is wonderful.

705
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,070
Today's palace banquet will feature martial contests
among warriors from various countries.

706
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,470
It's much more entertaining
than the New Year's Eve banquet.

707
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,030
I heard that.

708
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,270
Ning, if you keep talking nonsense,

709
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,000
I'll have you sent back to Jingzhou.

710
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,190
I won't dare, Uncle.

711
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,489
Royal Guardian.

712
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,480
Little Wan'er, just you wait.

713
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,199
Today will definitely be fun.

714
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,500
I really envy Lady Wan.

715
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,250
It's only her second time at the palace,

716
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,730
yet she's already sitting
at the same table as the princesses.

717
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,600
Miss Qin saved my grandmother.

718
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,330
She deserves the honor Father gave her.

719
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,540
These people's faces sure change fast.

720
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,700
In just one night,

721
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,720
they've all become so attentive to you.

722
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,040
They must have forgotten how they

723
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,800
treated you like poison yesterday.

724
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,440
I don't care what they say.

725
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,490
I'm just here to enjoy the food and drink.

726
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,530
Why hasn't Chi arrived yet?

727
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,660
He wouldn't be off hanging out

728
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,190
with Yan Li again, would he?

729
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,880
This Yan Liâ€”

730
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,920
he didn't come on New Year's Eve,
which was fine,

731
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,880
but he won't show up
on New Year's Day either.

732
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,750
Without him,

733
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,440
the palace banquet food
just isn't as good.

734
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,370
What are you looking at?

735
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,510
Why isn't he coming over?

736
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,070
Don't push him.

737
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,440
He's just like Yan Chiâ€”

738
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,550
despite all their honors,

739
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,970
life in the capital
is still tough for them.

740
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,660
Little Wan'er,

741
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,230
why do I feel

742
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,630
you're rather sympathetic
toward those two?

743
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,430
The longer I live in the capital,

744
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,960
the more I understand their difficulties.

745
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,030
You have a point.

746
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,470
But

747
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,630
being stuck in the palace every day

748
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,110
isn't easy for me either.

749
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,880
You should pity me too.

750
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,440
Yes.

751
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,030
I should feel sorry for you.

752
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm sorry that you can't run around

753
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,430
drinking and racing horses
with Yan Li all day,

754
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,360
and instead have to pretend to be obedient here
â€”it must be exhausting.

755
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,480
His Majesty is here!

756
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,330
On this auspicious New Year's Day,

757
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,040
we celebrate with great joy.

758
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,200
We wish Your Majesty
longevity and eternal prosperity.

759
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,050
I wish to share the good fortune
of the New Year

760
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,780
with all of you.

761
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,290
[Yuan Hong, Crown Prince of Beidai]

762
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,640
[Liu Bin, Prince of Xihan]

763
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,630
We pay our respects to Your Majesty.

764
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,820
Please rise.

765
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,560
Guests from afar,

766
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,430
please take your seats.

767
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

768
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,560
Before the New Year,
heavy snow blocked the roads in the north.

769
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
I thought we would have to wait

770
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,030
until spring to meet,

771
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,740
but unexpectedly,

772
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,660
we have this chance
to gather on New Year's Day.

773
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,800
Come,

774
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,610
everyone, raise your cups together.

775
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,660
Let us drink this New Year's wine

776
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,320
and wish for peace among the people

777
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
and abundance throughout the land!

778
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,950
Peace for the people

779
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,040
and abundance for the land!

780
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,920
Your Majesty,

781
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,760
I've long heard that

782
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,140
Beidai and Xihan
produce exceptional talents.

783
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,540
Seeing them today,

784
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,410
they truly are outstanding.

785
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,190
Especially Princess Yuanwu,

786
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,630
whose beauty

787
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,210
outshines even our Zhen.

788
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,570
Though Princess Yuanwu is beautiful,

789
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,150
Mother, your praise in front of everyone

790
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,840
embarrasses me.

791
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,240
Your Highness, you flatter us.

792
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,000
Princess Zhen is lively and charming,

793
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,280
with unparalleled grace.

794
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,000
How can my sister
compare to Princess Zhen?

795
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,220
Though my brother's
not very good with words,

796
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,300
he has prepared a gift
for Her Highness the Princess.

797
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,420
[Yuan Rui, Prince of Beidai]
[Yuan Wu, Princess of Beidai]

798
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,510
What a coincidence.

799
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,400
I have also prepared a gift

800
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,450
for Her Highness.

801
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,920
Why don't we all present our gifts

802
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,420
and let the Princess decide

803
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,540
which she prefers?

804
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,820
What do you say?

805
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,470
How thoughtful of you both.

806
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,340
Let's take advantage
of Princess Zhen's presence

807
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,520
to see the treasures.

808
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,320
Everyone, please look.

809
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,110
This gem is hidden deep

810
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,040
in our Beidai's Cangyu Mountains.

811
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,620
Its color is as fiery red as flame,

812
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,090
shining brighter than the sun and moon.

813
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,350
It is truly the finest pigeon blood ruby.

814
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,230
I believe only such a unique treasure

815
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,680
is worthy of the noble Princess Zhen
of your esteemed country.

816
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,820
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

817
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,110
finding such a rare ruby

818
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,550
truly shows your sincerity.

819
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,990
Your Majesty, if I may.

820
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,110
this little snow fox
is highly intelligent.

821
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,220
Princess,

822
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,920
you only need to wear this taming bell
for three days,

823
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,000
and the little snow fox will regard you

824
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,410
as its one and only master

825
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,960
and will never harm you.

826
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,460
Your Highness,

827
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,600
please try it on.

828
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,190
Father, Mother,

829
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,470
I want this little fox.

830
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,150
Very well.

831
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,800
Since you like it,

832
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,420
you shall be this fox's master.

833
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,940
Thank you, Father.

834
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,920
Good neighborliness brings
lasting happiness for generations.

835
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,170
I heard that the Beidai Crown Prince

836
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,550
and the Third Prince of Xihan

837
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,330
are both outstanding
in both literature and martial arts.

838
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,840
You have traveled far.

839
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,080
Please rest well first.

840
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,210
Ten days from now,

841
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,550
we will hold an archery contest
at the Southern Court.

842
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,240
I specially appointed Yan Chi,
the Heir of Prince Rui,

843
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,010
to accompany you in the competition.

844
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,150
Here,

845
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,190
I wish you success in taking first place.

846
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,430
Your Majesty,

847
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,450
if I win the archery contest in ten days,

848
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,450
will there be a reward for me as well?

849
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,760
Of course.

850
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,310
Your Majesty,

851
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,560
if I win, I don't want anything elseâ€”

852
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,750
I only want

853
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,920
Young Commander Yan as my consort.
