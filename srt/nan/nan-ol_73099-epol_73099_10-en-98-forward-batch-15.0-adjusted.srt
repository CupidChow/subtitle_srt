[Episode 10]

3
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,070
Yue.

4
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,070
It's you.

5
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,570
Heavenly Lord.

6
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,610
Are you alright?

7
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,620
Long Yuan.

8
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,370
Wait!

9
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,720
What are you going to do now?

10
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,360
Your spiritual energy…

11
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,710
I've been sealed for centuries.

12
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,590
You think it's easy
to fight against you guys?

13
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,530
You're throwing your life away.

14
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,360
If it means sparing me from
the monthly torment of the evil energy,

15
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,030
I'd risk everything.

16
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,150
Li Mo, aren't you going to act?

17
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,180
If you hadn't been soft-hearted
and refused to kill her back then,

18
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,040
we wouldn't be in this mess now.

19
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,540
No need to do anything.

20
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Her spiritual energy is exhausted.

21
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,710
She's no threat anymore.

22
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,140
I've heard too many men say they love me.

23
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,390
But it turned out…

24
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,040
they all lied.

25
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,430
Living is just suffering for me.

26
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,720
The only thing I've ever truly wanted

27
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,780
was to see you again

28
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,680
and hear you say

29
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,310
you love me.

30
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,120
I've done the first.

31
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,050
As for the second…

32
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,580
it doesn't matter anymore.

33
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,900
Kill me.

34
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,750
I'm done living with
the torment of the evil energy!

35
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,900
She's your destined tribulation.

36
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,510
No matter what you do,
you can't escape it.

37
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,920
You say you study healing arts,

38
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,900
that you were born to help others,

39
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,480
but you couldn't even save me.

40
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,470
How can you save anyone else?

41
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,270
There are countless forms
of love in this world,

42
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,750
not just romantic love.

43
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,480
So,

44
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,170
this is truly my tribulation.

45
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,720
I told you, I'll free you

46
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,430
from the evil energy.

47
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,310
How did you do that?

48
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,120
I love you.

49
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
But not the way lovers do.

50
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,450
Mine is the kind of love
that seeks to save all beings.

51
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Think carefully.

52
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
Not all the men you met

53
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,030
were pretending to care.

54
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,530
So… you're saying yes?

55
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,670
They truly cared for you.

56
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,830
Wonderful!

57
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,490
The one who pretended to care…

58
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,680
Honglian.

59
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,360
Was you.

60
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,800
I've come back to marry you.

61
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
You only wanted
to dispel the evil energy.

62
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,730
You never truly cared for them.

63
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,050
That's why their heart blood

64
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,680
couldn't dispel your evil energy.

65
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,770
The root of it lies in you,

66
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,630
not in them.

67
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,010
So,

68
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,810
it's not about being loved.

69
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,270
It's about learning to love.

70
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,530
Exactly.

71
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,740
As long as you have love in your heart,

72
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,360
no evil spirits or energy can touch you.

73
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,120
Actually, I should thank you.

74
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,770
You helped me understand my tribulation.

75
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,000
In the past, I only cared about
saving the world and helping others,

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
but I never truly understood

77
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,610
what it meant to help someone.

78
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,140
It means to feel their pain

79
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
so you can ease their suffering.

80
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,270
I see.

81
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,190
I see.

82
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,080
Now

83
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,300
I finally understand
what you meant by "sin."

84
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,150
I've heard
there's a Jade Pool in Empyrean.

85
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,630
Please, take me there

86
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,070
so I may begin cultivation anew.

87
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,510
I won't need long to regain my form.

88
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,260
This time, I won't go astray again.

89
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,670
Alright, I promise you.

90
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,640
Are you really okay?

91
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,360
Have you forgotten what I practice?

92
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,290
These minor injuries are nothing.

93
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,840
Good. Then let's get down to business.

94
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,150
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

95
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:25,240
In the tranquil mountains, the Way
guides those destined to follow it.

96
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,960
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

97
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,150
In the tranquil mountains, the Way
guides those destined to follow it.

98
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,080
Young man, are you getting on the boat?

99
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,510
Yes.

100
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,720
May I ask how much you charge?

101
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,720
I ferry people for pleasure alone.

102
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,670
I don't want
spiritual pills or magical tools.

103
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,600
I only ferry those destined to meet me.

104
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,740
In that case, I'll trouble you.

105
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,690
Come, get on the boat.

106
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,870
Hold on tight.

107
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,440
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

108
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Young man.

109
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,020
I sense the yin and yang
in your body are in conflict.

110
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,770
Did you use the demon clan's
sacred object, the Sky-Reaching Ladder?

111
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,910
I did.

112
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,870
Do you understand
how dangerous that thing is?

113
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,240
I do.

114
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,030
And yet you dared
to come to the Nine Heavens

115
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,920
as a mortal?

116
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,150
From what I can see, you don't seem like
the type to do whatever it takes

117
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,770
just to become immortal.

118
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,480
So, what is it you seek

119
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,410
in the Nine Heavens?

120
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,210
I'm looking for someone I knew.

121
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,570
The Nine Heavens are vast and boundless.

122
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,790
There are countless
immortals and cultivators here.

123
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,990
Do you know where the person
you're looking for resides?

124
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,850
Canglei Palace, Danxia Land.

125
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,960
Canglei Palace?

126
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,550
Yes.

127
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,600
That place
belongs to Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

128
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,730
You've heard of it?

129
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,440
Who hasn't heard of Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

130
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,960
Come on, sit down.

131
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,790
Heavenly Lord Dacheng has powerful magic.

132
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,290
In the Nine Heavens,

133
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,440
he's one of the most powerful immortals.

134
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,200
If he was really that powerful,

135
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,460
he'd have ascended to Empyrean long ago.

136
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,240
Why is he still here?

137
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,870
Sounds like

138
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,320
you've got a bone to pick
with Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

139
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You're not here in the Danxia Land

140
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,030
to cause him trouble, are you?

141
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,170
If I say I am,

142
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,490
will you believe me?

143
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,110
Fate and karma

144
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,390
are beyond my comprehension.

145
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,950
Hold on tight.

146
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,600
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

147
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,270
In the tranquil mountains, the Way
guides those destined to follow it.

148
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,850
Immortal Lord Li Mo.

149
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,950
Is this Immortal Lord Long Yuan?

150
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,850
What are you doing?

151
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,570
Heavenly Lord, Immortal Lord Li Mo.

152
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,800
Say something.

153
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,300
Long time no see,

154
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,630
Siling.

155
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,630
How dare you show yourself
around Master again?

156
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,120
You...

157
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,080
You've got the wrong person.

158
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,150
I'm Li Qingyue,

159
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,250
not Siling.

160
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,270
I saw you use the Blazing Fire just now.

161
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,080
That was the magic once used

162
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,540
by Divine Lord Siling.

163
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,890
I... I don't know why.

164
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,030
It… it just happened
in the heat of the moment…

165
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,320
Siling and Master are of the same origin.

166
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,350
When one falls, the other rises.

167
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,870
Master is severely injured,

168
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,720
and you've gained new power.

169
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,350
Can you explain that?

170
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,790
We were pulled into the Vortex of Stars

171
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,670
and ended up in the Land of Ruins.

172
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
From here on, you have to travel alone.

173
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,720
I ended up here by chance.
If any immortal resides here,

174
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,380
could you give me directions?

175
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,610
Is anyone here?

176
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,790
You work for the Heavenly Lord?

177
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,650
Heavenly Lord?

178
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,190
You mean Heavenly Lord Dacheng, Bai Jiusi?

179
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,050
So you're not with him.

180
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,580
Who are you?

181
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,730
Give it back!

182
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,070
This is yours?

183
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,280
Give it to me!

184
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,870
Who exactly are you?

185
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,310
Jingyun Sect's

186
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,100
Zhang Suan.

187
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,070
Zhang Suan?

188
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
You're Li Qingyue's senior?

189
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,750
Oh no.

190
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,650
Why are you following me?

191
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,670
You still have my pendant.

192
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,580
Give it back.

193
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,990
Where did you get that?

194
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,570
A family heirloom?

195
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,380
You seem very interested in it.

196
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,150
You mentioned Qingyue just now.

197
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,080
You know her?

198
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,730
Where is she?

199
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,130
Why are you looking for her?

200
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,530
She's in danger.

201
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,160
Master, your old injury
has affected your heart meridian.

202
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,420
Now with your spiritual energy drained,

203
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,760
a full recovery will be very difficult.

204
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,030
I've searched through
ancient texts and found a possible method

205
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,970
that might help.

206
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,590
But the required ingredients
are extremely rare.

207
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,590
What do you need?

208
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,670
Use snake slough as the base,

209
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,510
and combine it with aconite, monkshood,
cinnamon twig, and asarum.

210
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,800
Refine it with
the Chaos Fire for 49 days and nights.

211
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,350
Most of those ingredients
can be found in Danxia Land.

212
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,000
There's still a wisp
of the Chaos Fire left in Empyrean.

213
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,830
Immortal Lord Long Yuan
can go and borrow it.

214
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,430
That shouldn't be a problem.

215
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,110
The Chaos Fire is easy to obtain.

216
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,790
But getting the snake slough
is the real challenge.

217
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,510
Ordinary snake slough

218
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,910
won't do anything for Master's condition.

219
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,770
It must be from a flying snake.

220
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,970
And it should be the skin

221
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,330
it sheds at the moment of transformation.

222
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,630
Flying snake?

223
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,270
Humans have primordial spirits;
beasts have golden cores.

224
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,800
But a flying snake
is neither human nor beast.

225
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,240
With a primordial spirit in its head,

226
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,080
it's a born divine being.

227
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,750
As the primordial spirit
in its head grows stronger,

228
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,790
when the time is right,
heavenly lightning will strike,

229
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,110
shattering its shell
and freeing it from the physical body.

230
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,920
At that moment,

231
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,920
its primordial spirit
will be released from its head.

232
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,160
The snake will shed its skin and gain
wings, becoming a true flying snake.

233
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,750
And what if it hasn't transformed yet?

234
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,070
A flying snake that hasn't transformed

235
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,470
looks no different from an ordinary snake.

236
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,960
Its slough is also no different.

237
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,440
Why didn't you mention any of this before?

238
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,830
Because you'd never
been injured to the extent of…

239
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,750
From what I've found,

240
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,780
Siling's old mount, the White Snake,

241
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,680
has indeed perished.

242
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,800
And its primordial spirit?

243
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,420
That remains unknown.

244
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
How is she now?

245
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Her Ladyship…

246
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,590
Li Qingyue

247
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,520
was taken by Immortal Lord Long Yuan
to the dungeon in the mountain.

248
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,310
While you were severely injured,

249
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,440
he temporarily took over everything.

250
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,050
You're still injured!

251
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,970
Pass through this formation,

252
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,560
and you can leave the Ruins.

253
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,210
Alright.

254
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,610
You're not coming?

255
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,530
Since you know the way out,

256
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,840
why are you still trapped here?

257
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,550
I have my reasons for staying.

258
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,090
You just need to focus on your own path.

259
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,810
Don't ask about anything else.

260
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,510
Sorry.

261
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,070
Wait.

262
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,090
Head east.

263
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,960
Ride the wind for 1,000 miles,

264
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,560
and you'll reach the place
you're looking for.

265
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,870
Thank you.

266
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,040
You're welcome.

267
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,920
Zhang Suan?

268
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,050
[Xiao Jingshan]

269
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,270
So this is my fate.

270
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,300
So be it.

271
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,200
So be it.

272
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,450
I've hated birds my whole life.

273
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,750
Guess luck

274
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,690
just wasn't on your side today.

275
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,340
Who's there? Tell me your name.

276
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,170
As a human cultivator,

277
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
you dared to come to the Nine Heavens

278
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,100
but don't have the guts to meet me?

279
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,160
Boy.

280
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,750
Got any wine?

281
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,200
Brat, you actually tried
to fool me with water.

282
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,370
Don't leave yet.

283
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,920
Throw that dead bird somewhere far away.

284
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,310
You killed it?

285
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,030
So what if I did?

286
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,000
You killed it

287
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,720
but don't have the guts
to dispose of its body?

288
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,380
Just do as I say.

289
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,970
Spare me the lectures!

290
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,600
You… are hurt?

291
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,830
Nonsense.

292
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,150
Who could possibly hurt me?

293
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,770
You're severely injured.

294
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm not injured.

295
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,790
Your spiritual platform is shattered,
and your power is fading.

296
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,270
You call that "not injured"?

297
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,800
You ask too many questions.

298
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,830
Get lost.

299
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,670
Someone just told me

300
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,790
if I ride the wind eastward
for 1,000 miles,

301
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,320
I'll reach Canglei Palace.

302
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,830
But I've flown for ages and seen nothing.

303
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,460
You've been
in the Nine Heavens for so long.

304
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,030
Do you know where Canglei Palace is?

305
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,310
That's Bai Jiusi's residence.

306
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,360
Why are you going there?

307
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,890
To find someone.

308
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
You mean Bai Jiusi?

309
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,440
I know a thing or two
about Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

310
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,070
He's an arrogant man—

311
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,830
temperamental

312
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,750
and ruthless.

313
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,440
You're just a lowly human cultivator.

314
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,790
Aren't you afraid
he'll kill you with a single strike?

315
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,220
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

316
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,030
Three, two, one.

317
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,240
Drop.

318
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,750
Brat.

319
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,270
You want to get out of here?

320
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,510
I can help you.

321
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,830
But you must promise me one thing.

322
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,620
Are you here to save me?

323
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,150
Do you also believe
I'm Divine Lord Siling?

324
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,060
When did you and Honglian
start plotting together?

325
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,680
In the illusion?

326
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,370
At Lanyue House?

327
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,440
Or had it all been arranged

328
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,170
when you were in the Hell Ruins?

329
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,350
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

330
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,950
I've played along with you
for long enough.

331
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,310
When are you going to stop pretending?

332
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,240
I'm not pretending.

333
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,500
Your power and mine shift in opposition.

334
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,350
I lost my fire magic
after the battle with Honglian.

335
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,410
But you became better
at controlling the Blazing Fire.

336
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,860
Clearly, you had joined forces with her.

337
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,570
You lured Li Mo out for her,

338
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,560
and she helped you wound me badly

339
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,360
so you could reclaim your power.

340
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,790
You say you're not Divine Lord Siling.

341
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,880
Then tell me—

342
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,360
where did you learn
to control fire like that?

343
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,420
Speak!

344
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,100
So when you called Yue,

345
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,720
you were never calling me.

346
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,550
I don't know how

347
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,110
I suddenly learned
the Fire-Parting Technique.

348
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,850
All I know is,
when I saw you frozen in ice,

349
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,220
there was only one thought in my mind—

350
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,980
to save you, no matter the cost.

351
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,560
I just didn't expect…

352
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,320
I didn't expect that in the end,

353
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,820
it would become my crime.

354
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,860
Heavenly Lord,

355
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,400
I wanted to save you.

356
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,890
Was that wrong?

357
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,590
So you've made up your mind

358
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,270
not to tell me the truth, huh?

359
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,090
If you've already
judged me guilty in your heart,

360
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,210
why bother questioning me at all?

361
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,260
For both of us,

362
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,470
it's just a waste of time.

363
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,270
A waste of time?

364
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,030
Indeed.

365
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,440
Tolerating you for so long

366
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,170
has indeed been a waste of time.

367
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,450
Yue, your magic and mine
counterbalance each other.

368
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,310
When one wanes, the other grows.

369
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,960
If one of us is badly wounded,

370
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,550
the other's magic surges.

371
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,890
I'll ask you one last time.

372
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,840
What exactly are you planning?

373
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,620
Confess,

374
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,920
and I'll stop.

375
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,750
Before I answer,

376
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,000
can you answer something for me first?

377
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,790
Go ahead.

378
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,720
All the kindness you showed me before—

379
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
was it because of me

380
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,800
or because of Yue?

381
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Listen carefully.

382
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,240
My name is Li Qingyue.

383
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,800
I used to live
at the foot of Yufan Mountain.

384
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,100
My father's surname is Li,
and my mother's is Jiang.

385
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,270
I joined the Jingyun Sect
at the age of eight

386
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,130
and guarded the gate for 11 years.

387
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,720
At 19, I married into Canglei Palace

388
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,880
and became the wife
of Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

389
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,680
I have my own friends in the sect.

390
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,920
I have my own joys and sorrows.

391
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,570
I have my own life!

392
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,630
I am Li Qingyue.

393
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,240
Always,

394
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,350
just Li Qingyue.

395
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,480
You're still lying.

396
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,720
Must I verify it myself?

397
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,120
How dare I trouble
the Heavenly Lord to verify it personally?

398
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,610
You just want me to get hurt, right?

399
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,430
I'll do it myself.

Master.

415
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,800
Li Mo said you're badly injured.

416
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,880
This place is cold and damp.

417
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,660
You really didn't need to come in person.

418
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Let me handle such trivial matters.

419
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,400
My Lord, has Her Ladyship
done anything wrong?

420
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,840
She's just recovered from a serious
illness. Her foundation is not yet stable.

421
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,960
The dungeon is cold and damp. Please…

422
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
Master, what's wrong?

423
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,190
Send her back to Yuewu House.

424
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,060
Thank you, My Lord.

425
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,940
-Let go of me!
-Don't move.

426
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,530
What are you doing?

427
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,760
Boy, fortune has smiled upon you.

428
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,840
From this moment on,

429
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,170
every word I say—

430
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,890
you must remember it by heart.

431
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,540
My name is Xiao Jingshan.

432
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,670
I'm from Nanwu in Ning.

433
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,150
My parents and brothers
were all ordinary folk.

434
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,030
At the age of 21,
I got married and had a son.

435
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,510
Unfortunately, I fell victim
to some scumbags.

436
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,510
My family was destroyed overnight.

437
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,960
So I started cultivation,

438
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,440
expecting to avenge their deaths one day.

439
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,230
But my fellow disciples were arrogant,

440
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,960
kept making things hard for me.

441
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,690
By my fourth year,
they expelled me from the sect.

442
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,500
From then on, I trained alone.

443
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,360
I drew power from nature
and learned wisdom from life.

444
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,590
I gave up on the Way to find the Way
and saw truth through illusions.

445
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,520
Abandoning the righteous path,
I gained true power.

446
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,280
Why are you telling me all this?

447
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,480
You are to become my disciple.

448
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,440
Of course I must tell you my story.

449
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,840
Who said I want to be your disciple?

450
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,400
I…

451
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,150
Too noisy.

452
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,320
Life is like a dream,

453
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,360
a dream hard to wake from.

454
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,820
I'm nearing the end of my life.

455
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,960
Yet a disciple showed up out of nowhere.

456
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,130
It seems the heavens haven't forsaken me.

457
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,510
Time is short.

458
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,320
Let's hurry up.

459
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,670
First, kowtow to me.

460
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,980
Good, good.

461
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,920
Enough.

462
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,510
I'm at death's door.

463
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,000
These past few days, I've mastered
an extremely profound sword technique.

464
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,230
I've decided to pass it on to you.

465
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,960
Once your power has greatly increased,

466
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,360
you can leave Taiyi Peak.

467
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,480
Boy, I'll only demonstrate this once.

468
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,490
Watch carefully.

469
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,230
Qi gathers in the upper dantian;

470
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,190
spirit spring flows to qihai;

471
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,740
purple flame settles at shenque;

472
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,610
the sword bridges yin and yang.

473
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,870
Boy, did you see it clearly?

474
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,230
This sword technique is exquisite.

475
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
What's it called?

476
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,360
I haven't decided yet.

477
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,670
Do you have any enemies?

478
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,240
There is one person.

479
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,280
I suppose you could call him that.

480
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,880
Who?

481
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,630
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, Bai Jiusi.

482
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,480
Good!

483
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,020
Then let's call it
the Immortal-Slaying Sword Technique.

484
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,630
Stop yelling, brat!

485
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,010
I'm passing my life's cultivation to you.

486
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,870
You've hit the jackpot!

487
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,420
My Lord, I need to tell you something.

488
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,800
Even though you've permitted it,

489
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,460
Immortal Lord Long Yuan
refuses to release her.

490
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,590
As of now, Her Ladyship

491
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,450
is still locked up in the dungeon.

492
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,230
Go and release her.

493
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,760
Yes.

494
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,410
Don't do that!

495
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,560
Go out.
I have something to report to Master.

496
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,250
You have no right to stay here.

497
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,150
What happened?

498
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,540
I heard from Li Mo about the flying snake,

499
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,690
so I used
the Spirit-Seeking Spell to look for it.

500
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,390
The White Snake is not in Hell.

501
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,290
Either it has perished
from the Three Realms,

502
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,400
or it simply didn't die.

503
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,040
Between the two,

504
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I'm inclined to believe the latter.

505
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,400
Master, Li Qingyue conjured
the Blazing Fire that day.

506
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,060
We all saw it with our own eyes.

507
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,360
There's no way we could be mistaken.

508
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,820
Siling harmed you
more than once in the past.

509
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,320
Now that she has reappeared,

510
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,450
she definitely has ulterior motives.

511
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,360
Master, you mustn't go soft again.
