4
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,760
Everyone!

5
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,820
Back to the mountain manor now!

6
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,060
Mother, activate the mechanism!

7
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,990
Leave this to me.

8
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay.

9
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,260
Hurry!

10
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,630
Everyone! Attack!

11
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,520
You didn't expect a magnetic arrow

12
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,980
could turn your Xianri Sedan

13
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,770
into a pile of scrap iron, did you?

14
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,970
You stole the Cloud-chasing Carriage from Tianji Hall

15
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,920
and turned it into a killing weapon.

16
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,050
Did you think I couldn't find its core?

17
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,520
Since I came back from Shishou Village,

18
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,920
I've been studying this.

19
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,870
What other moves do you have now?

20
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,460
Good.

21
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,930
My son, Tianji Hall has really taught you well.

Xiaofeng!

26
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,250
Director Di.

27
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,810
You're late.

28
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,800
What do you want?

29
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,680
If you want her to live,

30
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,820
give me the Rama Heavenly Ice.

31
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,800
Your memory has been recovered?

32
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,550
You traitor!

33
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,050
You ungrateful man.

34
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,150
You've colluded with the Wansheng Clan.

35
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,620
We just work together for what we each want.

36
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
Give it to me.

37
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,170
I don't have much patience.

38
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,630
You won't get what you want

39
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,800
by getting blood from a stone.

40
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,860
Cut it out.

41
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,620
Xiaofeng!

42
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,430
Aunt!

43
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,870
Shan Gudao!

44
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,290
If you want to achieve great things,

45
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,810
don't care about trifles.

46
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,340
Hand it over.

47
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,210
Fang Xiaobao.

48
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,910
Give him the Heavenly Ice.

49
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,030
Where's the other piece?

50
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,530
Aunt!

51
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,610
If I give it to you,

52
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,130
you must release her at the same time.

53
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,280
My son.

54
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,810
It seems that Tianji Hall didn't teach you well.

55
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,870
You want to bargain with your father?

56
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,159
You're not qualified to bargain with me.

57
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,680
Xiaofeng!

58
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,240
Aunt!

59
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,540
Hand it over!

60
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,220
Xiaofeng.

61
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,310
Are you okay?

62
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,950
Thank you for your help, Director Di.

63
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,930
As long as I have you, Director Di, by my side,

64
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,570
everything's much easier.

65
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,020
Senior.

66
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,770
This is the last time I'm calling you this.

67
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,290
In the past,

68
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,720
I've never fought with you for anything.

69
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,860
In the future,

70
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll take your life

71
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,010
and return it to Master.

72
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,770
Let's see if you are lucky enough

73
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,620
to live to that day.

74
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,280
Finally.

75
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,420
I finally got all four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice

76
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,180
in my own hands.

77
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,220
Burn your body.

78
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,030
Exorcise your soul.

79
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,940
Sacrifice Sui and Yan for fire.

80
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,830
Karmic fire burns the sky!

81
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,560
Congratulations, Master.

82
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,090
Congratulations, Master.

83
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,630
Once I open the Rama Vessel,

84
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,820
everything in the world

85
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,430
will be mine.

86
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,860
Di Feisheng.

87
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,520
What are you doing?

88
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,200
I've helped you get it done.

89
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,020
As for this...

90
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,310
I'll take it.

91
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,890
Di Feisheng.

92
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,080
Don't be so crazy.

93
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,640
This is the Wansheng Clan.

94
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,720
This isn't somewhere you can

95
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,180
come and leave as you wish.

96
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,960
So the ranking of martial skills

97
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,490
in Who's Who of Martial Arts can't be trusted.

98
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,490
Director Di, you're right.

99
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,680
You two also did a good job.

100
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,720
In the whole martial world,

101
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,280
how many masters of martial arts

102
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,550
can beat you,

103
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,750
Director Di?

104
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,700
So I'd very much like

105
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,360
to work with you, Director Di.

106
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,330
If you really need it for emergencies,

107
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
I can lend you

108
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,310
the Rama Vessel and Rama Heavenly Ice, Director Di.

109
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,250
There's one more thing.

110
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,430
I heard that you sent people to investigate

111
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,050
the whereabouts of the Styx Flower, Director Di.

112
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,360
What a coincidence.

113
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,940
I happen to have the Styx Flower.

114
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,040
I think you must be very interested, Director Di.

115
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,370
Are you serious?

116
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,490
These leaves are the leaves of the Styx Flower.

117
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,340
You can ask the Medicine Demon to identify them.

118
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,990
As long as

119
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,390
you return the two things to me

120
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,230
as soon as possible after you are done with them, Director Di,

121
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,990
I'll gift the Styx Flower to you.

122
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
What do you think?

123
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
It's not a bad idea.

124
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,220
Keep the Styx Flower well,

125
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,610
and wait for me.

126
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,220
So I'm still the one who knows

127
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,900
the best way to handle my man.

128
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,070
How's that?

129
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,610
I told you about the Styx Flower.

130
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,420
It really worked, right?

131
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,780
My efforts of sending people to search everywhere

132
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,370
and getting the Styx Flower

133
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,600
into my hands one step ahead paid off.

134
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,620
Sect Leader Shan.

135
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,240
I've let bygones be bygones and worked with you again.

136
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,700
You should know

137
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,620
what I want.

138
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,250
Rest assured.

139
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,130
After I make the best of Di Feisheng,

140
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,230
he'll be yours.

141
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,220
Rest assured?

142
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,240
I still remember vividly what happened before.

143
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,530
Last time, it was just a stopgap.

144
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,880
You saw it yourself, too.

145
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,370
Di Feisheng was pressing me,

146
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,030
so I had to pretend to obey him.

147
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,450
If both of us fall out with him,

148
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,060
it will be bad for Nanyin's cause.

149
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,200
I think

150
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,570
we should keep the sharp knife for now.

151
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,370
You don't have to

152
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,730
make kicking off the ladder sound so nice, Sect Leader Shan.

153
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,900
If I hadn't sent the message

154
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,630
and asked Snow Master to save you,

155
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,870
who would know where you were locked up?

156
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,120
Moreover,

157
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,800
we are from the same clan.

158
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,020
We are both descendants of the royal family of Nanyin.

159
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
We should be even more united.

160

[Ninglan Hall]

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,620
Saintess.

162
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,140
Are you really working with Shan Gudao again this time?

163
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,130
I, Jiao Liqiao,

164
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,470
am not someone who'd suffer in silence.

165
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,380
I just want to take down Di Feisheng

166
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,920
with his help.

167
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,210
Di Feisheng.

168
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,750
After this is done,

169
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,300
I'll definitely

170
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,290
get even with him.

171
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,810
Your martial skills have improved a lot lately, Kid.

172
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,650
When did you do that?

173
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,580
Just now.

174
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,580
When I slapped back

175
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,780
the waves you set off.

176
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,300
How's that, Master?

177
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,260
This time I passed the test, right?

178
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,730
Fine.

179
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,760
Go down the mountain with your senior.

180
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,870
Thank you, Master.

181
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,610
I'll make sure to use the sword in my hand

182
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,130
to help the weak and suppress the overpowering,

184
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,070
and bring glory to our sect.

185
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,990
I don't want you to be a big shot.

186
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,980
I just want you and your senior

187
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,520

When you come back,

191
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,940
bring me a new flask,

192
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,400
and fill it with fine wine.

193

Master.

194
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,710
I've fixed the wine gourd for you.

195
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,300
I promised to have a drink with you,

196
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
but there's no such chance anymore.

197

should come to an end.

199

You knew you are injured,

200
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,140
yet you forcibly used your inner power so many times just now.

201
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,540
Do you really want to die?

202
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,730
Just minor injuries.

203
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,860
It's okay.

204
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,270
It's okay?

205
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,330
When we were on Yunyin Mountain,

206
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,350
you told me the poison had been detoxicated.

207
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,010
I actually believed it.

208
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,260
You are blaming everything

209
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,320
on yourself again.

210
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,940
I said it's not your fault.

211
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,060
The cause of it is that I didn't see through or doubt the people who work for me.

212
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
So, it is my fault.

213
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,700
If you want to forget your identity as Li Xiangyi,

214
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,200
you should face your present self truthfully.

215
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
Why are you still holding onto the past?

216

It's been too long since I let go of the past.

Li Lianhua has lived a carefree life for ten years.

For what to end?

220

From back when we were on Yunyin Mountain to now,

221
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,540
I'm afraid the poison in your body

222
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,400
has already...

223
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,260
I'm afraid there's less than a month left.

There must be a way to save you.

I must go with you.

You also have to promise me that

you won't use your inner power anymore.

It's hard not to doubt that you have other thoughts.

Is it wrong to agree readily?

So where are you going now?

To find out what Di Feisheng is really up to.

259

I don't think he would have worked

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,360
with Shan Gudao for no reason.

261

If we can find him,

maybe there's still a chance for us to get the Heavenly Ice.

Do you have any clue?

of Di Feisheng ten years ago.

266
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,900
He's from a hidden place in the southwest

specially built for Death Sorcerer training.

268

when he just lost his memory?

270

Why?

274
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,220
So you suspect the reason why Di Feisheng did this

275
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,480
has something to do with his background?

276

Di Feisheng

00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,980
has been famous in the martial world for so many years,

278

but he never mentioned his background.

So it's really the similar mind control techniques.

00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,210
Shan Gudao wants to threaten me with the Styx Flower.

343
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,000
Now I have both the flower and the Rama Vessel.

344
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,600
Let's see what else he can do.

345
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,900
Go find Li Lianhua.

346
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,470
My Lord.

347
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,900
Guess

348
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,170
whether you can leave or not?

349
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,220
Jiao Liqiao.

350
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,400
What's wrong?

351
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,960
Stay away!

352
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,600
The Styx Flower is not poisonous.

353
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,520
That's because I put the poison

354
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,460
on him, King Xunming of Yama.

355
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,000
Otherwise, how could I have fooled you, My Lord?

356
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,810
I was negligent.

357
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,070
I implicated you, My Lord.

358
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,220
You want to die?

359
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,460
What a great show.

360
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,510
Director Di.

361
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,450
Last time, you said the disciples of Demon Monk

362
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,580
are no match for you.

363
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,790
So today,

364
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,750
I've invited Rank 1 on the Who's Who of Martial Arts,

365
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,500
Buddhist Three Saints, here

366
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,180
to go a few rounds with you.

367
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,780
Are you satisfied today?

368
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,770
My Lord fought the three of them alone.

369
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,140
If it weren't for the poison on King Xunming of Yama

370
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,070
that accidentally splashed on him

371
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,010
and controlled his inner power,

372
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,420
you might not have been able to beat him.

373
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,850
My Lord.

374
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,830
You threw me

375
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,560
into that horrifying bottomless pit,

376
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,330
and had my face scratched.

377
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,490
How could you?

378
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,180
It took me a long time

379
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,840
to find such a suitable facial skin.

380
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,920
Don't worry.

381
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,050
Although you are heartless,

382
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,900
I don't blame you.

383
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,430
Your flexor tendons are broken.

384
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,300
My Lord.

385
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,520
What should I do?

386
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,180
In that case,

387
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,840
I have to...

388
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,060
Jiao Liqiao.

389
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,580
You didn't kill me.

390
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,429
You'll regret it.

391
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,760
How could I bear to kill you?

392
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,440
Enough.

393
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,469
Beauty Jiao.

394
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,090
Have you had enough fun?

395
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,840
Don't worry.

396
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,550
Shan Gudao won't be here for long.

397
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,130
He wants to use you to suppress me.

398
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:02,000
But I'm not as stupid as you.

399
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,500
Outsiders

400
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,350
will always be outsiders.

401
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,060
Shan Gudao has the wishful thinking of dominating the world.

402
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,470
Let him be.

403
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,590
When his ego inflates out of its limit,

404
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,500
he will die.

405
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,870
Looks like a fierce battle took place here.

406
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,620
Let's go.

407
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,270
Let's go in and have a look.

408
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,810
Help me!

409
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,320
Help me!

410
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,270
So the Di Fortress

411
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,500
used similar mind control techniques

412
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,020
to make people unable to resist the Master.

413
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,440
So the reason why

414
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,860
Di Feisheng agreed to cooperate with Shan Gudao

415
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,540
is that he wanted to get the karmic bugs

416
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,690
to expel the mind control techniques inside of him.

417
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,420
Now that Di Feisheng has solved

418
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,260
the matter of the Di Fortress,

419
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,410
why didn't he show up and look for me?

420
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,970
Maybe he had an accident?

421
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,370
Or, could it be

422
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,470
Di Feisheng really colluded with Shan Gudao?

423
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,160
Looks like we can only study that human skin first,

424
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,610
and find a way to suppress the karmic bugs.

425
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Master.

426
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,880
Since you know the mind control techniques,

427
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,540
do you know how to suppress it?

428
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,720
The karmic bugs

429
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,150
are of different levels.

430
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,870
Big ones can suppress small ones,

431
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,360
and mother bugs can suppress child bugs.

432
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,790
The karmic bugs are of the highest level.

433
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,820
As far as I know,

434
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,650
all mind control bugs can be suppressed by karmic bugs.

435
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,060
Mother bugs can suppress child bugs?

436
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,440
Could the way of suppressing karmic bugs

437
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,860
be the mother bugs

438
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,300
themselves?

439
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,020
Could the tattooed cyan human skin left by Liangyi Fairy

440
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,020
be pointing to the location of the mother karmic bugs?

441
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:09,780
It seems

442
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,020
Shan Gudao and I are looking for the same thing.

443
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,400
Welcome, Master.

444
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,780
Rise.

445
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,700
How is it?

446
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,610
My Yulongniuma Gang

447
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,130
is more interesting than the Jinyuan Alliance, right?

448
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,430
Since the first day

449
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,130
I saw you,

450
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,540
I've been hoping you could completely be mine.

451
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,140
I didn't expect that

452
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,140
my wish finally came true.

453
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,250
Come on. Drink with me.

454
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,500
You really have a temper.

455
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,250
Drink mine first.

456
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,580
So pretty.

457
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,530
Look at you.

458
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,250
So beautiful.

459
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Yeah.

460
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,320
So pretty.

461
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,340
Have a drink with me.

462
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,100
Drink mine.

463
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,920
Don't be ungrateful.

464
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,600
Guys.

465
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,690
This girl wanted to steal our precious martial skills.

466
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,780
Unfortunately,

467
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,260
she's not good enough.

468
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,010
She can be my bedmate.

469
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,990
You want to touch me?

470
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,100
Dream on!

471
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,490
Wicked woman.

472
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,690
Go to hell!

473
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Guishou Fenglie.

474
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,020
What's your rank on the list of who's who of martial arts again?

475
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,770
Who are you?

476
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,950
Rank 10.

477
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,760
Unimpressive.

478
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,090
Now, I'm the new Rank 10.

479
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,230
I wanted to marry you,

480
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,290
but you didn't even look at me.

481
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,850
I honored you as my lord, and you still weren't satisfied.

482
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,620
Alright then.

483
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
From now on,

484
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,280
you'll be my wife.

485
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,010
OK?

486
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,580
Take him to my room

487
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,540
and hang him up.

488
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,420
Take good care of him.

489
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,210
Why didn't you make any move?

490
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,940
I would, if it's ten years ago.

491
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,300
You're swift in making moves.

492
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,360
Looks like you've almost recovered.

493
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,180
Thank you for saving me that day.

494
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,670
I'll remember your kindness.

495
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,790
You don't have to.

496
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,800
You can buy me a drink another day.

497
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,400
Your sword is already broken.

498
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,080
Why do you still keep it?

499
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,560
A sword isn't bad just because it's old,

500
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,030
and friends don't have to be new to be good.

501
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,030
It's a good sword,

502
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,860
but I don't deserve it.

503
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,380
Why?

504
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,420
A precious sword is meant for a hero.

505
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,320
But I'm no hero.

506
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,980
Then tell me.

507
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,600
What is a hero?

508
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,010
As long as he's alive, he'll keep the sword safe.

509
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,940
He'll never give it up till he dies.

510
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,360
Where is your Shaoshi Sword?

511
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,130
You're not going to get it back?

512
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,020
Some people discard their swords like throwing out garbage,

513
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,280
while some carry their swords with them for a lifetime.

514
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,210
People's faiths

515
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,050
are different after all.

516
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,650
People do have different faiths.

517
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,690
I was wrong.

518
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,270
You really have changed.

519
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,860
Li Xiangyi wouldn't talk like that.

520
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Things are different, Zhan Yunfei.

521
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,170
It's been ten years.

522
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,920
People change.

523
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:31,730
Besides,

524
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,980
over the past ten years,

525
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,740
you've also become a different Zhan Yunfei.

526
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,750
Wear your hair up.

527
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,230
This doesn't look good to me at all.

528
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,470
I'll keep the sword.

529
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,780
I'll buy you a drink another day.

530
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,010
The outermost circle of this pattern

531
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,580
looks like a wall.

532
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,310
Then what are these inside?

533
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,360
I've almost emptied my father's study these days.

534
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,560
There are only these local records of Great Xi left.

535
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,890
See if they can be of use.

536
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:33,790
Compare this book

537
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,040
with this one, which records Nanyin's culture.

538
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,630
This symbol should stand for gods.

539
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,400
Does this pattern mean that

540
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,600
the karmic mother bugs are kept somewhere

541
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,800
related to gods?

542
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,600
When you forget about your physical body, you can enter paradise.

543
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,930
Your spirits can ascend to the fairy land.

544
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,350
This poem is actually related to gods.

545
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,300
What does it mean?

546
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,800
Could it be that

547
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,910
the place related to gods

548
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,770
is a building,

549
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,520
a temple,

550
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,310
or an immortal mansion?

551
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,310
The outermost circle does look like a wall.

552
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,160
Could the shape of the tattooed cyan human skin

553
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,780
be a city?

554
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,800
I happen to have a map of the city.

555
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,330
Let's check it thoroughly.

556
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,500
We've searched everywhere,

557
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,100
but we couldn't find a place

558
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,060
that matches the shape of the human skin.

559
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,860
Did we guess it in a wrong direction?

560
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,390
Xiaobao.

561
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,620
Father.

562
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,020
You...

563
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,700
You've brought the entire collection

564
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,770
of my precious books here.

565
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,980
-Don't worry./N-You...

566
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,100
I'll put them back in order

567
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,570
-in a few days./N-You...

568
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,890
Calm down.

569
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,190
Why do you have the map of the city?

570
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,290
Lord Fang.

571
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,990
You know this map?

572
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,030
This is the map of the Imperial City from 100 years ago.
