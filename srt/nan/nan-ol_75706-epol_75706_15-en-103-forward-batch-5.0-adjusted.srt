4
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,150
By the general's order,

5
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,430
all citizens entering the city

6
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:52,970
without

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
proper identification

8
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,680
shall be subjected to rigorous
questioning to ascertain their identity.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,590
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival,

10
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,190
the most cherished occasion

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,930
of the year for the common folk.

12
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,950
Now that the fighting has subsided,

13
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,200
we must ensure the people

14
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,840
can celebrate the festival in peace.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,400
What?

16
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,230
Why can't I enter without identification?

17
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,160
What's wrong with me just going in?

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,310
What right do you have to stop me?

19
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,370
What are you doing?

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,960
What right do you have to stop me?

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,470
What...

22
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,910
What right do you have to arrest me?

23
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,400
Let go!

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Hold him down!

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Why are you arresting me?

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,360
Behave yourself!

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm just a small merchant.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,870
Why are you arresting me?

29
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,960
You soldiers are so unreasonable!

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,890
What's going on?

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,079
General.

32
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,840
General,

33
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,800
we've captured

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,520
a suspicious person
without identification.

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,380
Mercy, My Lord!

36
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,310
I live just outside the city.

37
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,870
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,680
I only wish to go into the city
and run a little stall.

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,190
Look,

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,400
this bundle contains only small items

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,280
and trinkets.

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,750
Open it up.

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,800
Yes.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Careful, careful.

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,870
I still need to sell these.

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,930
Don't damage them.

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,840
My Lord, these are just
inexpensive trinkets.

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,400
The plains outside the city

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,130
are inhabited only by farmers.

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,280
For someone
who claims to be a street vendor,

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,080
how do you explain

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,410
the calluses on your hands
from years of riding and archery?

53
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,190
No.

54
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,870
No, My Lord!

55
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,240
My Lord!

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,500
I'm innocent, My Lord!

57
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,240
-I'm innocent!
-Send him to the government office.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,030
I'll interrogate him myself.

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,710
Yes.

60
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,310
General, I'm innocent, General!

61
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,840
Move!

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,700
General, I'm innocent, General!

63
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,450
General!

64
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,800
Excuse me.

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't have any...

66
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,710
identification either.

67
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,210
Why don't you arrest me, but only him?

68
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,220
You don't have any identification?

69
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,079
No, I don't.

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,470
Just now I swaggered into the city,

71
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,470
and your men didn't even question me.

72
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,280
How embarrassing!

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,750
They almost left me out.

74
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,960
Take me.

75
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,470
They

76
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,760
probably saw your fine clothes

77
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,210
and didn't think they needed to check.

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,190
Forgive us, General.

79
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,120
Are you done looking?

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,820
Ready to arrest me now?

81
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,000
You want to go to prison?

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Isn't this your rule?

83
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,510
Besides, I've never been there before,

84
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,370
so it might be nice to check it out.

85
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,560
Who are you?

86
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,970
Where do you come from?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,910
Well,

88
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,400
I can't tell you.

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,260
What do you want

90
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,150
in Lucheng?

91
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,630
Even if I told you,

92
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,380
you wouldn't understand.

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,570
She's questioning you,

94
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,510
so reply to each point directly.

95
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,240
Don't beat around the bush.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
At the border,

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,720
food is scarce and expensive.

98
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,520
If you want to go to prison, fine,

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
but you'll have to

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,060
pay for your own meals.

101
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,510
Fine.

102
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,310
You're right.

103
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,630
My money pouch

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,270
seems to be missing.

105
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,720
Here,

106
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,750
this hairpin

107
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,409
should cover plenty of meals.

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,260
Then you'll get your wish,

109
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,180
but once you're in prison,

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,040
you'll inevitably suffer
some physical punishment.

111
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,160
And when that happens,

112
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,220
no matter whose precious son you are,

113
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,600
I won't

114
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,880
release you easily.

115
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,830
Take him away.

116
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,560
Yes.

117
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,000
Move.

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,190
This hairpin

119
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,280
is enough to feed him
in prison for a lifetime.

120
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,240
I hope he's not some noble's son

121
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,310
coming here to make fun of us.

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Inform the warden

123
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,330
to keep a close watch on him.

124
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,040
Yes.

125
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,909
As for today's incident,

126
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,659
I won't pursue it further for now.

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,050
But if there are any more mistakes,

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,560
the entire squad

129
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,250
will lose half a year's pay.

130
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,670
-Thank you, General.
-Thank you, General.

131
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,430
Here you are. Take it.

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,280
Wait a moment.

133
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,170
Lu Xin.

134
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,920
Closing so early?

135
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,370
It's a festival today.

136
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,970
Who would come for medicine?

137
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,060
That's true.

138
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,190
Since you've closed up the shop,

139
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,000
why not go out for a walk?

140
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,100
The streets are full of couples,

141
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,750
and I'd be all alone,

142
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,360
talking to myself.

143
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,159
No fun at all.

144
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,830
If you're bored,

145
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,750
wait for me at the General's Residence.

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,310
I'll keep you company
after I finish patrolling.

147
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,170
You said the same thing last year,

148
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,920
but you ended up reading
military books all night.

149
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,120
I might as well snack on seeds at my shop.

150
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,640
Why are you personally patrolling today?

151
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,270
It's all because of Jin'an.

152
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,110
He insists that I learn to

153
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,480
enjoy life,

154
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,240
pushing me to play instruments and paint,

155
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,870
but I don't have that talent.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Don't talk about enjoying life.

157
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,400
It's practically torture.

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,240
Don't you have

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
any other feelings except complaining?

160
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Like

161
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,850
a sweet feeling in your heart?

162
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,720
Have you been reading

163
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,159
some ridiculous romance novels again?

164
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,950
You're as stubborn as a mule.

165
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
Jin'an is right.

166
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,720
All these years,
you've been the General of Taijin,

167
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
the Li family's daughter,

168
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,950
and the Beautiful Lord of Hell.

169
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,070
You've fulfilled every role dutifully,

170
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,310
but you've forgotten

171
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,370
that you're still an ordinary woman.

172
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,240
What's wrong with being an ordinary woman?

173
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,510
Do ordinary women have to

174
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,570
play musical instruments and paint?

175
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,040
Can't they do anything else?

176
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,000
What matters isn't what you do,

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,390
but that you try everything

178
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,390
and have choices.

179
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,560
On some things,

180
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
Jin'an and I seem to think alike.

181
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,480
You don't

182
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,680
have to limit your life

183
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,140
to swords and spears only.

184
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,510
This dress

185
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,920
was custom-made at great expense
from the embroidery shop.

186
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,180
It's the only one of its kind
in the world.

187
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,040
I've wanted to give it to you
for a long time,

188
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
but I knew

189
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,510
you would make
all kinds of excuses to refuse it before.

190
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,430
However, Shuang,

191
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,070
I hope you can set aside your concerns

192
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,630
and live happily for yourself just once,

193
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,350
even if it's just for one day,

194
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,909
alright?

195
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,799
Since you're so thoughtful,

196
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,510
I'll

197
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,250
return the favor with a grand gift.

198
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,390
Why are you here?

199
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,080
I calculated it was time
for you to return home,

200
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,340
so I came to escort you.

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,730
Today is the Lantern Festival.

202
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,030
I've heard

203
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,000
the Lantern Festival
has lanterns glowing all night

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
and it's incredibly lively.

205
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,670
Let's go take a look.

206
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,200
Are you asking me

207
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,010
to celebrate with you?

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,750
No.

209
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,600
I just thought you probably
haven't seen lanterns before,

210
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,750
and I was worried
you'd be bored alone at home.

211
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,640
Why are you asking so many questions?

212
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,500
If you don't want to go, forget it.

213
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,510
I didn't mean that.

214
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,000
After all,

215
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,390
this is your first time asking me out.

216
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,690
I wouldn't dare spoil your good mood.

217
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,680
It's quite lively outside.

218
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,120
Sir, do you know what's happening outside?

219
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,030
Why are you quiet?

220
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,910
Hello.

221
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,320
What's your surname?

222
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,960
Where are you from?

223
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,870
Are you also locked up here

224
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,670
because

225
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,600
you don't have that identification?

226
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,960
We're about to die.

227
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,670
Can you just shut up

228
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,240
and be quiet for a moment?

229
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,210
When will your companions

230
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,560
come to rescue you?

231
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,880
Brother Chen,

232
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,390
we just walked into the inn so boldly.

233
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,270
Shouldn't we

234
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,870
be more cautious and keep a low profile?

235
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,550
Indeed,

236
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,840
the Jin people are vigilant.

237
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,030
If not for Brother Chen's
careful planning today,

238
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,390
deliberately having Wu
expose himself at the city gate

239
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,720
to distract the guards,

240
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,630
I'm afraid

241
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,640
we might not have all made it in.

242
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,240
Now Lucheng

243
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,990
is on high alert everywhere.

244
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,910
If we try too hard to disguise ourselves,

245
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,710
we'll only draw more attention.

246
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,270
I just

247
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,600
really feel sorry for Wu.

248
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,750
Don't worry, Brother Chen.

249
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,750
We are death-sworn warriors
of the Left Minister's Mansion.

250
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,670
Taking risks for the greater cause

251
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,720
is our duty.

252
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,720
Right now,

253
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
the most important thing is to figure out

254
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,740
what we should do next.

255
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,340
Let's stay calm first,

256
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,090
and continue our investigation in Lucheng.

257
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,390
That day,

258
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,870
just after we left,

259
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,550
Zang Budu was murdered.

260
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,480
It seems

261
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,550
we're getting closer to Prince Annan

262
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,820
than ever before.

263
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

264
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,550
In front of me,

265
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,310
why do you still pretend?

266
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,240
I've been following you
all the way from Ninglan.

267
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,630
When I saw you were in trouble,

268
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,490
I didn't care about anything else

269
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,440
and followed you

270
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,750
onto the prison cart.

271
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,360
I... I...

272
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,130
I was wrongfully arrested

273
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,480
and locked up here!

274
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,000
I...

275
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

276
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,720
Could it be that

277
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,320
they sacrificed you as a diversion

278
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,360
and made you a disposable pawn?

279
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,030
You talk too much.

280
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,550
I still lost track of them after all.

281
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,960
And now I have to
waste my memory-erasing pill.

282
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,790
Sleep now,

283
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,520
and when you wake up,
you won't remember me.

284
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,380
Since that's the case,

285
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,930
I'll have to go out
and search more carefully.

286
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
Besides,

287
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,610
on such a beautiful night,

288
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,510
I can't let it go to waste.

289
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,960
Make way!

290
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,000
The dragon is coming!

291
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,320
Great!

292
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,780
What's with the long face?

293
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,520
If you're unhappy, I'm even more unhappy.

294
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,910
No matter how I asked Shuang out before,

295
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,390
she might not even come.

296
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,120
This year

297
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,340
she finally asked me out for once,

298
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,700
but I never thought
she'd bring you along too!

299
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,160
A quarter past five,
center of the main street.

300
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,430
This is the place.

301
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,600
Where is she?

302
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,600
She's probably held up
by something at the military camp.

303
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,150
I don't know.

304
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,240
You'll get used to it.

305
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,840
Make way!

306
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,670
Make way! Make way!

307
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,720
The dragon is coming!

308
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,600
The dragon is coming!

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,530
Dragon! Jin'an!

310
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,420
Make way, make way!

311
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,390
Make way!

312
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,320
Thank you.

313
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,970
Shuang!

314
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,030
You look beautiful!

315
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,440
I have such good taste.

316
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,630
And the size is perfect.

317
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,910
Really beautiful.

318
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,480
If you keep staring like this,

319
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,670
it'll be dawn soon.

320
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,270
You look so pretty

321
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,600
in this outfit.

322
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,510
This silk dress

323
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,200
has layers upon layers.

324
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm suffocating.

325
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,200
You can wear armor,

326
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,240
but can't handle this light silk dress?

327
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,500
Stop complaining, you'll get used to it.

328
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,600
General.

329
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,750
Why did you invite him?

330
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,440
Didn't I say I'd give you a gift?

331
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,120
He is the gift!

332
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
What kind of gift is this?

333
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,910
He already spent his money
on you last time.

334
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,510
I saw everything.

335
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,790
You two are as close as a couple now.

336
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,940
What's there to be shy about?

337
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,670
You've misunderstood.

338
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,910
Don't be shy.

339
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,360
Don't be shy.

340
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,000
Tonight

341
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,150
we won't talk about work.

342
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,750
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

343
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,000
Um,

344
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,369
there's a lantern show over there.

345
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,270
Where's the lantern show?

346
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,130
There's a fireworks show over there.

347
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,390
I have no choice

348
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,750
but to obey the general's orders.

349
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,440
If you feel uncomfortable,

350
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,680
I can leave first.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,270
Tonight is a rare festive occasion.

352
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,720
There's no harm in walking around.

353
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,320
Though we aren't meant to be,

354
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,010
we can still be friends,

355
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,310
right?

356
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,830
Here.

357
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,880
Take it.

358
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,280
Let's go.

359
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,210
Are we really just walking away like this?

360
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
What's wrong with that?

361
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm creating opportunities for them.

362
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,750
You don't understand.

363
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,070
But one of them

364
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,750
is just following orders,

365
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,440
and the other is doing it reluctantly.

366
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,640
Both look

367
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,960
kind of awkward.

368
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,720
Not at all!

369
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,400
They're just being shy and bashful.

370
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,440
How can you be so clueless?

371
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,640
So dense.

372
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,530
You won't be invited
to their wedding at this rate.

373
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,160
Look how well-matched they are!

374
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,880
Look!

375
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,310
Brother, she's so beautiful!

376
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,160
Buy her a flower, please.

377
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,510
How much?

378
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
Three coins each.

379
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,550
Come here, little girl.

380
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,270
Give me your hand.

381
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,110
Here you go.

382
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,550
You're beautiful and rich.

383
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,680
Brother, you're so lucky.

384
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,960
Take care.

385
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,550
It's not what you think.

386
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm rich too.

387
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,680
When did you become so showy?

388
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,310
Shouting about your wealth
in the middle of the street?

389
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,750
But I do have money!

390
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,800
I just handed it all over to you.

391
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,270
Now for no reason

392
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,660
that little girl thinks
I'm some kind of kept man.

393
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,510
Is that fair?

394
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,200
You do have a point.

395
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Well,

396
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,250
to avoid any further misunderstandings,

397
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,910
I'll give you all the money.

398
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,540
Take it.

399
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,690
I'm leaving.

400
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,080
Take the lantern too.

401
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,370
I've given you all the money,

402
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,790
so don't ask me for any more.

403
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,790
Hold it properly.

404
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,350
Isn't this making it worse?

405
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,750
Stay calm.

406
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,310
Calm down.

407
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,590
Just do it!

408
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,240
The General is on the main street.

409
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,830
No,

410
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,570
I came looking for you.

411
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,280
I heard you're on duty tonight.

412
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,410
I came specially...

413
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,550
specially...

414
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,030
to bring you this.

415
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,680
Masks for sale!

416
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,810
Pick whatever you like!

417
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,670
Help yourself!

418
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,510
Right.

419
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,740
Feel free to look around.

420
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,510
Sir,

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,590
how come I've never seen anyone

422
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,000
selling this sort of face mask before?

423
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,750
You two

424
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,270
must be from out of town, right?

425
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,200
Do you know

426
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
Lucheng has four treasures?

427
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
Lucheng has four treasures?

428
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,800
They say Lucheng has three treasures:

429
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,310
honey, deer antler,
and green jade chicken.

430
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,920
What is this fourth treasure, then?

431
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,720
You're holding it in your hands!

432
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,550
You two may not know,

433
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,750
but just recently,

434
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,000
here in Lucheng,

435
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
a great hero appeared,

436
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,880
the man in black.

437
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,140
Just a few days ago

438
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,910
during the border battle,

439
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,030
that heroic man in black

440
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,680
used magical tactics

441
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,510
and supernatural power

442
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,960
to single-handedly

443
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,750
drive back
50,000 soldiers of the Yao Army!

444
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,820
Bravo!

445
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,620
When did you learn such magical tactics?

446
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,590
Take your time. Pick whatever you like.

447
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,880
This is what we call
the sublimation of art.

448
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,830
That's nothing.

449
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,400
And this great hero

450
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,720
charged alone into the enemy camp

451
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,240
and joined forces with
General Li of the Changfeng Army

452
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,960
to strike down that scheming counsellor

453
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,310
from his horse!

454
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,110
Those 50,000 Yao soldiers
were so terrified

455
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,550
that they wet themselves,

456
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,480
fled like rats,

457
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,790
and retreated through the night

458
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,070
for more than 50 li!

459
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,920
Bravo!

460
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,750
What a pity!

461
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,070
What a pity!

462
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,830
About this noble hero

463
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,630
with unmatched martial skills,

464
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,200
we never had the chance

465
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,440
to learn

466
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,240
his name or background.

467
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,880
He only

468
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,880
left behind this

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,960
magnificent mask.

470
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,350
Now you tell me,

471
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,400
does this mask

472
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
deserve to be Lucheng's

473
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,000
fourth treasure?

474
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
Yes, indeed!

475
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,310
I'll take one!

476
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,750
OK.

477
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,480
Come on!

478
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,000
Pick whatever you like!

479
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,310
Don't push! Don't push!

480
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,830
Line up, everyone!

481
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,590
What are you doing?

482
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,200
Help yourself!

483
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
Why are you walking away?

484
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,270
Go listen to

485
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,730
how they're praising you.

486
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,550
There are too many people.

487
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,750
I'm afraid you'll get pushed around.

488
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,070
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

489
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,640
Let's go.

490
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,200
I don't want you to get hurt.

491
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,460
Let me pick one for you.

492
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,160
Everyone, please don't push!

493
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,110
The man in black is right in front of you.

494
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,240
Why did you say that?

495
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,200
Let's go.

496
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,260
Have a look.

497
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,360
Thank you for accompanying me for so long.

498
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,720
Shuang has some misunderstandings.

499
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,510
But she rarely gets to relax,

500
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,000
and I don't want to spoil her mood,

501
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
though I've probably ruined yours.

502
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,260
I don't think that way.

503
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,050
You're overthinking.

504
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,550
You can stop being polite now.

505
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,240
Compared to this insincere politeness,

506
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
I actually prefer

507
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,550
your previous hurtful bluntness

508
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,480
as it sounds more pleasant to my ears,

509
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,200
at least it was genuine.

510
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
My gratitude

511
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,480
is also sincere.

512
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,160
But you can't thank me forever

513
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,490
for such a small matter.

514
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,360
I've received all your compensation.

515
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,790
I told you back at Cang Mountain

516
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,510
that I wouldn't cling to you anymore

517
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,880
and I keep my word.

518
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,750
Doesn't Shuang look beautiful today?

519
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,610
It's the first time
I've seen her dressed like this.

520
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,830
You clearly have feelings for her

521
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,630
but you won't tell her how you feel.

522
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,720
If you don't tell her,

523
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,680
she is so dense

524
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,330
that she'll never understand.

525
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,830
I don't understand
all this restraint and propriety.

526
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,920
If you get rejected, then so be it.

527
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,200
It won't cost you a penny.

528
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,270
Life is too short

529
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,110
to live with regrets.

530
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,590
Anyway, it's your business.

531
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,200
I don't really want to get involved.

532
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm tired.

533
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm heading back to sleep first.

534
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,720
You should go rest early too.

535
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,200
I'll find a chance

536
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,600
to clear things up with Shuang.

537
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,530
I won't cause you any more trouble.

538
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,350
The candied haws are for you.

539
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,550
Thanks for spending time with me today.

540
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,960
I am not worthy.

541
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,110
You are pretty and intelligent.

542
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,630
You will find a good match someday.

543
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,350
Of course.

544
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,000
I will definitely meet

545
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,160
a great man.

546
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,160
You will be jealous then.

547
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,370
I'm leaving.

548
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
Luckily, I didn't listen to Jin'an.

549
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,180
Giving flowers and plants

550
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,280
isn't as practical as giving food.

551
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,880
What are you

552
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,410
mumbling about over there?

553
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,400
Nothing.

554
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,930
I was just saying

555
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,590
this is the best date cake in Lucheng.

556
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,270
Don't you always like it?

557
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,470
I bought some for you.

558
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,480
By the way,

559
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,960
as soon as their stall opens,

560
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,550
everything sells out quickly.

561
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,000
How did you manage to get some?

562
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,330
And they're still warm.

563
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,400
They're doing me a favour.

564
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,370
These two dozen are freshly made.

565
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,030
You're abusing your power?

566
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,030
No, I'm not.

567
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,640
Take them back.

568
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,300
Apologize.

569
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,280
Apologize...

570
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,400
No way.

571
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Will you go or not?

572
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,680
What am I apologizing for?

573
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,550
I haggled with Old Chen for ages

574
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,880
and put in a ton of effort.

575
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,070
I spent the whole afternoon

576
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,240
making festival lanterns for his yard.

577
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,500
That's how I got these freshly made ones.

578
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,070
Why?

579
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,640
Why...

580
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,680
Well...

581
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,070
Well...

582
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,720
You know...

583
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,500
It's a festival today.

584
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,310
I've noticed you don't have many hobbies.

585
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,480
Besides eating, you mostly
practice martial arts.

586
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,200
As for fighting,

587
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,920
well, you know how it is.

588
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,980
Let's just skip it.

589
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,880
So I can only do my best

590
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,960
to treat you

591
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
to some nice food.

592
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,830
You?

593
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,790
Treat me?

594
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,200
I hate beating around the bush,

595
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
so I'll just say it straight.

596
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,750
Qiao,

597
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,720
I fancy you.

598
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,480
I know

599
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,640
we're not that familiar with each other,

600
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,400
but honestly,

601
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,880
life is just about eating,
drinking, and the daily routines.

602
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,720
Let's find time to

603
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,440
grab more meals together,

604
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,750
and if we can get along well,

605
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,750
that will be great...

606
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,350
OK.

607
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,920
Yes,

608
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
this is a bit sudden.

609
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,310
It's OK if you don't agree today,

610
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,110
Anyway, I'm off work
tomorrow and the day after.

611
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,680
But...

612
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,270
You...

613
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,560
What did you just say?

614
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,680
I said...

615
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,350
OK.

616
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,510
OK.

617
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,440
The general took you in,

618
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,680
which means

619
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,550
you're a decent man.

620
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,310
Besides,

621
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,880
your martial skills are really impressive.

622
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,070
With our combined strength,

623
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,070
the children we have

624
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,510
will surely be as strong as bulls.

625
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,400
Then,

626
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,830
we can have a dozen or so children.

627
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,510
After training,

628
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,960
they'll form a powerful team

629
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,070
that'll guarantee the general's safety!

630
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,070
What do you think?

631
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,000
A dozen or so?

632
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,590
You don't want to?

633
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,310
No, it's not that.

634
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm just suddenly

635
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,160
feeling a bit conflicted.

636
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,690
Then I'll take that as a yes.

637
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,590
Come on.

638
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,400
Come on.

639
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,490
It used to keep me company.

640
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,000
From now on,

641
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,650
it's your turn.

642
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,510
Who are you?

643
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,750
You almost pushed me into the river!

644
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
I thought you were trying
to end your life,

645
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,030
so I wanted to pull you back.

646
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,500
I didn't expect you to be ungrateful

647
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,760
and turn on me instead.

648
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,590
My back!

649
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,070
Your back?

650
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,480
My back!

651
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,640
I was just admiring the sparkling water,

652
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,960
and wanted to get a closer look.

653
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,160
You're really strange.

654
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,590
Earlier you were clearly upset,

655
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,270
yet you smiled and said
everything was fine.

656
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,680
Now you're over the moon

657
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,100
just watching me make a fool of myself.

658
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,720
You sneaky eavesdropper,

659
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,030
you've been listening in, haven't you?

660
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
That's my psychological strategy.

661
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,630
I don't have a chance anyway.

662
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,510
The more gracious, composed,

663
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,750
and reasonable I am,

664
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,560
the more guilty he'll feel.

665
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,170
And I'll make him drown in that guilt.

666
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,310
I didn't expect such a young lady

667
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,350
to be so calculating.

668
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,830
I must say,

669
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,710
I'm impressed.

670
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
Regretting it now?

671
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,380
You clearly have so much to say

672
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,030
yet you keep it all bottled up.

673
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,090
The one who suffers

674
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,860
will ultimately be yourself.

675
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,880
Everyone in this world

676
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,830
wears a mask to some degree.

677
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,460
Besides,

678
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,600
even if you want to speak,

679
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,250
there may not be anyone willing to listen.

680
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,310
People back where I'm from

681
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,170
just say whatever they feel like.

682
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,750
Life is meant

683
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,400
to be lived freely

684
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,230
and as one pleases.

685
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,440
Your people?

686
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,330
Where are you from?

687
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,600
I think you're just
carefree and thoughtless.

688
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,160
Boss,

689
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,520
give me some.

690
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,640
Sure, these, right? Take them all.

691
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Excuse me.

692
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,010
Give me some rings, please.

693
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,110
Thank you.

694
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
These past few years,

695
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,310
the Lantern Festival

696
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,940
has always been my most tense period,

697
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,440
filled with fears of unrest in the city

698
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,750
and Yao State's lying in wait.

699
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,730
But this year is different.

700
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,270
Is it because I'm here

701
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,310
that makes it different?

702
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,920
Yes.

703
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,889
Every single day from now on

704
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,800
I'll be here.

705
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,800
I can't just put down
my sword for one person.

706
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,030
In the future,

707
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
you will face countless waits.

708
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,280
Because it's you,

709
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,670
all the waiting

710
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,770
will turn into expectations.

711
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,330
I smell sulfur and saltpeter.

712
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
This place is dangerous.

713
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,680
Let's go, now!

714
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,800
What?

715
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,280
Thank you

716
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,090
