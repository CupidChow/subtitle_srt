4
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,380
What's wrong?

5
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,660
The jade pendant hanging on his waist

6
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,289
shouldn't be this heavy.

[A promise of life and death]

8
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,460
A promise of life and death.

9
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:04,300
The life-and-death jade?

10
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,190
You know about it too?

11
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,140
The life-and-death jade is the proof of contract with the royal family.

12
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,260
By accepting this contract,

13
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,780
the family is obliged to serve the royal family forever.

14
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,520
But Liu Kehe's family

15
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,100
worked in the Ministry of Works for generations.

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,900
Their positions weren't high either.

17
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,260
Why do they own a piece of life-and-death jade?

18
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,500
Who did they make the contract with?

19
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,920
The answer

20
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,870
is in the Pagoda of Bliss.

21
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,100
Imperial Preceptor.

22
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,740
Why do you have to enter the palace in the middle of the night to choose the address?

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,150
A murder happened a few days ago.

24
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,430
It's not safe at night.

25
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,220
I purposely chose to come here at night.

26
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,630
Because when the moon is the brightest,

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,410
the direction of Fengshui becomes most obvious.

28
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,900
Why are there new recruits today?

29
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,590
The ministry's craftsmen were killed.

30
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,960
We were short of hands.

31
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,870
So I asked people from the Wansheng Clan to help.

32
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,590
This matter has been delayed for too long.

33
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,540
We should speed up.

34
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,850
I'll ask them to search the place right away.

35
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,290
Everyone.

36
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,970
I come with Empress Dowager's verbal instructions!

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,400
Eunuch Wang, please take the Imperial Preceptor and all craftsmen

38
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,770
to Mingluan Garden immediately.

39
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,880
She wishes to discuss something important.

40
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,270
Everyone?

41
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,730
Yes.

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,710
Faking the Empress Dowager's verbal instructions...

43
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,490
Fang Xiaobao,

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,329
you owe the princess another favor.

45
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,510
This is an important matter.

46
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,450
I hope we can stall them for a while.

47
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,750
Let's start searching.

48
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,190
Over there.

49
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,420
This way.

50
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,980
Strange.

51
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,350
We've searched everywhere.

52
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,260
It doesn't look like

53
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,940
there's a tower hidden anywhere.

54
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,980
Did we pick the wrong direction?

55
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,540
Or

56
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,780
is there some kind of illusion

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
that we missed out?

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,780
Li Lianhua.

59
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,820
Why are you spacing out?

60
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,220
The Demon Monk will be back if we don't find it soon.

61
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,020
It should be nearby.

62
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,460
The Pagoda of Bliss is a tower.

63
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,510
But why is the entrance a well?

64
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,650
Maybe the pagoda is gone.

65
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,040
But the treasure is still there.

66
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,260
So they must have entered

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,780
a secret room in the well instead.

68
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,120
Think about it.

69
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,460
Li Fei and others have been to the Pagoda of Bliss.

70
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,150
That means if we fall into the well,

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,580
we can find the pagoda.

72
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,100
Was Zhao Chi's action before he died

73
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,560
hinting at something?

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,810
You mean

75
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,460
the Pagoda of Bliss is in the well?

76
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,340
How is that possible?

77
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,300
Did the Pagoda of Bliss become a well?

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,840
I got it.

79
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,010
The Pagoda of Bliss is a well.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,880
Look.

81
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,930
Well.

82
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,850
Pagoda.

83
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,260
When Zhao Chi died,

84
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,260
he hinted that the pagoda is a well.

85
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,640
Such an abstruse design.

86
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,980
I understand now.

87
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,700
It's the Iron Mountain Collapse.

88
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,020
You've heard of it too?

89
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,850
In the Book of Mechanisms,

90
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,010
there is a Blood Realm mining mechanism called the

91
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,540
Iron Mountain Collapse.

92
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,350
They first hang an extremely heavy weight up high.

93
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,420
Then, by suddenly reversing the mechanism,

94
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,480
the weight will rapidly fall down,

95
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,750
smash a hole into the ground,

96
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,330
and pour stucco into the hole.

97
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,340
In an instant, a small mine cave will be created.

98
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,130
There was a heavy weight at the top of the pagoda.

99
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,430
Each level of the pagoda was connected too.

100
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,980
On the night of the disappearance,

101
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,540
someone reversed the mechanism

102
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,470
and let the heavy weight at the top of the pagoda fall rapidly.

103
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,020
It penetrated the ground layer

104
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,970
and sank the entire pagoda underground.

105
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,220
And so, the pagoda became a well overnight.

106
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,100
The well opening must be well hidden.

107
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,700
There was no need for Liu Kehe

108
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,900
to fill the well more than ten years ago.

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,540
It should be Xue Kuan.

110
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,090
After he got drunk,

111
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,770
he accidentally found the entrance.

112
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,890
Then, to find the entrance to the Pagoda of Bliss,

113
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,550
we need to think about where a drunk person

114
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,750
would go in an abandoned garden.

115
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,140
Drunk.

116
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,659
Moonlight.

117
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,900
Osmanthus.

118
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,200
If he wanted to admire the moon or rest his legs,

119
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,940
wouldn't he look for a pavilion?

120
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,930
Wait.

121
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,260
Eunuch Wu wrote this poem.

122
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,290
He used to serve Emperor Guangqing

123
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,360
and stayed closely by his side.

124
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,820
He was such a busy man,

125
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,370
yet he had the time to admire the moon and write poems.

126
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,890
Don't you think it's suspicious?

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,740
Unless his poem has a hidden meaning.

128
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,060
The Hanyun fluffs piled in a corner.

129
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,800
Gathering them, I made a flowerbed.

130
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,430
There isn't a place called Hanyun

131
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,620
in the palace.

132
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,730
Maybe it's the name of the pavilion.

133
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,540
And this one.

134
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,390
Flying snow turns into rain.

135
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,650
The snow turned into rain in mid-air.

136
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,480
It means the temperature was high.

137
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,290
Could it be...

138
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,760
A hot spring pool?

139
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
The Iron Mountain Collapse could only be built on soft soil.

140
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,050
Naturally, a spot with water is more suitable.

141
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,920
Liu Kehe's construction booklet.

142
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,020
On the 8th of July,

143
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,530
we dismantled the Hanyun pavilion,

144
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,700
filled the Liuye pond,

145
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,260
and built a stone mountain.

146
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,659
It's here.

147
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,870
The base of the pavilion is still here.

148
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,870
The rocks look like they weigh hundreds of kilograms.

149
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:11,990
Fang Xiaobao.

150
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,300
Can you do it?

151
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,380
Li Lianhua.

152
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,530
Just watch me.

153
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,800
The spiritual tower leads to mysteries.

154
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,190
Move not and obtain bliss.

155
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
This well was formed when the Pagoda of Bliss was inverted.

156
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,050
Looks like we've found the right place.

157
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,530
Let's go over there.

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,850
Come and have a look.

159
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,340
So many treasures.

160
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,780
This should be the main hall of the Pagoda of Bliss.

161
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,050
When Xue Kuan and the others found this place,

162
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,370
it was hard for them to resist their greed.

163
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,430
The people who accidentally entered the pagoda back then

164
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,210
must have seen these veiled hats too.

165
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,040
Maybe someone wore such a hat

166
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,200
and escaped with the treasures.

167
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,280
Liu Kehe who had been guarding nearby

168
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,660
found that they accidentally entered the pagoda.

169
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,060
So he released the tiger to bite Xue Kuan to death.

170
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,830
The rest of them were traumatized by the event.

171
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,790
That's why Liu Kehe

172
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,420
just had to hang a veiled hat

173
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,680
in the White Jade Academy

174
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,540
to terrify them.

175
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,850
Liu Kehe sure went out of his way

176
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,000
to protect the treasures here.

177
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,800
If this pagoda were that simple,

178
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
the person who sealed this tower 100 years ago

179
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,050
should have taken

180
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,100
these treasures long ago.

181
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,390
Forget it.

182
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,060
Let's not think about that.

183
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,940
Our priority is to find the mother bug.

184
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,300
Fang Xiaobao.

185
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,470
The Rama Vessel.

186
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,950
It's not the same one.

187
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,810
But the shape is exactly the same.

188
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,700
This one

189
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,330
must have been sealed here

190
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,970
with the Pagoda of Bliss 100 years ago.

191
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,820
Look.

192
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,040
The vessel is broken.

193
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,390
Is the mother bug inside?

194
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,920
Look at this male body.

195
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,090
There's a hole between his eyebrows.

196
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,680
You're right.

197
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,980
Why is that?

198
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,090
Karmic bugs

199
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,670
feed on blood and flesh.

200
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,280
They're especially fond of the human head marrow.

201
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,100
Since the vessel is broken,

202
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,850
after the mother bug woke up,

203
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,580
she'd definitely look for blood and flesh to eat.

204
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,180
As such,

205
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,840
the mother bug is in his head.

206
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,510
Demon Monk!

207
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,780
Thank you for your help.

208
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,110
I'll be taking the mother bug.

209
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,930
The two of you can die here in the Pagoda of Bliss instead.

210
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,040
Darn it. He took the mother bug.

211
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,830
Wait.

212
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,600
It's in the vessel.

213
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,020
I saw a movement outside the door,

214
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,520
so I only said half of my words.

215
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,190
It's been decades since the mother bug

216
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,360
fed on this male body.

217
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,520
Once nothing was left,

218
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,340
she returned to her nest to hibernate.

219
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,330
The vessel is her nest.

220
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,630
Go ahead, open it.

221
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,820
It's really inside.

222
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,580
I'm afraid we can't hide this for long.

223
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,890
Shan Gudao will be here for it soon.

224
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,460
Li Lianhua.

225
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,340
It will be a tough battle later.

226
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
You'd better hide.

227
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,860
Why fight a tough battle?

228
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,370
Since we have the stuff,

229
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,870
the most important thing now

230
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,230
is to find a chance to escape.

231
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,860
I have so many traps waiting to be used.

232
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,910
If not now,

233
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,640
when will I ever use them?

234
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,330
Good for you.

235
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:22,720
I found it.

236
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:23,960
You found it?

237
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,300
Why is it empty?

238
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,210
Li Lianhua tricked us.

239
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,670
Li Xiangyi.

240
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,640
Even if you swallow the mother bug this time,

241
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,040
I'll cut your belly open and get it.

242
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,530
Li Lianhua.

243
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,690
I found a secret passage out of here

244
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,310
when I was setting the traps.

245
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,210
We can go now.

246
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,070
What are you looking at?

247
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,120
Did you hear me?

248
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,540
I know why the Pagoda of Bliss

249
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,580
disappeared overnight.

250
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,020
Why?

251
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,710
The words and murals were carved on the wall

252
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,330
to cover up a huge secret.

253
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,780
The biggest secret in the pagoda is not these treasures,

254
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,170
but the man on the bed.

255
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,550
This body belonged to the

256
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,240
long-deceased Nanyin sorcerer,

257
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,460
Feng Ahlu.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,440
Feng Ahlu, the man who could control the karmic bugs?

259
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,960
No wonder the karmic bug is here.

260
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,670
A hundred years ago, Emperor Guangqing had no offspring.

261
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,240
He built the Pagoda of Bliss to change the Fengshui and pray for a son.

262
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,950
Feng Ahlu pretended to be a craftsman,

263
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,420
[Feng Ahlu]

264
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,370
mixed into the palace,

265
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,000
and intended to use the mother bug in the Rama Vessel

266
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,500
to assassinate Emperor Guangqing.

267
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,610
But when he sneaked into the palace for the assassination,

268
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,810
he ran into Consort Ying instead.

269
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,500
[Consort Ying]

270
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,520
He fell for her unparalleled beauty

271
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,500
and thought they were destined to be together.

272
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,990
For Consort Ying,

273
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,490
the sorcerer forgot his mission

274
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,880
and willingly became her secret lover.

275
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
He looked forward to meeting

276
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,560
Consort Ying every day.

277
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,450
The sorcerer was hidden in the Pagoda of Bliss,

278
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,340
where he often met Consort Ying in private.

279
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,700
Soon,

280
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,040
Consort Ying finally got pregnant.

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,820
The sorcerer thought that after Consort Ying gave birth,

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
she would take the child and elope with him.

283
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,460
Consort Ying was pregnant for ten months.

284
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,740
The sorcerer waited eagerly for her for ten months.

285
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
But when Consort Ying gave birth,

286
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,860
the sorcerer fell into the underground with the Pagoda of Bliss

287
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,900
and never saw the sun again.

288
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,830
The entire pagoda

289
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,660
was Consort Ying's plan.

290
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,990
Emperor Guangqing

291
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,660
was infertile.

292
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,200
Consort Ying wanted a child.

293
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,000
So she planned the whole thing

294
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,380
to become the queen

295
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,670
and seize power.

296
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,190
After that, she destroyed all the records

297
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,490
related to the Pagoda of Bliss.

298
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,010
Sorcerer Feng Ahlu

299
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,860
was buried underground with the Pagoda of Bliss.

300
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,190
That's why he was full of anger

301
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,380
and drew these.

302
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,560
In the end, he died in slow agony.

303
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,740
But if Emperor Guangqing’s son

304
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,940
is the son of the sorcerer, then...

305
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,700
After Emperor Guangqing,

306
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,360
the royal bloodline was lost.

307
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
If this gets out,

308
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,220
the world will be in chaos.

309
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,650
So the Pagoda of Bliss

310
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,380
must be a secret forever.

311
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,060
No wonder Liu Kehe

312
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,520
would rather kill and commit suicide

313
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,980
than let anyone find out the secret.

314
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,910
Consort Ying and the Liu family made the contract

315
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,810
and promised to employ the Liu family for generations.

316
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,820
So they conspired to build

317
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,770
the Pagoda of Bliss.

318
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,460
Not only was the pagoda equipped with the Iron Mountain Collapse,

319
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,320
it also had a secret room.

320
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,340
This pagoda was designed

321
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,220
to keep this secret forever.

322
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,460
The secret passage you just mentioned

323
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,050
is the one where Feng Ahlu and Consort Ying used to meet in private,

324
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,870
right?

325
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,319
Oh no.

326
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,290
They are here.

327
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,400
Come with me.

328
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,470
Let's go!

329
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,010
They escaped.

330
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,140
Li Xiangyi!

331
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,810
It's okay.

332
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,300
They can't escape.

333
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,540
This secret passage

334
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,370
should lead to somewhere in the palace.

335
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,830
It's not convenient for me

336
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,980
to openly search

337
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,290
the palace yards yet.

338
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,570
I can only count on you now.

339
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,810
What's going on?

340
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,380
Someone must have reported to the Imperial City Division.

341
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,700
They're here to stop us.

342
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,220
That's right. You're correct.

343
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,800
Here comes His Majesty.

344
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

345
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,010
Be careful, Your Majesty.

346
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,630
The vessel in his hand

347
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,220
is for poisoning people.

348
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,460
I shall capture him.

349
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,620
Don't bother, Imperial Preceptor.

350
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,220
The Imperial City Division should keep the evidence.

351
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,790
Your Majesty.

352
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,270
Li Lianhua, Fang Duobing.

353
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,020
When the Imperial Preceptor said you dug a secret passage

354
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,250
in the imperial harem and wanted to rebel,

355
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,230
I didn't believe it.

356
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,430
But I see it's true.

357
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,400
Your Majesty,

358
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,140
we didn't dig the secret passage.

359
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,630
We don't plan to rebel either.

360
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,600
Then tell me,

361
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,910
why are you digging a secret passage

362
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,660
in the imperial harem instead of

363
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,460
investigating the murder case?

364
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,500
Your Majesty.

365
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,990
The entrance of the secret passage

366
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,490
is at least a few decades old.

367
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,140
I believe they didn't do it.

368
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,430
Maybe there's some misunderstanding.

369
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,500
This secret passage has been here for a hundred years.

370
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,640
Where does the secret passage lead to?

371
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,680
Why are you hesitating?

372
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,550
Can't you say it?

373
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,460
It leads to the Pagoda of Bliss.

374
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,710
Is there really the Pagoda of Bliss?

375
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,100
Fang Duobing.

376
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,800
You are the son of Fang Zeshi.

377
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,980
You've been to the palace since you were young.

378
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,590
You should know the consequences of deceiving me.

379
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,770
Tell me.

380
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,660
Is there really the Pagoda of Bliss?

381
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,680
Yes.

382
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,900
What's in the Pagoda of Bliss?

383
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,080
A lot of treasures.

384
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,050
A lot of treasures,

385
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,420
but you came out empty-handed?

386
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,680
We are not thieves.

387
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,360
Then why did you take this strange vessel?

388
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,620
Tell me.

389
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,650
What's the origin of this strange vessel?

390
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,780
Lock them here for now.

391
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,860
Xuanyuan Xiao.

392
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,500
Come take a look with me.

393
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,280
If there really is the Pagoda of Bliss,

394
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,570
I can believe

395
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,540
what they said.

396
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,540
If not,

397
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,780
don't blame me for being ruthless.

398
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,520
Your Majesty.

399
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,550
You can't enter the secret passage.

400
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,420
Step aside.

401
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:51,910
Your Majesty.

402
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,780
At this point,

403
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,270
why didn't you tell His Majesty about the Karmic Bugs?

404
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,130
If we tell him about the Karmic Bugs,

405
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,450
we have to talk about the pagoda's 100-year-old secret.

406
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,130
We can't talk about that.

407
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,110
Even if we don't say it,

408
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,280
His Majesty saw it himself.

409
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,320
Your Majesty.

410
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,020
Bad news.

411
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,080
The Empress Dowager left the palace to burn incense.

412
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,020
But she was abducted.

413
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,260
It's my fault.

414
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,750
I'll bring the Empress Dowager back now.

415
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,800
Let's go.

416
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,530
Are you two responsible for that?

417
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,280
At a time like this,

418
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,600
if we can't explain, we should run.

419
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,980
The secret passage and the Pagoda of Bliss are all fake.

420
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,390
It's all your tricks.

421
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,140
Arrest them!

422
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,480
Get ready to retreat.

423
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,110
Stop! Stop!

424
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,670
After them!

425
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,250
The three of us have yet to find a worthy opponent

426

Your Highness, please forgive me.

433
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,920
So you really plan to rebel.

434
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,360
It's not too late to know now.

435
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,400
Lord Xuanyuan.

436
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,530
I struck you too hard.

437
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,960
My apologies.

438
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,130
Wipe your eyes and take a good look.

It merely screeched,

Why was he so angry

455
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,200
and wanted to arrest you two?

456
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,980
His Majesty has his own reason.

457
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,860
Your Highness, it's better not to ask.

458
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,090
Did those thieves steal things

459
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,460
and make Father misunderstand you?

460
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,460
This can't do.

461
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,050
I'll arrest all of them

462
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,090
and clear your name.

463
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,820
Your Highness, don't.

Wait for us to return

By the way,

509
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,740
I suddenly remembered

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,540
Okay.

514
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,020
When you're done,

515
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,210
we'll meet at the Lotus Tower.

516
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay.

517
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,600
I have to meet him

518
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,990
eventually.

519
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,200
[Live and work in peace]

520
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,170
[Tianji Mountain Manor]

521
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,870
Young Master.

522
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,060
Don't go near the manor.

523
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,590
It's surrounded by guards from the court.

524
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:43,940
Where is my mother?

525
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,180
Mother.

526
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,530
I caused trouble

527
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,460
and implicated Father.

528
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Xiaobao, get up.

529
00:27:59,530 --> 00:27:59,900
Come on.

530
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,460
Xiaobao.

531
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,100
Do you remember the character scroll hanging in your room?

532
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,900
Justice and Righteousness.

533
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,750
When you were three,

534
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,230
your father gave you that scroll,

535
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,590
hoping you could become

536
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,750
a man of integrity.

537
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,360
Right now, you're doing exactly that.

538
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
What fault do you have?

539
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,770
Your father won't blame you.

540
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,940
But the Imperial City Division took Father away.

541
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,070
I don't know what Shan Gudao will do to him.

542
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,050
Mother.

543
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,560
Please contact the elders of the court and the princes

544
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,050
and ask them to put in a good word for Father.

545
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,210
I'll send some men who haven't been seen before to wait outside the city.

546
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,010
If anything bad happens,

547
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,460
we'll have to find the chance and break him out of prison.

548
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,590
If that happens,

549
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,460
your father will live the rest of his life

550
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,110
as a runaway rebel.

551
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,460
You know your father.

552
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,320
He'd rather die than become that.

553
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,700
I won't take the risk

554
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,170
unless I absolutely have to.

555
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,180
I can't let anything

556
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,240
happen to my father.

557
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,310
You really came.

558
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,030
Sect Leader.

559
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,670
It's really you.

560
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,240
I invited you here

561
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,930
to ask about the whereabouts

562
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,930
of Jiao Liqiao's lair.

563
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,720
Sorry.

564
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,360
My hands haven't been steady lately.

565
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,790
So I can't pour you tea.

566
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,550
I'm the one who should be sorry.

567
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,460
Let bygones be bygones.

568
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm not talking about the past.

569
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,540
I'm sorry about the present.

570
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,920
Li Lianhua.

571
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,440
Sect Leader Xiao.

572
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,900
Sect Leader Xiao.

573
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,980
Please give the order

574
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,700
for all members of the Sigu Sect to look for Li Lianhua.

575
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,370
What happened to Li Lianhua?

576
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,430
There's only blood left in the Lotus Tower.

577
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,700
Li Lianhua is missing.

578
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,760
Mr. Fang,

579
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,870
dozens of people in the martial world

580
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,020
disappear every day.

581
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,700
Why should the entire Sigu Sect be deployed

582
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,220
to look for Li Lianhua?

583
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,060
The Sigu Sect attends to serious matters.

584
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,880
It's not for looking for random people.

585
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,440
Finding Li Lianhua is the most serious matter.

586
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,180
Only Li Lianhua

587
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,140
can stop Shan Gudao's diabolical plan.

588
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,040
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

589
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,850
Quit exaggerating.

590
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,010
There are indeed rumors in the martial world that

591
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,900
Shan Gudao faked his death

592
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,370
and attacked Tianji Hall with the Wansheng Clan.

593
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,620
But this is your personal grudges.

594
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,660
It has nothing to do with the world's safety.

595
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,650
Sect Leader Xiao.

596
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,420
I don't know if you're really dumb

597
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
or just pretending to be.

598
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,180
In his ten years of hiding,

599
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,540
Shan Gudao led the Wansheng Clan,

600
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,540
joined forces with Jiao Liqiao,

601
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,070
and recruited many evil and skilled martial artists.

602
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,140
His power has already surpassed the authorities.

603
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,380
Not just that,

604
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,010
he has also acquired the mother Karmic Bug.

605
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,680
With time,

606
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,340
he can control anyone to be his puppet.

607
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,650
Do you still think you can mind your own business?

608
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,480
I swear to heaven and earth

609
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,260
that I am telling the truth.

610
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,390
Everyone.

611
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,620
Only by finding Li Lianhua

612
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,540
can we stop Shan Gudao.

613
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,500
How will finding Li Lianhua

614
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,060
stop Shan Gudao?

615
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,670
Do they know each other?

616
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,700
Because Li Lianhua is his junior

617
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,450
and the leader of the Sigu Sect,

618
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,360
Li Xiangyi.

619
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,240
Are you telling the truth?

620
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,400
Li Lianhua is really the Sect Leader?

621
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,420
Nonsense!

622
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,410
Li Xiangyi was such a magnificent figure.

623
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,010
Meanwhile, Li Lianhua is just

624
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,280
a village man and a farmer.

625
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,210
Master Shi.

626
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,700
In this world,

627
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,130
apart from Fang Duobing,

628
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,730
who else can prove that

629
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,160
Li Lianhua is Li Xiangyi?

630
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,000
I'll prove it for him.

631
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,150
Zhan Yun Fei, Master Zhan.

632
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,560
I have a way to prove it right here.

633
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,660
This is...

634
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,440
Yangzhouman?

635
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,550
Fang Duobing.

636
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,500
Your inner power is Yangzhouman?

637
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,700
Back then, I was seriously injured

638
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,490
and my life was at risk.

639
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,150
So, Li Lianhua taught me Yangzhouman.

640
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,140
Is he really alive?

641
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,020
Sect Leader is in danger,

642
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,130
we should find him immediately.

643
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,810
Even if it’s Li Xiangyi,

644
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,060
so what?

645
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,190
Sigu Sect is built to uphold justice in the martial world.

646
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,870
It deals with serious matters of the martial world.

647
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,400
If we dispatch the entire sect

648
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,260
to look for a single person,

649
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:29,900
we'll surely become a laughing stock

650
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,170
if the word gets out.

651
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,179
We will indeed become a laughing stock.

652
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,790
They'll laugh at us for being hypocrites.

653
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,100
Mian.

654
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,230
I didn't expect

655
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,469
you would become like this.

656
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,580
You talk about benevolence and righteousness,

657
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,340
but your heart is filled with jealousy and ill intentions.

658
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,530
You talk about the risk of

659
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,940
tending to small matters instead of big ones.

660
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,040
But the concept of justice in this world

661
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,190
is the accumulation of these small matters.

662
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,290
What if the person

663
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,880
who disappeared today was a mere merchant?

664
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,010
Will we leave him to his demise

665
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,250
just because he's not significant enough for us to care?

666
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,820
The world doesn't need

667
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,940
this kind of Sigu Sect.

668
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,270
Besides,

669
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,730
I knew

670
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,730
all this is just your excuse.

671
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,880
Pass the order of the Sigu Sect Leader.

672
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,200
From today onwards, everyone in the Sigu Sect

673
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,810
must look for Li Lianhua.

674
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,000
No matter how far and wide,

675
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,960
we must not miss a corner.

676
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,380
The Sigu Sect also invites all righteous allies

677
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,090
to come together and discuss our strategy against the Wansheng Clan.

678
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,510
Yes, Sect Leader.

679
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,830
Yes, Sect Leader.

680
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,750
I regret it so much.

681
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,300
I shouldn't have let you

682
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,600
be the leader of the Sigu Sect.

683
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,050
I'll be taking the Leader's Token.

684
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,480
Leaving it with you

685
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,030
is a humiliation to the Sigu Sect.

686
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,130
Farewell.

687
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,200
Is he dead?

688
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,560
[Yu Die, Qing Shu]

689
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,300
He has been here for four to five days.

690
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,780
He hasn't woken up at all.

691
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,620
Master gave him the best medicine.

692
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,150
We gave him so many expensive medicines

693
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,940
for his inner injuries.

694
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,070
He's still alive,

695
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,570
and the wound hasn't worsened.

696
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,550
But he just wouldn't wake up.

697
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,100
After all, he hurt his ribs and his lungs.

698
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,660
Anyone would take a long time to heal.

699
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,800
Why did Master save him?

700
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
I've been with Master for three years.

701
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,510
I've only seen Master kill people.

702
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,940
But I've never seen Master save people.

703
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,590
Could he be...

704
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,200
Be what?

705
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,970
The Master's beloved.

706
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,060
The Master's beloved lives there.

707
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,550
That is the one Master likes.

708
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,910
That person has been there for so long.

709
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,980
He's completely silent.

710
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,310
-Who is he, anyway?
-Quit asking.

711
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:15,550
Why are you talking so much?

712
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,770
Master might kill you if you're not careful.

713
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,350
Let's go.

714
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,690
It's Jiao Liqiao's lair.

715
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,450
If I had ended up like this back then,

716
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,710
I would have taken my own life already.

717
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,820
I wouldn't have given Jiao Liqiao

718
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,140
the chance to humiliate me.

719
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,900
Perhaps, if it were back then,

720
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,970
Li Xiangyi would have killed Biqiu

721
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,450
the moment he stabbed him.

722
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,620
Fortunately, times have changed.

723
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,280
He's awake. Let's stop.

724
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,180
You lost today.

725
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,550
You've been sleeping for a long time.

726
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,870
If you slept for another day,

727
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,470
we'd bury you like a corpse.

728
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,980
Are you blind?

729
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,620
My eyes

730
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,620
are indeed damaged.

731
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,640
So we're guarding a blind man.

732
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,420
He's a good-looking one.

733
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,050
The ones we guarded

734
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,420
had their eyes dug out by Master.

735
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,380
They were so ugly.

736
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,510
Blind man.

737
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,860
It's fine if you can't see.

738
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,290
Just don't bother us with anything.

739
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,010
Don't worry.

740
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,620
I'm a very obedient blind man.

741
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,820
So...

742
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,880
Where am I?

743
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,320
I won't tell you.

744
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,410
You won't tell me?

745
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,290
Then let me guess.

746
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,710
This should be a dungeon.

747
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,680
You're wearing chains on your arms and legs.

748
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,350
Where else could this be?

749
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,270
Then your master must be Jiao Liqiao.

750
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,040
You're pretty smart.

751
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,870
The two of you have nice voices.

752
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,110
If I'm not wrong,

753
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,740
you should be Nanyin's descendents.

754
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,970
Just like your master,

755
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,990
right?

756
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,400
You're a sweet talker.

757
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,470
We are very busy.

758
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,130
Call us if you're dying.

759
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,660
If you're not dead, go back to sleep.

760
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,300
Give me a cup of tea.

761
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,820
Tea?

762
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,760
Didn't I tell you not to bother us?

763
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,110
I don't want to bother you either.

764
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,850
But I'm really thirsty.

765
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,370
If I die from thirst,

766
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,010
won't it be more trouble for you?

767
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,800
If you're thirsty and want water,

768
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,850
you can kneel down and beg me.

769
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:58,050
I will let you drink some water.

770
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,430
You already have the Karmic Bug.

771
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,490
Why are you here

772
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,150
instead of executing your big plan?

773
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,770
I've worked hard for over ten years.

774
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,590
Of course I have to see

775
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,900
your pathetic defeated state.

776
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,830
The best in the world,

777
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,710
the invincible Li Xiangyi,

778
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,870
has finally lost to me.

779
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,810
If I knew you wanted to win this badly,

780
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,340
I would have slacked off back then

781
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,810
and let you win.

782
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,460
Then, you wouldn't have to waste

783
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,540
ten years of your life like this.

784
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,400
Li Xiangyi.

785
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,580
Don’t be so full of yourself.

786
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,100
So what if you're good at martial arts?

787
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,960
So what if you're smart and strategic?

788
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,950
At the peak of your life,

789
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,970
you were just the leader of the Sigu Sect.

790
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,680
As for me,

791
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,260
I am more than ten times better than you.

792
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,970
Now that

793
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,310
the Karmic Bug is in my hands,

794
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,530
everything is under my control.

795
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,660
My great cause will be achieved in a few days.

796
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,450
My Wansheng Clan will be the best in the martial world,

797
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,210
and I shall rule the world.

798
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,900
As for you,

799
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,830
I will hang you on the city wall

800
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,360
to endure the harsh weather

801
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,800
and suffer every day.

802
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,090
No one will remember who you are.

803
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,860
And when they think of you,

804
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,980
they will only remember that wild mutt at the city gate.

805
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,530
And even when you want a cup of water,

806
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:44,970
you have to kneel down

807
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,570
and beg for it.

808
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
Oh... Shan Gudao.

809
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,980
It doesn't matter if I don't drink the water.

810
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,960
But after so many years,

811
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,340
you still get angry so easily.

812
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,640
You won't be happy for long.

813
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,420
Enjoy your suffering.

814
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,540
Take care.

815
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,310
You two keep an eye on him.

816
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,460
Torture him every day,

817
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,330
but don't kill him.

818
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,900
He must witness my day of glorious success.

819
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,560
How dare you order us around?

820
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,590
I don't think you'll be happy for long either.

821
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,780
Flowers will blossom again.

822
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,620
But a man can never be young again.

823
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,820
Seek not eternal wealth.

824
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,850
You only need to be content.

825
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,240
Mr. Fang.

826
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,240
I read these letters during the day.

827
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,830
There's no news of Physician Li.

828
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,580
Any news

829
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,280
from the masters?

830
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,430
[Li Lianhua]

831
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,590
Li Lianhua!

832
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,110
Stop!

833
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,540
Who are you?
