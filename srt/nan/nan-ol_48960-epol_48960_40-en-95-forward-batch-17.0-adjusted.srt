I know you're going to Sigu Sect.

Have you really made up your mind?

9
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,140
There are some things that I have to solve myself.

10
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,700
I have to end them myself too.

Have you heard?

20
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,130
The leader of the Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi, is not dead.

21
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:24,940
Really?

22
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,520
Yes.

23

The traitor, Yun Biqiu,

24
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,390
conspired with Jiao Liqiao repeatedly

25
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,180
and almost overturned the whole martial world.

26
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,610
Fortunately, the Sigu Sect leader,

27
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,529
Li Xiangyi, resurfaced the martial world

28

and curbed the chaos.

29
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,600
I heard that the Sigu Sect is going to interrogate the traitor, Yun Biqiu.

37
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,400
and sent them out of Baichuan Court.

38
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,030
A kind of concealing potion was used on these letters.

39
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,840
With them, you leaked out everything

40
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,190
pertaining to the location and layout

41
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,440
of Baichuan Court's 188 prisons.

Biqiu. Oh, Biqiu...

44
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,630
Ten years ago, you were bewitched by Jiao Liqiao's beauty.

45
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,600
All these years,

46
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,409
you stayed at home and refused to travel,

47
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,260
as if you were punishing yourself.

48
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,610
I really thought that you'd grounded yourself

49
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,630
to repent your mistake.

50
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,780
Who would have thought that,

51
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,830
after ten years,

52
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,640
you are still so stubborn?

53
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,740
You even harmed the Sect Leader

54
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,320
again for that witch.

55
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,000
Baichuan Court is known as the martial world's court of justice.

56
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,020
It has brought countless villains to justice in the past years.

57
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,100
But if there is a traitor among Fo, Bi, Bai, and Shi,

58
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,150
who will harm the martial world,

59
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,760
then who will uphold justice in the martial world?

64
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,700

69
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
Kill him!

Yun Biqiu is one of the four masters of the Baichuan Court.

71
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,150
He harmed the martial world

72
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,290
and betrayed his duties.

73
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,720
He tried to kill the Sect Leader many times.

74
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,700
It's unforgivable.

75
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,420
Baichuan Court has always been strict with punishments.

76
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,430
We never make exceptions.

77

Yun Biqiu is expelled from the Baichuan Court.

79

As for the murder he committed,

80
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,120
he will pay with his life.

81

Yun Biqiu.

83
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,150
You can only blame yourself

84

for ending up like this.

85
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,170

Stand up, everyone.

101
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,720
I'm no longer the leader of the Sigu Sect.

102
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,110
You'll always be our leader.

103
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,930
We'll follow you to the death!

104
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
Is this what you wanted to see?

105

106
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,890
Tell everyone to get up.

107
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,750
Biqiu.

108
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,590
Since I'm not dead,

109
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,990
why must you be so stubborn?

110
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,150
Sect Leader.

111
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,200
I've let you down.

112
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,900
I poisoned you back then

113
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,450
and severely wounded you recently.

114
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,800
I am too ashamed to live on.

115
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,980
What about the good things you did?

116
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,980
Why didn't you mention them?

117
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,840
You defamed yourself

118
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,770
and used the map of the 188 prisons as bait

119
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,720
to earn Jiao Liqiao's trust.

120
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
You found the details of her defenses

121
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,190
and deliberately disclosed them to Fang Duobing.

122
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,460
That's how everyone was able to find and save me that day.

123
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,730
It was also you

124
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,930
who pretended to be bewitched by her beauty

125
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,840
and made Jiao Liqiao let her guard down.

126
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,950
You induced her to make flawed mechanisms

127
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,180
and destroyed half of Shan Gudao's foundation.

128
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,840
Am I right?

129
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,460
Sect Leader,

130
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,010
are you telling the truth?

131
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,220
Everyone,

132
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,990
these are the mechanism blueprints

133
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,700
found in Jiao Liqiao's hideout.

134
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,980
They are all written by Yun Biqiu.

135
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,750
You can verify them.

136
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,180
Anyone who knows how to design mechanisms

137
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,040
can tell what Yun Biqiu did to them.

138
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,750
When I saw the layout of the statues on the roofs,

139
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I knew something was weird about them.

140
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,550
All the traps we encountered along the way

141
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,590
had their mechanisms exposed.

142
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,580
It was very obvious.

143
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,460
Any designer would know that

144
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,980
the mechanism should be hidden.

145
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,980
And this mechanism...

146
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,340
Someone deliberately placed this mechanism here

147
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,770
for people to see.

148
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,060
He even buried 18 fire bombs around the court,

149
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,860
saving everyone from a bloody battle.

150
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,510
I see.

151
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,100
Biqiu.

152
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,870
You did all those things.

153
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,670
Why didn't you tell us about it?

154
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,310
Sect Leader was poisoned and fell into the sea because of me.

155
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,760
Later, he was also stabbed by me.

156
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,320
58 members of the Sigu Sect died because of me.

157
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,830
No matter what I do,

158
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,090
I cannot amend my sins.

159
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,030
Biqiu.

160
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,720
When you stabbed me that day,

161
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,240
you purposely missed the spot by half an inch.

162
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,340
You originally asked me out that day

163
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,620
to tell me this information.

164
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,740
But unexpectedly,

165
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,200
Jiao Liqiao had secretly sent someone to spy on you.

166
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm not talking about the past.

167
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm sorry

168
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,700
for the present.

169
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,770
Only by stabbing me can you get Jiao Liqiao

170
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,290
to lower her guard against you.

171
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,890
That way, she no longer doubted

172
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,420
the mechanisms you placed.

173
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,240
So,

174
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,430
you helped me find Jiao Liqiao's place,

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,350
and I was able to catch all of them at once.

176
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,600
What you did back then

177
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,520
was not your intention either.

178
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,580
Since you wish to repent,

179
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,490
we shall

180
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,610
let bygones be bygones.

181
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,700
Sect Leader.

182
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,620
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

183
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,240
Master Yun.

184
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,380
In order to clear your name,

185
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,150
that man named Li Xiangyi

186
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,340
had to come back from the bottom of the sea.

187
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,430
And that man called Li Lianhua

188
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,180
can no longer be

189
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,860
a carefree wandering physician anymore.

190
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,570
Sect Leader...

191
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,620
How is he?

192
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,860
It's Xueronghua.

193
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
What is Xueronghua?

194
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,910
It's Snow Master's dark skill.

195
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,760
Jiao Liqiao must have done it

196
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,920
to control Biqiu.

197
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,540
The only way

198
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,630
to detoxify the poison is

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,960
to circulate his blood with Snow Master's inner power.

200
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,540
Otherwise, the poison will reach his heart and kill him.

201
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,910
Jiao Liqiao and Snow Master are both dead.

202
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,650
Xueronghua is now a lost skill.

203
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,670
Then Biqiu...

204
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,550
He won't last long.

205
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,730
He knew that,

206
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,570
but he didn't stop me from killing Snow Master back then.

207
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,910
Xiaobao.

208
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,340
Does Tianji Hall have a secret branch in this vicinity?

209
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,950
Can you help me find a way

210
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,390
to cure the Xueronghua?

211
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,020
Okay.

212
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,370
I'll contact them now.

213
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:57,690
[Roam with a Noble Spirit]

214
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,310
The rest of you may leave too.

215
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,740
We'll plan after Biqiu wakes up.

216
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,400
It's not that I don't care about my life.

217
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,690
But Li Xiangyi said back then

218
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,020
that he would protect everyone in Sigu Sect.

219
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,640
And yet, 58 brothers died

220
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
in the East Sea battle.

221
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,770
If I let Sigu Sect lose another member now,

222
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,550
how will I face my fallen brothers

223
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,690
in the Netherworld?

224
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,280
At least my last bit of inner power

225
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,880
is useful in the end.

226
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,330
I really shouldn't have been wasteful

227
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,680
when I was young.

228
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,660
Then I wouldn't have had to

229
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,630
put my life on the line

230
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,450
just to do some good with my inner power.

231
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,960
Sect Leader.

232
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,530
You're awake.

233
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,610
Did you

234
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,740
cure the Xueronghua for me?

235
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,480
Do you

236
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,110
feel better?

237
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,420
I...

238
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,200
I...

239
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,060
Biqiu.

240
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,480
Back then, at the East Seaside,

241
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,270
I fought the Jinyuan Alliance alone.

242
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,960
I had no way out and no reinforcements.

243
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,250
I sank the ship with everything I had.

244
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,310
But the Bicha Poison struck

245
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,190
and I fell into the sea.

246
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,690
Back then,

247
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,290
I really hated you.

248
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,440
After I made my way out of the sea alive,

249
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,990
I swore

250
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,230
to take revenge

251
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,670
even if it would land me in hell.

252
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,940
I...

253
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,700
Deserve to die.

254
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,540
Actually,

255
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,990
after the battle at the East Sea,

256
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,000
I went back to Sigu Gate.

257
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,930
While in hiding,

258
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,420
I saw the sect crumble and fall apart.

259
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,060
I also heard

260
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,730
complaints I'd never heard of before.

261
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,000
I was confused

262
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,860
and lost my direction.

263
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,460
I thought about it for a long time.

264
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,360
Maybe that failure was caused by

265
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,210
my own stubbornness.

266
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:52,890
No.

267
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,660
It doesn't matter anymore.

268
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,730
I don't want to go back to Sigu Sect.

269
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,140
Let me tell you something funny.

270
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,600
Back then, I had no money on me,

271
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,250
[Pawn]

272
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,620
and I was injured.

273
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,940
So I pawned the only valuable

274
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,180
item on my body

275
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,030
for 50 taels of silver.

276
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,940
It was the Sigu Sect Leader token.

277
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,589
A token that could spare or take a life at will,

278
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,560
a token that everyone in the martial world

279
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,970
knew about.

280
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,310
Biqiu.

281
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,510
Don't you think it's funny?

282
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,410
Such a powerful token was only worth 50 taels.

283
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:40,810
At that time, I thought

284
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:43,250
I would redeem it

285
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,050
as soon as I was better.

286
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,590
But at one point in time,

287
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,840
I started growing turnips instead.

288
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,970
Growing turnips?

289
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,440
It's so that I won't starve anymore.

290
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,550
It was spring then.

291
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,910
I thought the turnips were growing too slowly.

292
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,090
I looked at them every day,

293
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,350
and counted them every day.

294
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,740
When I saw the turnip bellies

295
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,950
poking out of the soil,

296
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,420
I was so happy,

297
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,590
I almost cried.

298
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,310
Before I knew it,

299
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,240
I somehow saved up 50 taels of silver.

300
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,360
It had been three years

301
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,500
since I fell into the sea.

302
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,150
I took the 50 taels of silver to the pawnshop

303
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,260
to redeem the token.

304
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,570
In a poor fishing village,

305
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,680
no one knew what it was.

306
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,950
The token was still there, but I hesitated.

307
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,420
It turned out that I'd forgotten the martial world.

308
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,950
I no longer yearned to be the best

309
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,020
or to be admired by everyone.

310
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,640
I kept myself fed

311
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,500
and even kept a dog fed.

312
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,570
Such a life

313
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,190
was perfect.

314
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,180
When I thought of you one day,

315
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,180
I suddenly forgot why I hated you.

316
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,180
The past doesn't matter anymore.

317
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,420
Sect Leader.

318
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,750
If those are not important,

319
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,600
what is?

320
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,190
What matters is your future life.

321
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,410
You've always liked studying.

322
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,580
You can become a scholar,

323
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,910
or get married

324
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,380
and live a peaceful life.

325
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,550
Biqiu.

326
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,910
Live well.

327
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,900
Live for yourself.

328
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,820
Okay.

329
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,140
I'll listen to you.

330
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,780
I'll live well.

331
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,830
What about you?

332
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,010
What about your Bicha Poison?

333
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,550
Don't worry.

334
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,980
I can even cure your Xueronghua.

335
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,590
Let alone

336
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,260
a mere Bicha Poison.

337
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,990
[Grand Hall]

338
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,030
Li Lianhua!

339
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,320
What's wrong with you?

340
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,100
You saved Yun Biqiu with Yangzhouman?

341
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,350
You truly hold no grudge

342
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,260

Draw your sword.

512
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,710
I'm going to fight you to death today.

513
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,720
It's been ten years.

514
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,960
Let me see your Shaoshi Sword again.

515
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,620
Li Xiangyi may be dead,

516
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,930
but his sword is still alive.

517
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,620
It's easy to conquer the world,

518
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,350
but it's not easy to stop using Xiangyi Swordplay.

519
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,040
It's not that easy

520
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,010
to be a dead person too.

521
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,920
I don't have much inner power left.

522
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,010
I'm no match for you.

523
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,880
I'd rather kill myself.

524
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,440
It's not appropriate for you to kill me.

525
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,500
You...

526
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,350
Some people will admit defeat easily

527
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,770
but some will never.

528
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,240
Everybody's faith

529
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,300
is ultimately different.

530
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,620
What are you talking about?

531
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,929
I have let many things down in my life,

532
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,300
but I'm most sorry

533
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,110
to Shaoshi Sword.

534
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,139
Zijin.

535
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,550
Now that Shaoshi Sword is broken,

536
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,389
there will be no more Li Xiangyi in this world,

537
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,190
nor will there be Xiangyi Swordplay.

538
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,429
You can rest assured.

539
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,489
As for Mian,

540
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,290
it's your suspicion and lack of trust

541
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,150
that disappointed her.

542
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,780
There's nothing I can do.

543
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,900
Don't do things like this

544
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,150
in the future.

545
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,290
Sect Leader!

546
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,070
Li Xiangyi!

547
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,050
Guess what?

548
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,580
This Li Lianhua from Lotus Tower

549
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,690
who can cure the dead

550
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,920
is actually the one who challenged

551
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,430
the entire battleship of Jinyuan Alliance alone ten years ago,

552
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,250
the Sect Leader of Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi.

553
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,330
Li Xiangyi?

554
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,310
Li Xiangyi came back from his death under the sea,

555
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,130
and lay in wait for more than ten years,

556
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,560
just to foil the schemes

557
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,860
between Wansheng Clan and Nanyin.

558
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,230
With his white cape behind him,

559
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,530
[Discussing the past and present]

560
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,350
he reappeared in the martial arts world with Shaoshi Sword in hand,

561
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,900
and held the leader of Wansheng Clan at swordpoint.

562
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,760
Bravo! Bravo!

563
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,230
What happened after that?

564
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,860
Go on.

565
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,540
Go on.

566
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,530
Tomorrow is the day.

567
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,460
Fox Spirit,

568
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,780
do you think he will come?

569
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,920
Did this Li Xiangyi not come

570
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,070
because he's afraid?

571
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Who is this Li Xiangyi?

572
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,920
I think this is his deliberate tactic used

573
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,220
to mess with Di Feisheng's emotions.

574
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,860
Sect Leader, do you think something has happened?

575
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,910
Excuse me, may I know who is Di Feisheng,

576
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,070
and who is Fang Duobing?

577
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,000
I am.

578
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,770
Someone asked me to deliver a letter today.

579
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,840
Sir, where are you going?

580
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,730
Where am I going?

581
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,760
Let me think.

582
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,400
If the boat sinks and I spend the rest of my life here,

583
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,690
that doesn't seem so bad either.

584
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,520
Ten years ago,

585
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,820
at the Great Battle of the East Sea,

586
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,150
I couldn't win even though

587
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,470
I had the weaponry advantage and used the sinking of the boat.

588
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,070
Your valiance

589
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,880
is rare in the world.

590
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,800
I sincerely admire you.

591
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,170
It's been years now,

592
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,990
I am ill of health,

593
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,350
my sword is broken, and I will be gone.

594
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,450
It is with great regret that I can't attend

595
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,170
the promised meeting at the East Sea.

596
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,570
I'm grateful for the Styx Flower you gave me,

597
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,360
but I have failed you ultimately.

598
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,640
Years have passed

599
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,200
and things have changed.

600
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,990
When it's time to go, it goes.

601
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,070
When time comes, it comes.

602
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,880
I have passed my skills to Fang Duobing.

603
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,380
He is talented,

604
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,880
and no doubt

605
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,490
will surpass me one day.

606
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,690
You have no intention of chasing victory,

607
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,370
you just want to reach the peak.

608
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,260
Now that I'm gone,

609
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,870
if you are unwilling to accept this,

610
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,190
please ask Fang Duobing to stand in my place.

611
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,410
Last regards, Li Xiangyi.

612
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,500
His sword is broken and he is gone?

613
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,410
Li Lianhua.

614
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
What does he mean?

615
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,360
He was fine, why would his sword break?

616
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,260
Is Li Xiangyi really not coming?

617
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,910
He sent his last regards.

618
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,720
Li Lianhua's Bicha Poison

619
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,890
never had a cure.

620
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,140
How could this happen?

621
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,320
Then could he really be…

622
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,730
He told me

623
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,520
he had a way to cure the Bicha Poison.

624
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:09,880
But...

625
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,570
I should have known.

626
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,270
I really misunderstood him.

627
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,440
So it's true.

628
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,670
But how is that possible?

629
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,020
He survived it.

630
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,050
How could he have died?

631
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,480
He was fine

632
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,910
the day his sword broke.

633
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,220
The day his sword broke?

634
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,220
When did you see him?

635
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,900
A few days ago,

636
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,460
at Wangjiang Pavilion.

637
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,550
I forced him to draw his sword and fight me.

638
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,690
He then broke Shaoshi Sword

639
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,590
and jumped into the river.

640
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,380
Was he trying to–

641
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,740
He never cared about the position of sect leader at all.

642
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,420
Why didn't you trust him?

643
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,330
It's all our fault.

644
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,180
We didn't even notice.

645
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,520
We thought he was fine.

646
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,000
Miss Shi.

647
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,600
Since Li can supress

648
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,780
the poison in his body for ten years,

649
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,080
he might be able to do it for another ten years,

650
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,850
and another ten more.

651
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,420
I'll go find him now.

652
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,410
I'm afraid it's too late.

653
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,060
I've checked his pulse.

654
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,780
He only has less than a month to live.

655
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,360
He used his martial arts

656
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,520
too often for the Shan Gudao incident.

657
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,400
If he didn't take the Styx Flower in time,

658
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,880
I'm afraid by the time he wrote this letter he would have...

659
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,470
Impossible.

660
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,030
Li Lianhua is not dead.

661
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,010
No matter what you say,

662
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,980
as long as we don't find his body,

663
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,980
I won't believe that he is dead.

664
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,810
I will find him,

665
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,730
no matter what it takes.

666
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,190
Xiaobao.

667
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,580
Li Xiangyi.

668
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,570
No one can replace you

669
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,200
in our promise.
