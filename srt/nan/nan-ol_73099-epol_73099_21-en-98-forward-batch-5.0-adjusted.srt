[Episode 21]

3
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,560
Something's wrong.

4
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,450
What happened?

5
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,200
When I arrived at Jingyun Sect,

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,640
Xuan Wei and the others had returned.

7
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,310
They activated the protection formation,

8
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,430
trapping Long Yuan and the immortal troops

9
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,200
inside.

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,790
The formation seems to have been
created by Divine Lord Siling.

11
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,200
It's incredibly powerful.

12
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,120
Even Long Yuan can't break through it.

13
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,870
Moreover,

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,889
that formation
also weakens one's power.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,520
That…

16
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,240
If this goes on much longer,

17
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm afraid Long Yuan's power
will be completely drained.

18
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,660
How could this happen?

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,970
I only know medicine, not formations.

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,290
I'll stay to watch over Master.

21
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,470
You go gather people
to break the formation and save Long Yuan.

22
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,150
Well...

23
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,610
Master is now unconscious.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,570
We can't let anything happen to Long Yuan.

25
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,430
We're willing to go with you.

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,280
Alright.

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,490
Let's go.

28
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,190
Indeed.

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,870
What kind of evil spirit would dare
to kill Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

30
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,800
You should know,

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,240
in all the Nine Heavens,
Three Realms, and Six Paths,

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,140
the only one who dares to kill you,

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
wants to kill you,

34
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,710
and can kill you

35
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,560
is me.

36
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,960
Over the past six years,

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,760
anyone who showed me kindness
died a tragic death.

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,880
So this is what you call
the suffering of the mortal realm?

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,770
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,
you sure are fragile.

40
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,800
This is just the way of the mortal realm,
not even real suffering.

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,030
If you hate me this much,
why not just kill me?

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,160
Why lower yourself

43
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,150
to play along with me for six years?

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,750
I tried to kill you directly,

45
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,079
but you're too powerful.

46
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,870
I couldn't do it.

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,870
So I had to trap
your primordial spirit here…

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,130
and cheat you out of
your Life-Protecting Pearl.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,079
Only then could I make a move.

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
There were no six years.

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,680
It was only six days.

52
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,850
It was really hard for me
to spend six days with you

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,600
despite my disgust.

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,390
Six days?

55
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,120
This is an illusion?

56
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
That's right.

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,960
This is just an illusion,

58
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,000
one I especially crafted for you.

59
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,520
What's wrong?

60
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,880
Don't tell me you actually fell for me.

61
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,190
If so, you must be heartbroken.

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
Everything here is fake.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,620
The sun, the moon, and the stars are fake.

64
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,870
The buildings are fake.

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,600
Even the crowds of people

66
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,720
are fake too.

67
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,800
In this place,

68
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,040
the only real thing
is my desire to kill you.

69
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,980
No wonder when I said I saw Zhang Suan,

70
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,550
you told me that was impossible.

71
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,870
Turns out everything here is your setup.

72
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,000
Lin Fan, Scholar Kong,

73
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,440
even the old man at the flatbread shop—

74
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,200
they were all part of your plan
to lure me in.

75
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,710
You hate me so much.

76
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,360
You don't just want me dead.

77
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,630
You want me to suffer.

78
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,690
But the pain you've endured

79
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,430
isn't even a fraction

80
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,230
of what I went through back then.

81
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,520
How did I make you suffer?

82
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,920
Life is hard for everyone,
but even more so for women,

83
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,230
especially those
without family to protect them.

84
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,070
They're like candlelight in the dark,
faint and fragile,

85
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,560
drawing wolves from every direction.

86
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,690
Shi Hua was you.

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,270
You finally get it.

88
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,870
Shi Hua…

89
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,220
means "is Hua."

90
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,280
That was your past self.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
Haven't you always asked me

92
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,920
what happened during those ten years

93
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,320
when my power was sealed?

94
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,680
I've been telling you all along.

95
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
You just didn't understand.

96
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,240
This whole illusion is your trap for me.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,060
What about Lin Tao?

98
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,690
He was fake too?

99
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,720
Haven't you guessed?

100
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,270
You and I…

101
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,360
we once had a child.

102
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,840
I knew giving up without a fight
wasn't your style.

103
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,220
That day, you let yourself get caught

104
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
because you heard me say
we found His Lordship

105
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
and he was unconscious, right?

106
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,440
Ling'er,

107
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,330
even now, you still want
to go after His Lordship?

108
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,790
The Divine Lord destroyed
her physical body because of Bai Jiusi.

109
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,320
This is the perfect chance.

110
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,480
I must make him feel what it's like

111
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,790
to have only his primordial spirit left.

112
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,240
You...

113
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,650
Siling has really messed with your mind.

114
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,670
We've chosen our sides.
No need to say more.

115
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,390
Are you really going to protect him?

116
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,120
Ling'er,

117
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,390
the Heavenly Lord is my master,

118
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,200
and you're my daughter.

119
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,130
Don't put me on the spot, will you?

120
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,380
On the spot?

121
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,720
When have you ever been on the spot?

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,200
You never chose me anyway.

123
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll say it one last time—

124
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,080
step away.

125
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,490
Then you'll have to kill me first.

126
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,470
You think I don't dare?

127
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,840
A child...

128
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,720
We had a child?

129
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,710
No.

130
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
That's not possible.

131
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
You're lying, right?

132
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
Bai Jiusi,

133
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,480
you should be thanking me.

134
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,720
You didn't deserve to see Shi'an,

135
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,720
let alone hear him call you Dad.

136
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
But I relented.

137
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,680
I wanted to fulfill his wish
in this illusion.

138
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,440
No.

139
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,840
Impossible.

140
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,100
You must be lying to me.

141
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,000
You just want to hurt me.

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
You just want me dead.

143
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,670
You're lying, aren't you?

144
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,130
You're lying, aren't you?

145
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,710
Tell me you're lying!

146
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,030
You're so cold-hearted.

147
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,320
Can you even feel pain?

148
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,000
You…

149
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,960
Time's up.

150
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,910
Bai Jiusi.

151
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,570
It's time for you to die.

152
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,320
Immortal Lords.

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,930
Give me the Hanlin Dagger, please.

154
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,750
I'll tell them
this is all a misunderstanding.

155
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,000
Stop fooling around.

156
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm begging you. Be a good girl.

157
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,450
Give it to me.

158
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,600
Are you out of your mind?

159
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,670
This…

160
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,570
What happened to His Lordship?

161
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Tell me.

162
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,440
We once had a child?

163
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,080
What happened?

164
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,720
It was you!

165
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,200
You killed him.

166
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,360
Bai Jiusi.

167
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,150
Let's die together.

168
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,270
This stone tablet was glowing dimly,

169
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,030
so I let you come in to take a look.

170
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,480
Why did you break it
the moment you touched it?

171
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,280
I just pulled it out, that's all.

172
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,120
I don't know why it broke.

173
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,270
Nonsense.

174
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,480
I pounded on it so many times
and couldn't break it.

175
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,540
You must have used spiritual energy.

176
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,160
I didn't do anything.

177
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,980
Senior Shangguan!

178
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,960
Senior.

179
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,160
Shut up.

180
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,070
If you stop me from saving Master again,

181
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,200
I'll beat you up too.

182
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,120
What do you want? Don't come any closer.

183
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,510
I'm Grandmaster's most beloved disciple.

184
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,550
If you dare to hurt me,

185
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,410
she'll surely tear you to pieces!

186
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,920
Senior.

187
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,720
Senior.

188
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,840
Senior Meng!

189
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,550
I'm the head disciple of Jingyun Sect.

190
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,340
My parents died when I was little.

191
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,530
I joined the sect at five

192
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,070
and trained under the Sect Leader.

193
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,200
Thanks to the sect's guidance,

194
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,680
I found the right path to cultivation.

195
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,790
I'm your senior.

196
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,200
I've received more
than any of you ever have.

197
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,880
If anyone's going to die,

198
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,680
it should be me first.

199
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,960
Long Yuan,
with that weak magic of yours,

200
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,440
you're barely tickling me.

201
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
You asked for it.

202
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,830
Senior!

203
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Senior!

204
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,160
Senior!

205
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,750
Senior, that's enough.

206
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,910
Take him away.

207
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,310
Senior!

208
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
Be they mortal

209
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,160
or immortal,

210
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
anyone who messes with us

211
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,510
must die!

212
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,490
[Temple of the Primordial God]

213
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,480
I told you,

214
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,160
you're not allowed in.

215
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,070
Senior!

216
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,150
[Temple of the Primordial God]

217
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,200
You younger ones
may not be great at magic,

218
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,060
but you sure know
how to get under people's skin.

219
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,270
-No!
-Stop, Long Yuan!

220
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,270
Grandmaster.

221
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,400
Siling!

222
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,200
Get lost.

223
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,240
Senior Zhang.

224
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,880
What happened?

225
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,400
Those from Canglei Palace did it?

226
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
Yes. Fortunately, Grandmaster returned

227
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,590
and drove off Long Yuan and the others.

228
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,390
Grandmaster?

229
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,840
You mean Qingyue returned?

230
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,920
Watch your tongue, Senior Zhang.
You can't call Grandmaster by name.

231
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,650
Where is she?

232
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,790
Senior Meng Chu is severely injured.

233
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,070
Grandmaster is healing him.

234
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,750
They should be in the disciples' quarters.

235
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,280
Alright.

236
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,480
You…

237
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,740
I have to say Long Yuan is quite powerful.

238
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,700
He's wounded you so badly.

239
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,200
Don't use magic for now.

240
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,920
Focus on your recovery.

241
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,200
Thank you, Grandmaster.

242
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,530
You're injured. No need for formalities.

243
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,920
Have they all returned?

244
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,240
They're all waiting outside the hall.

245
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,690
Master, Grandmaster is here.

246
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
Welcome back, Grandmaster.

247
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,480
Master, your safe return

248
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,790
is a blessing to Jingyun Sect.

249
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,750
What a pity.

250
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,440
We missed the chance to kill Bai Jiusi.

251
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,830
We'll get another chance.

252
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,480
After a few rounds,

253
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,110
it turns out
Canglei Palace isn't so tough.

254
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,350
With Grandmaster here,

255
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,070
I believe we'll succeed soon.

256
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,510
Master, what's your plan

257
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,880
for dealing with Canglei Palace?

258
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,160
You've all worked hard these years.

259
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,090
I wouldn't have made it back safely

260
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,610
without your efforts.

261
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,440
This battle has damaged
Bai Jiusi's spiritual energy

262
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,640
and weakened him.

263
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,070
But Canglei Palace will no doubt
tighten their defenses.

264
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,070
We must remain alert
and guard the mountain gate well.

265
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,880
Please see to it yourselves.

266
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,790
Yes, Grandmaster.

267
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,680
You may leave.

268
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes.

269
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,510
Master.

270
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,230
My Lord, you're back.

271
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:14,960
Master.

272
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,590
Your primordial spirit was separated
from your body for so long.

273
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,200
Are you feeling unwell?

274
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,510
Siling is cunning and vicious.

275
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,810
This time, she harmed your immortal body

276
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,770
and defied the immortals' authority.

277
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,460
We can't just let it slide!

278
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,820
Master, please give the order

279
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,470
to capture her and bring her to justice.

280
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,350
No one is to touch her.

281
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,930
I have my own plans for this matter.

282
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,480
All of you, leave.

283
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,110
Master!

284
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,400
Leave!

285
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,030
Come on, let's go.

286
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,640
Come on.

287
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,110
How is Master?

288
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,750
I wonder what kind of spell

289
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,410
that witch has cast on Master.

290
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,110
Master said no one is to touch her.

291
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,600
Don't act on your own.

292
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
You're back.

293
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Yes, Divine Lord.

294
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,590
I told you before to stay at Jingyun Sect.

295
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,790
Until I returned,

296
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,920
you weren't to look for me
or act on your own.

297
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,180
Why didn't you listen?

298
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,800
Please punish me, Divine Lord.

299
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,440
At first, I followed Zhang Suan

300
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,240
to Songhe County to look for you.

301
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,240
But then…

302
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,570
then my father tricked me into going back.

303
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,830
I didn't know your full plan,

304
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,720
but when I heard Canglei Palace

305
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,850
had found Bai Jiusi,

306
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,510
I thought I could take the chance

307
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,840
to get rid of him for you.

308
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,130
I'm not blaming you.

309
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,400
But working for me

310
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,440
means you're now Canglei Palace's enemy.

311
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,200
I told you to stay at Jingyun Sect

312
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,400
because people here could protect you.

313
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,970
Those around Bai Jiusi
are not ordinary people.

314
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,680
I'll take his life myself.

315
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,200
I know you meant well.

316
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,720
Just don't act on your own again.

317
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,960
Good thing you met your father this time.

318
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,200
If it had been someone else,

319
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,460
you might not have made it out unscathed.

320
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,860
Divine Lord,
you don't need to speak for him.

321
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,240
He only ever thinks about himself.

322
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,350
It's not my place to say too much
about you and your father.

323
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,310
Just remember—

324
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,200
don't risk yourself again.

325
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,070
Yes, Divine Lord.

326
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,800
Grandmaster,
Zhang Suan is here to see you.

327
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,400
I see. You may go.

328
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Go get some rest.

329
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,270
Yes.

330
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,270
I was just about to look for you too.

331
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,550
Are you Divine Lord Siling or Li Qingyue?

332
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,590
I'm both.

333
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,480
So those 11 years at Jingyun Sect…

334
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,410
It was all an act.

335
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,030
So you were pretending to care for me?

336
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,400
I don't need to explain

337
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,480
my actions to a disciple.

338
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,000
But since you've always been loyal,

339
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,270
I'll let your disrespect today slide.

340
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,200
You're quick

341
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,240
to call me loyal.

342
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,790
Doesn't that just mean

343
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,650
you know I'm not just loyal to you?

344
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,550
Loyal or not, it means nothing to me.

345
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,830
Last time in the Nine Heavens,

346
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,720
you came to Canglei Palace to save me.

347
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,070
I noticed your magic had greatly improved.

348
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,550
You could even
take two moves from Bai Jiusi.

349
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,350
Did something happen to you?

350
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,360
I met someone in the Nine Heavens.

351
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,070
Who?

352
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,110
Xingman.

353
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,920
Are you still mad at me?

354
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,760
Meng Chu still
hasn't come looking for you.

355
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,360
This proves he can't
bring himself to leave his sect.

356
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
In his heart,

357
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,280
Jingyun Sect means more than you do.

358
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,110
But he's just a man.

359
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,210
If you're that into him,

360
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,230
I'll go kidnap him for you

361
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,020
and lock him in your room.
How about that?

362
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,840
Enough already.

363
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,890
I'm counting to three.

364
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,710
If you don't get up,

365
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,340
don't blame me for getting rough.

366
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,190
One.

367
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,360
Two. Three.

368
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,760
You ingrate!

369
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,280
Raising you was a waste of time!

370
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,630
Xiao Jingshan?

371
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,030
You know him?

372
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,090
I never met him, but I've heard of him.

373
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,760
500 years ago,

374
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,800
he tried to destroy the Infinite Stele

375
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,460
and was captured by Bai Jiusi.

376
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,690
Later, the Heavenly Emissary
ordered him imprisoned.

377
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,320
He's dead now?

378
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,480
Yes.

379
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,210
I saw it with my own eyes.

380
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,130
I even made a tombstone for him.

381
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,630
You think something's off?

382
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,590
Not really.

383
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,030
It's good that
your foundation has been restored.

384
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,760
Just now, Ling'er told me

385
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,960
you two went to
Songhe County to look for me.

386
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,840
Was it you who broke the illusion

387
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,000
I set up there?

388
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,150
You mean…

389
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
the Great Wilderness Stele, right?

390
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,710
How do you know
it's the Great Wilderness Stele?

391
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,710
I read about it once

392
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,230
in a book in the library.

393
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,760
I must've casually

394
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,220
tossed that book in there.

395
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,440
If I remember right, it didn't mention
how to break the formation.

396
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,480
How did you do it?

397
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,850
I honestly don't know.

398
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,940
I just gave it a gentle tug.

399
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,560
It came out of the ground and shattered.

400
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,760
Bai Jiusi said

401
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,040
he saw you in Songhe County.

402
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,710
Do you remember that?

403
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,960
That's true.

404
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,960
I did see him there.

405
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,400
Before I could do anything,

406
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,230
he vanished.

407
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,440
The Stele could only be controlled
by the one who activated it.

408
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,000
Without my help, how did you get in?

409
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,710
Meng Chu!

410
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,280
Meng Chu, come out!

411
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,220
Meng Chu!

412
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
I told you to stop coming here.

413
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,140
Can't you understand?

414
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,440
If it weren't for Mr. Meng,

415
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,440
you think I'd bother to come to this dump?

416
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,280
Dump?

417
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,000
We're an immortal sect now.

418
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,630
Even a janitor here
could beat you to death.

419
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,880
Like we haven't fought before.

420
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,030
Don't act like I don't know

421
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,510
just how weak Jingyun Sect is.

422
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,190
Stop bragging here.

423
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,550
If you don't let me in,

424
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,280
I'll bring the entire Yinlian Sect
to crush your mountain gate.

425
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,150
Ridiculous.

426
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,230
Even Long Yuan couldn't get past our gate,

427
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,320
and you think you can?

428
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,280
Long Yuan?

429
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,230
Which no-name sect is he from?

430
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,230
You've never heard of Long Yuan?

431
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,000
Listen up.

432
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,070
He's the head disciple
of Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

433
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,070
With a flick of his finger,
he can level many cities.

434
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,920
Against me,

435
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,050
he couldn't last more than 30 minutes.

436
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,960
Scared now?

437
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,110
I was, until you said

438
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,110
that last part.

439
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,350
Grandmaster.

440
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,360
Zhang Suan!

441
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,480
I knew you were trustworthy.

442
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,350
You're here to pick me up, right?

443
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,070
I remember you.

444
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,590
You're that disciple I injured.

445
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,630
You know, I didn't mean to hurt you.

446
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,360
It was that scheming girl, Lyu Suguan,

447
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,820
who pulled you
in front of her to take the hit.

448
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,150
How are you? All healed up?

449
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,340
How about this?

450
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,760
Go pass a message to Meng Chu for me.

451
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,920
Have him wait for me at the mountain gate.

452
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,630
If you help me today,

453
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,440
you'll be my sidekick from now on.

454
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,320
In all 12 provinces of Han,

455
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,670
I'll have your back.

456
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,820
You can strut around wherever you go.

457
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,330
How do you plan to have my back?

458
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,800
You can do whatever you want.

459
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,760
"Do whatever you want."

460
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,360
Oh, right.

461
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,360
If anyone messes with you,
just give them my full name.

462
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,280
If they still dare to act up,

463
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,230
you come tell me.

464
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,070
I'll beat them to a pulp

465
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,880
and make them regret
being born in the 12 provinces of Han.

466
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,920
You sound really powerful.

467
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,840
Of course.

468
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,630
I'm the head of Yinlian Sect.

469
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,510
Have you heard of the Yinlian Sect?

470
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,070
No.

471
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,870
You never heard of Yinlian Sect?

472
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,440
No wonder you're stuck here

473
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,110
as a low-ranking disciple.

474
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,990
You can't even beat
someone as inept as Lyu Suguan.

475
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,480
But

476
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,920
your outfit today…

477
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,840
Never mind. Enough talking.

478
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,370
Just go find Mr. Meng for me.

479
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,070
Tell Meng Chu to come out and shut her up.

480
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,000
Junior, why are you in here?

481
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,880
Senior, this is Heart-Calming Decoction.

482
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,350
I added lovage
and schizonepeta for you.

483
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,710
It's great for replenishing qi and blood.

484
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,310
I made it especially for you.

485
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,450
Please, drink some.

486
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,400
No, Junior.

487
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,130
Men and women should keep their distance.

488
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,760
Besides, I'm getting changed.
This really isn't appropriate.

489
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,320
What do you mean "keep their distance"?

490
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,360
What's not appropriate?

491
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,620
We never used to mind such things as kids.

492
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Why are you suddenly concerned now?

493
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,540
You're just afraid

494
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,320
that demon girl of yours will mind.

495
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,550
Yes.

496
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,020
I am afraid Xingman will mind.

497
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,150
Junior, I already have someone I love.

498
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,750
Stop wasting your time on me.

499
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,280
There are so many
fine disciples in Jingyun Sect.

500
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,360
And if not here, look elsewhere.

501
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,850
You'll surely find the right one for you.

502
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,800
Why can't you get over me?

503
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,590
I don't care about anyone else.

504
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,230
Even if Heavenly Lord Dacheng were here,

505
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,630
he wouldn't catch my eye.

00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,480
In my heart,

507
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,320
there's only you.

508
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,660
If you won't accept me,

509
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,700
then I'll wait.

510
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,590
I can wait for thousands of years.

511
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,710
One day, you'll turn around.

512

Don't.

Senior.

Jiang Bian, you need something?

515
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,710
Yeah, Senior Meng.

516
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,880
That demon girl is here for you.

517
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,590
She's outside the mountain gate now,

518
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,760
yelling her lungs out.

519
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,150
She's been yelling for four whole hours.

520
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,440
Even Grandmaster has been disturbed.

521
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,670
Senior, Senior!

522
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,590
I'll drink it.

523
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,000

524
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,670

[Temple of the Primordial God]

527
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,630
I'll keep
the Great Wilderness Stele for now.

528
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,560
I'll have Ling'er try to repair it.

529
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,680
You go to the library

530
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,550
and find that book you read before.

531
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,550
Okay.

532
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,440
Did I mess up your plan?

533
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,360
It was an honest mistake.

534
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,560
How could I blame you?

535
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,870
Maybe I overlooked something
when I read the book.

536
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,840
Okay.

537
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,820
After this battle,

538
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,330
Canglei Palace surely won't let this go.

539
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,040
Have you thought of what to do next?

540
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,150
Bai Jiusi has always been
proud and arrogant.

541
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,400
Now that I've given him such a blow,

542
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,760
there's no way he'll back down easily.

543
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,510
But his primordial spirit
has taken serious damage.

544
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,110
He's no longer a match for me.

545
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,400
True.

546
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,120
He's proud and aloof,

547
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,730
but he does have…

548
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,330
some affection for you.

549
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,760
For a young boy,
you seem to know quite a bit.

Don't be too curious.
