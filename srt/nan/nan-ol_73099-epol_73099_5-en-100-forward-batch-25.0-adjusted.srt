[Episode 5]

3
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,870
Do you want to hear stories too?

4
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,170
Yun!

5
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,110
I am Heavenly Lady.

6
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,780
If you hurt me,

7
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,870
the Canglei Palace won't let you go!

8
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,770
Ning Yan.

9
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,120
Ning Yan, wake up.

10
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,450
Wake up, Ning Yan!

11
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,870
Ning Yan!

12
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,870
Help! Somebody help!

13
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,620
Steward Cang! Heavenly Lord!

14
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,120
Father, what's the matter?

15
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,530
It's windy at night.

16
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,940
To avoid you catching a cold,

17
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,220
I came to bring you another quilt.

18
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,880
Father, you're just worried that
I might go mess with Heavenly Lady, right?

19
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,030
Despite the promise you made to me today,

20
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,370
I still can't rest assured.

21
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,000
Since childhood, you've always got

22
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,680
whatever you wanted.

23
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,610
When you didn't, you just wouldn't quit.

24
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,480
Back then when you were learning
artifact forging in the mortal realm,

25
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,880
you stayed
in the forging workshop that was

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,600
scorching hot for 22 hours
without coming out.

27
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,510
All men in the yard

28
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,680
were no match for you.

29
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,850
I know you are a kind girl
with an understanding

30
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,140
of the bigger picture
and an insight into judgment.

31
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,950
But why

32
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,310
can't you get over this thing
about my master?

33
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,060
Are you done?

34
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,360
Then leave.

35
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,560
Well then,

36
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,410
g-good night.

37
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,230
Shut the doors and windows

38
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,810
and stay warm.

39
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,960
Where is your shadow?

40
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,560
You used the Shadow Assassination,

41
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,310
didn't you?

42
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,780
Oh, God!

43
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,909
Why do you want to kill me?

44
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,930
At least let me know the reason
before I die!

45
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Behave!

46
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,380
Heavenly Lord.

47
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,190
Why are you here?

48
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,210
I was hunted down by a shadow
and ended up here.

49
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,680
A shadow?

50
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,430
Yes.

51
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,170
It was holding a dagger.

52
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,880
I was attacked by it on the cliff

53
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,120
and fell off.

54
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,330
Weren't you being hunted?

55
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,010
Why did it corner you here

56
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,580
instead of killing you directly?

57
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,310
I...

58
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,360
I don't know either.

59
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,950
Yue.

60
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,760
How does it feel
to see your old friend?

61
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
What old friend?

62
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,789
I thought you were going to play dumb
for a few more days.

63
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,510
Didn't expect you
to quit pretending so soon.

64
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,510
Heavenly Lord, what do you mean?

65
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,520
Luring me to the mortal realm at the cost

66
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,280
of hurting yourself and getting close
to me by all means,

67
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,090
what on earth

68
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,540
are you up to again, Yue?

69
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,180
Do you want to kill me

70
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,760
or seal me once again?

71
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,760
Why

72
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,960
do you hate me so much?

73
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,460
Heavenly Lord, you've never believed

74
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,450
my love for you, right?

75
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,740
She won't be bullied up there, right?

76
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,910
Master.

77
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,840
Remember,

78
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,220
haste makes waste.

79
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,760
Thank you for your instruction, Master.

80
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,460
You're one of
the most talented disciples of our sect.

81
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,800
If only you had a bit more luck.

82
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,540
I never believe in luck.

83
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,840
I only believe in
righteousness and justice.

84
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,510
Give it my all, and I'll have no regrets.

85
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,440
Good.

86
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,240
Given your tenacity,

87
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,860
fate will treat you well.

88
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,720
Do you know that the Chiyang Fruit
is about to come into being?

89
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,650
Chiyang Fruit?

90
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,010
Is the Chiyang Fruit helpful

91
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,960
to my qihai?

92
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,080
Yes, of course.

93
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,670
There's only one Chiyang Fruit
in a hundred years.

94
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,460
Take it, and it can help you

95
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,270
stabilize your foundation.

96
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,090
It'll even be a piece of cake
to form a core and ascend to heaven.

97
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
But once the Chiyang Fruit emerges,

98
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,060
there will surely be
countless forces fighting for it.

99
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,670
Meng Chu remains imprisoned
in the dungeon, unwilling to repent.

100
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,470
As for Suguan,

101
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,030
she's trapped by love, not strong-minded.

102
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,180
I will have Shangguan Riyue
lead the disciples to go for it.

103
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,910
If you want to go as well,

104
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,040
just join them.

105
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,940
Yes, I want to go with them.

106
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Master.

107
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,600
I have a question.

108
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Go ahead.

109
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,200
Who is this Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

110
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,260
Why is our sect so afraid of him?

111
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,510
The Nine Heavens abound with deities

112
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,700
and are made up of

113
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,150
countless divine lands.

114
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,670
The Danxia Land
possessed by Heavenly Lord Dacheng

115
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,550
is of the most significance among them.

116
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,410
Above it is the Empyrean.

117
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,990
What's more,
the Infinite Stele on Danxia Land

118
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,460
also seals the entrance
to the demon realm.

119
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,960
So,

120
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,440
Danxia Land has entrances
to the mortal realm, demon realm,

121
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,030
and divine realm?

122
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,070
That's right.

123
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,870
So Heavenly Lord Dacheng is guarding there

124
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,000
to guarantee the safety and peace

125
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
of the Three Realms.

126
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,670
That's why he deserves
all the respect and awe.

127
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,930
Putting the Empyrean deities aside,

128
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,690
is there not a single immortal

129
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,670
in the Nine Heavens

130
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,440
who can challenge him?

131
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,000
How can we let him
do whatever he wants like a dictator?

132
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,700
Years ago, there was an ancient god

133
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,030
named Siling.

134
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,980
She could match Heavenly Lord Dacheng

135
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,020
in either power or cultivation.

136
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,910
She used to live in the Canglei Palace.

137
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,560
Where is she now?

138
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,110
She has fallen and been gone.

139
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,710
300 years ago,

140
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,680
Heavenly Lord Dacheng led his disciples

141
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,550
to launch an attack on the Canglei Palace.

142
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,790
They subdued her mount, White Snake,

143
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,030
and then annihilated Divine Lord Siling.

144
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,550
White Snake being her mount,
Siling being her title,

145
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,510
she seemed to be a woman.

146
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,720
My Lady, you need to take the medicine
to get better.

147
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,580
I've interrogated the disciples
in the Canglei Palace.

148
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,790
No one saw Her Ladyship

149
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,920
being hunted by the shadow last night.

150
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,890
As for Ning Yan in the Yuewu House,

151
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,660
she lost consciousness

152
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,580
during her cultivation last night.

153
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,390
Nothing suspicious was found.

154
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,360
Her Ladyship moved
into the Canglei Palace not long ago.

155
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,240
And we haven't found

156
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,300
anyone holding grudges against her.

157
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,550
No one noticed Her Ladyship being hunted.

158
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,850
This is indeed weird.

159
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,630
How did the assassin

160
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,630
know Ning Yan was cultivating last night

161
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,150
and manage to avoid
all the disciples?

162
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,440
Shadow Assassination
isn't an ordinary technique.

163
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,840
Only a handful of people
in the Canglei Palace can do it.

164
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,100
I'm still investigating them one by one.

165
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,500
Could it be that
there was no assassination at all?

166
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,480
Maybe Her Ladyship just didn't
want to stay in the Yuewu House,

167
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,960
so she made up this story.

168
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,430
Or...

169
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,910
Or could it be that

170
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,630
Her Ladyship was interested
in the Forbidden Pool of Eternal Frost,

171
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,150
so she used this excuse?

172
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,560
Keep investigating.

173
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,130
Yes, My Lord.

174
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,530
Maybe you should go somewhere to lay low.

175
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:41,800
Why should I?

176
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,430
If my master finds out that you did it,

177
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,410
I just can't stay
in the Nine Heavens anymore.

178
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,589
You'd better go confess

179
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,400
and apologize to my master.

180
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,640
What if I say no?

181
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Father, you can't stay out of it by giving

182
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,370
your daughter away.

183
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,330
Don't forget—it was all thanks to me
repairing His Lordship's sword

184
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,190
with my artifact-forging skills

185
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,660
that you got the chance
to become his disciple

186
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,270
and ascend to the Nine Heavens.

187
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,900
Well, I...

188
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,640
Hey.

189
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,890
I'm trying to help you!

190
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,300
I'm not as stupid as you think.

191
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,790
You know what's locked up

192
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,050
in the Forbidden Pool.

193
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,860
Now His Lordship has his mind
all set on it

194
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,790
with no spare time to investigate

195
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,650
whose shadow attempted
to assassinate Li Qingyue.

196
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,330
My Lady, you're awake.

197
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,860
Come on.

198
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
This medicine did work wonders.

199
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,860
My efforts in decocting it
with Jianmu branches just paid off.

200
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,240
Oh, right!

201
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,990
Drink it while it's hot.

202
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,040
It won't work if it gets cold.

203
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,980
The medicine is really bitter.

204
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,150
My Lady, you're severely injured.

205
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,610
You can't be picky about the medicine.

206
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,940
Did Heavenly Lord drop by?

207
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,360
No.

208
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,830
His Lordship is busy investigating

209
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,690
the culprit who hurt you, My Lady.

210
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,870
Yes, he's always busy.

211
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,640
My Lady, how about I go invite
His Lordship over?

212
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Ning Yan,

213
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,240
I think Heavenly Lord has never liked me.
Don't you think so?

214
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,760
How come?

215
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,310
If His Lordship didn't like you, My Lady,

216
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,570
why would he marry you?

217
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,960
Yeah,

218
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,950
why did he marry me?

219
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,560
Ning Yan.

220
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,510
What's that White Snake
in the Pool of Eternal Frost?

221
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,790
White Snake? What is that?

222
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,600
I saw a gigantic white snake

223
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,780
sealed in the Pool of Eternal Frost
after I fell into it.

224
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,350
That Pool is a forbidden land
in the Canglei Palace.

225
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,280
Except for His Lordship,
no one dares to approach it.

226
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,310
Besides, I've only been
in the Canglei Palace

227
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,570
for just a few decades.

228
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,940
I've never heard about that White Snake.

229
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,930
A forbidden land?

230
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,210
My Lord, the seal
of the Hell Ruins loosened again.

231
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,860
Bai Jiusi, long time no see.

232
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,380
So you're still alive
after all these years.

233
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,320
Did you kill Siling?

234
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,880
In the end,

235
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,510
men are more ruthless.

236
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,610
Look at this rosy evening glow.

237
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,940
It's the direction of the Hell Ruins.

238
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,110
Guess a demonic beast
is asking for trouble again.

239
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,490
What are you doing here?

240
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,460
Under His Lordship's order,

241
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,110
we're here to guard the yard gate.

242
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,440
What do you mean?

243
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,940
How can you not let Her Ladyship out?

244
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,750
By His Lordship's order,

245
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,680
you can't leave the Yuewu House
before we finish investigating

246
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,410
your trespassing
on the Forbidden Pool, My Lady.

247
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,620
So he still doesn't trust me.

248
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,440
My Lady.

249
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,520
Let's go back.

250
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
Are you hungry, My Lady?

251
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,620
Would you like some fruit?

252
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,210
Can you teach me magic?

253
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,300
Me?

254
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,250
I want to be as mighty as you.

255
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,480
Then I can do more than just flee

256
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,750
when someone attacks me.

257
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,610
But didn't His Lordship
already start to teach you?

258
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,160
He said I was trying
to get close to him by all means.

259
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,560
So I don't want to go
pester him all the time.

260
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,470
Don't worry, My Lady.

261
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,150
I'll teach you.

262
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,070
Look carefully, My Lady.

263
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,230
The first move is to calm down.

264
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,230
Calm down.

265
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,240
Then take root under your feet.

266
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,180
Take root under my feet.

267
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,070
Take root?

268
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,890
Yeah, that's the key to magic.

269
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,470
Without roots, how can you absorb
the energy of the earth?

270
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,790
You've got a point.

271
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,370
But I can't take root even if I want to.

272
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,270
Indeed.

273
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,990
How about I dig a pit for you to stand in?

274
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,990
Good idea.

275
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,650
Calm down.

276
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,190
Take root under my feet.

277
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,680
What?

278
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,790
They're like a crazy

279
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,260
master-disciple duo.

280
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,960
Aren't they afraid that
an unsuitable technique

281
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,220
might backfire badly?

282
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,170
Bai Jiusi, why did you catch me
and bring me here?

283
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,390
I heard that you've been

284
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,870
visiting the Yuewu House a lot lately.

285
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,170
So what?

286
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,380
Ouch!

287
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,350
You locked me up in the Canglei Palace.

288
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,200
What's wrong with me wandering around?

289
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Were you in the Yuewu House two days ago?

290
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,640
Yes.

291
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,920
Did you see anything?

292
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,150
I saw everything.

293
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,960
Tell me.

294
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,790
No.

295
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,290
What can you give me in return

296
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,740
if I tell you?

297
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,770
What do you want?

298
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,000
I want you to free me.

299
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,200
Okay.

300
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,100
Really?

301
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,460
I'm a man of my word.

302
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Listen.

303
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,330
The other day, I saw a black shadow

304
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,030
holding a dagger,

305
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,030
sneaking into Li Qingyue's room
in the dead of night.

306
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,520
Bai Jiusi.

307
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,540
Farewell.

308
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,420
W-What are you doing?

309
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,450
I said I'd free you, but I didn't

310
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,110
promise not to catch you again.

311
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,770
I already let you out just now.

312
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,020
Get back there now.

313
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,410
Bai Jiusi!

314
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,830
Bai Jiusi, what are you doing?

315
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,350
Shame on you!

316
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,200
Bai Jiusi!

317
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,350
My Lord, has your spiritual energy
been impaired?

318
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,590
Yesterday in the Hell Ruins,
I found your magic less powerful

319
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,440
than before.

320
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,520
Are you implying that I'm weak?

321
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,290
I need you to do something.

322
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes.

323
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,660
My Lady, you're awake.

324
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,530
What's up?

325
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,310
Go out to take a look.

326
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,110
Put it over there.

327
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,750
Yes.

328
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,820
Look, My Lady!

329
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,950
There are more items outside.

330
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,210
Hurry and move them in.

331
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,840
Go.

332
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

333
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,110
Where are these craftsmen from?

334
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,460
They look so familiar.

335
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,780
There are no craftsmen
in the Canglei Palace.

336
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,510
I borrowed

337
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,310
this crew from Fan Jiaojiao.

338
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,740
Lord Fan?

339
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,050
Why did you get them here?

340
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,590
I had no choice.

341
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,200
Given the Canglei Palace's
lack of craftsmen,

342
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
only they know how to nail.

343
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,940
His Lordship ordered

344
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,360
to build a kitchen for you, My Lady.

345
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,070
If you need anything for the kitchen
in the future, My Lady,

346
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,800
I'll have someone send it here.

347
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,030
A kitchen for me?

348
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:14,880
Yes.

349
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,550
Didn't you mention that
you wanted a kitchen?

350
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,750
His Lordship's been thinking about it.

351
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,040
His Lordship really
cares about you, My Lady.

352
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,310
Where are the Gate-guarding General
and the Gate-guarding Marshal?

353
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,440
His Lordship had them
continue to guard the palace gate.

354
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,670
So Heavenly Lord realized that
he got me wrong?

355
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,250
I'm not sure.

356
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,050
How about you go
ask him yourself, My Lady?

357
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,720
Does he think I'll forgive him

358
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,690
after receiving a kitchen?

359
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,850
I don't care at all.

360
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,540
My Lord, Her Ladyship seems
to still be sulking.

361
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,970
Her Ladyship just recovered.

362
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,460
Would you like to pay her a visit?

363
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,270
No need.

364
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,720
Don't sit.

365
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,090
This is my seat.

366
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,300
Sorry, I didn't see you.

367
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,980
Gazing at the starry sky every night,

368
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,470
don't you get tired of it?

369
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,440
This is mine.

370
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,970
I know it's yours. I won't grab it.

371
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,240
My mind is all over the place.

372
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,640
I need someone to talk to.

373
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,090
Where are you from?

374
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,680
Where are your parents?

375
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,010
Is your whole family
so good at telling stories?

376
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,840
Did you have a crush on someone?

377
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,400
Would she hit you?

378
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,950
Like this.

379
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,240
Strangles you.

380
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,790
Doesn't trust you

381
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,110
and even suspects that
you are up to no good.

382
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,110
Would you get mad?

383
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,750
What a noisy chatterbox.

384
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,240
Well, tell me a story then.

385
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,280
Are you sure?

386
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,360
Go ahead.

387
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
Once upon a time, a girl married someone

388
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,470
from the Canglei Palace.

389
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,440
But her husband left her

390
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
alone on some remote

391
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,240
mountain peak.

392
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,920
She went through trials and tribulations

393
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,270
to find her husband.

394
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,830
But she was thrown

395
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,330
into a remote courtyard again.

396
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,830
No matter how hard

397
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,230
that girl tried to get close
to her husband,

398
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,840
her husband

399
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
remained aloof and distant toward her.

400
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,440
Later, the girl was
hunted down by someone

401
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,020
and almost died.

402
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,570
Her husband not only showed no concern

403
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,110
but also thought she was making it up.

404
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,270
Then the girl started to doubt

405
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,360
her husband's love for her.

406
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,030
She thought that
her husband had never loved her.

407
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,020
But she didn't know that

408
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,580
her husband often came back
to see her in secret.

409
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,090
Her husband had
complicated feelings for her,

410
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,260
like love and hatred,

411
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,590
but there was never abhorrence.

412
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,590
What do you want?

413
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,990
So

414
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,030
he still loves his wife,

415
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,720
right?

416
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
That's deep love.

417
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,680
But now I'm

418
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,200
going to tell a story about him.

419
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,190
It's about counting heads.

420
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,740
One.

421
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,400
Two.

422
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,710
I don't want to hear it.

423
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,550
Li Qingyue!

424
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,780
You are as shameless as Bai Jiusi.

425
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,330
You even lied to a child.

426
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,000
My Lady, is this the scrumptious
kitchen aroma you mentioned?

427
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,719
No.

428
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,800
I haven't cooked in a while.
I'm a bit rusty on it.

429
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,929
Put out the fire now.

430
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,940
Sorry,

431
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,429

Master,

484
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,480
how about you and your wife
hold an official wedding?

485
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,970
My Lord, Her Ladyship
went to the Linyuan Pavilion for you.

486
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,600
How swiftly he teleported.

487
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,410
Heavenly Lord, you built me a kitchen.

488
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,210
So I made some homestyle dishes

489
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,590
and brought them here for you to try.

490
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,310
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, don't be mad.

491
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,840
How about I make you dinner tonight

492
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,640
as an apology?

493
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,180
You can cook?

494
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,910
This dish is Braised Pork Balls in Gravy.

495
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,110
This is rib soup. This is a lamb shank.

496
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I've boiled the shank
with water and vinegar to get rid

497
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,530
of the muttony odor.

498
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,290
And this.

499
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,820
I didn't even share it
with Ning Yan and the others.

500
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,150
The crab roe is really good.

501
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,940
Give it a try.

502
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,230
Just some ordinary dishes
from the mortal realm.

503
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,160
I wonder if they're to your liking.

504
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,730
Let me help you, Heavenly Lord.

505
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,490
Here you are.

506
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,460
Is it good?

507
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,960
Not bad.

508
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,830
Nice!

509
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,890
You haven't eaten yet?

510
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,280
The food I made

511
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,670
was eaten up by Yin Tongzi and Ning Yan.

512
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,360
I'll go back
and make some more for myself later.

513
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,400
But I need Steward Cang

514
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,540
to send more ingredients to my place.

515
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:33,720
Cang Tu is in charge of all the chores
and affairs in the Canglei Palace,

516
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,120
unable to attend
to your needs all the time.

517
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Sit next to me.

518
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,310
Let's eat together.

519
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,190
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

520
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,700
Why aren't you eating?

521
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,820
I only brought one pair of chopsticks.

522
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,700
It's okay. The spoon works too.

523
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,440
It's fine.

524
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,680
Why are you smiling?

525
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,610
So sweet. The pork balls are delectable.

526
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,560
But it's a salty dish.

527
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,790
How could it be sweet?

528
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,630
Yeah. How could it be sweet?

529
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,910
Zip it and eat.

530
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,670
Though immortals don't need to eat,

531
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,190
if you like it, Heavenly Lord,

532
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,320
I can cook something for you every day.

533
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,630
Okay.

534
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,490
See you tomorrow then.

535
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,810
You really don't remember the White Snake

536
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,590
in the Pool of Eternal Frost?

537
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,570
Why do you ask so?

538
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,770
Just a random question.

539
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,500
It's fine if you don't know it.

540
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,140
It's been trapped in that Pool
for 11 years with its soul

541
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,870
subdued by the golden needles.

542
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,100
It's dying.

543
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,290
Today is its last day.

544
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,650
By noon tomorrow,

545
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,070
the golden needles
will finish refining it.

546
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,780
Its divine bones will vanish.

547
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,840
And you won't be able to find it even if

548
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,040
you search the entire Hell.

549
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,070
A puppet?
