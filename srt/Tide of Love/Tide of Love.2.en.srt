1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,240
Take a good look.

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,970
This is what you wanted.

3
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,590
Today,

4
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,630
you just need to feel my warmth.

5
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,930
Kneel.

6
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,210
Take your clothes off.

7
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,770
Why are you burning hot?

8
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,860
Because I took a shower.

9
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,860
A shower?

10
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,930
Didn't you take a cold shower?

11
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,020
It happens.

12
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,920
Come to me.

13
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,700
I asked you to come.

14
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,159
How are you

15
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,500
going to spend the 2,000 dollars

16
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,740
apart from your mother's surgery?

17
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,090
I want to go to Florence.

18
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,400
I want to see the real French Renaissance.

19
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,910
Florence?

20
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,440
With 2,000 dollars?

21
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,290
Yeah.

22
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,660
To see the real Renaissance.

23
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
We only signed a sleeping contract.

24
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,980
Now,

25
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,410
can you sign a contract with me?

26
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,870
What do you mean?

27
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,780
Like this.

28
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,550
Are you game for a blood contract?

29
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,640
Even if you're hungry,
eating without permission

30
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,530
is a bad habit.

31
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
If you want to eat,

32
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,170
tell me with your mouth.

33
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,730
Like this.

34
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,780
Good boy.

35
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,160
Slow down or you might get hurt.

36
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,510
From now on, only eat what I give you.

37
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,100
Mr. Han.

38
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,170
Are you really a rich heir?

39
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,860
Aren't you cold-blooded?

40
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,730
I guess you eat kimchi stew too.

41
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,000
What about you?

42
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,800
Don't art students live on inspiration?

43
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,460
Look at you, gobbling that bread.

44
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,360
Eat that.

45
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,659
It's way better.

46
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,040
You know...

47
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,410
I heard rumors

48
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
that you played Chopin all night

49
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,030
in front of the College of Music
for a girl.

50
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,300
You're really imaginative.

51
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,520
Use that imagination in your art instead.

52
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,580
Also,

53
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,120
I didn't do it for a girl.

54
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,200
It was just a punishment for a game.

55
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,860
If you say such nonsense again,

56
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,780
I'll only feed you iced Americano.

57
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,950
Why iced Americano?

58
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,680
Aren't you going to answer me?

59
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,510
I don't like iced Americano.

60
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,290
Eat your food.
