1
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,770
My professor said this
when he explained perspective:

2
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,600
The bigger the comparison object is,
the smaller a person looks.

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,430
Right now,

4
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,550
I'm the ant inside that picture.

5
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,340
Mom,

6
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,490
I got a part-time job.

7
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,070
It's so embarrassing
I want to crawl into a hole.

8
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,930
I just can't bring myself to tell you

9
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,590
what kind of job it is exactly.

10
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,810
But

11
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,070
with the money it pays,

12
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,220
I can cover your hospital bills.

13
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,070
If you can get healthy again,

14
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,990
my pride

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,670
is not important.

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,220
I'm still young,

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,180
but I think I've toughened up a little.

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,460
If it means your surgery goes well,

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
I can endure anything

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,890
and

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,130
do anything.

22
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,250
Good morning.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,380
The tenth one.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Give me your luggage.

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,700
It's okay.

26
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,229
I'll do it.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,400
Not even a "hi"

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,729
or "hello."

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,440
Really feels like
I'm just a product or something.

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,880
You're the tenth art student

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,540
my secretary selected for me.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,329
I only sleep with art students.

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,579
I have three rules.

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,540
First,

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,180
come whenever I call.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Second,

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,020
keep your distance from everyone
except me.

38
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,280
Third,

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,579
absolute

40
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,670
obedience.

41
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,590
Keep my distance from everyone?

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,900
Even my professors,

43
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,320
my friends,

44
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,470
and my creative world?

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,960
What about my Monday classes?

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,280
Do you understand?

47
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,300
Yes.

48
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,340
Understood, sir.

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,530
What’s this scar?

50
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,520
Does it hurt?

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,270
Right now,

52
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,370
it doesn't.

53
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,200
If you break my rules,

54
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,190
I can make you hurt more than this.

55
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,430
You understand?

56
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,300
That's about enough.

57
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,720
So you do lose control too.

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,560
Come in.

59
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,600
I left the contract period and pay blank.

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,740
You decide.

61
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,390
The upper limit

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,830
is whatever you can handle.

63
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,780
Mom's surgery fees

64
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,300
and my tuition...

65
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,250
Just endure it.

66
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,550
This night might be

67
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,620
a turning point in my life.

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,390
Han Jaehun?

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,890
He's just a client who hired me.

70
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,610
All of this

71
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,290
is just work to me.

72
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,330
Then...

73
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,590
1,000 dollars

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,100
for one night.

75
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,500
Do I look pitiful to him?

76
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,470
Sure.

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,150
But

78
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
2,000 dollars...

79
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,430
means it might hurt just as much more.

80
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,130
Can you handle it?

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,390
Ah!

82
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,210
What was that look?

83
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,860
If you don't like it,

84
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,910
you can say so now.

85
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,360
No.

86
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,140
I'm fine.

87
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,490
Relax.

88
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,050
From now on,

89
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,380
you'll get used to everything.

90
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,640
Your kissing skills

91
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,510
are better than I thought.

92
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,530
Not bad.

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,890
From now on, your time,

94
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,470
your body,

95
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,640
and, at times, even your heart...

96
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,570
All of it belongs to me.

97
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,060
You're crazy,

98
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,300
sir.

99
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,160
Yeah.

100
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm crazy.

101
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,860
Take a good look.

102
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,380
This is what you wanted.
