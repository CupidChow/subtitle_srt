1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,320
Eat the porridge.
-Han Jaehun.

2
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:49,800
This is...

3
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,820
A note written by Hyung.

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,200
Even the handwriting

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,350
is just like him—

6
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,250
clean, proper, and pretty.

7
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,000
I didn't know he studied architecture.

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,300
The blueprints he draws are amazing.

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,000
Yet now, he's making me a bowl of porridge.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,520
That's when I realized

11
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,750
what attracts me the most

12
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,770
is not Han Jaehun who looks stronger than anyone professionally,

13
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,500
but him who thinks and cares for me

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,700
like this.

15
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,150
What were you doing?

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,150
Han Jaehun.

17
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,220
Yes?

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,570
What is this?

19
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,950
This was from a long time ago.

20
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,400
Exactly.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So why do you still keep this?

22
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,020
Are you jealous?

23
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,470
Who said I was jealous?

24
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,950
I just feel a little uncomfortable.

25
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,600
Hmm.

26
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,020
There's only

27
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,170
you here.

28
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,700
Only Kim Haejun.

29
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,750
Let's go, jealous boy.

30
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,850
Let's go.

31
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,550
I made this. Drink it.

32
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,180
Drink it.

33
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,050
You should try some too.

34
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,820
No, you should try some too.

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,350
Ouch. It's hot.

36
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,070
Good work.

37
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,370
Haejun.

38
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,470
Well...

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,750
Wait. Excuse me.

40
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,500
Hi, Mom.

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,920
I'm having dinner with my friends.

42
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,770
It's his birthday today

43
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,620
so I made your famous noodles for him.

44
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,070
You said one would live long
if they eat noodles on their birthday.

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
He's my best friend.

46
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,570
Okay.

47
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,800
I love you.

48
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,070
Bye.

49
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm so touched.

50
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,500
Don't get me wrong.

51
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,070
I got dust in my eyes.

52
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,700
This is the first time

53
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,300
someone wished me happy birthday.

54
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,200
When I was young,

55
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,320
it was my father's secretary who'd deliver an envelope/Non my birthday every year.

56
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,670
It was a lot if money,

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
but I was never once told,
"Let's have a meal."

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
As for my mother...

59
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,270
My mother

60
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,350
passed away before I could remember—

61
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
disappeared just like smoke.

62
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,620
So I always thought birthdays were quiet.

63
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,950
But you're different.

64
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,150
You were complaining
about tearing up when cutting onions

65
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,870
yet was answering your mum's phone
with a smile,

66
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,970
and made me noodles.

67
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,570
This bowl of noodles

68
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,270
is the first bowl of hot noodles

69
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,570
made by someone important to me.

70
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,470
I'm not good at words,

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,820
but my smile is real.

72
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,070
Hyung.

73
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,820
I'll wipe your tears.

74
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,050
I'll always be by your side.

75
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
So,

76
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,220
don't feel uneasy anymore.

77
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,419
Who told you to do that?

78
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,789
That's cheating.

79
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,350
Hyung!

80
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,050
Hyung.

81
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,420
Let's eat cake.

82
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,550
You haven't eaten anything yet.

83
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,250
Hey! What are you doing?

84
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,190
You got cream on your face.
