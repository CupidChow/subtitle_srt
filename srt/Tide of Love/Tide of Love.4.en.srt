00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,710
Hello.

2
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,600
Hello.

3
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,660
[Money]

4
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,440
[Honey]

5
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,640
Haejun, can I borrow your notebook?

6
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,810
Sure.

7
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,980
Let me find it.

8
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,260
I remember you like apples.

9
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,780
I brought this from home.

10
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,620
Have it.

11
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,850
Haejun, I'm leaving.

12
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,920
Who gave you permission
to accept gifts from others?

13
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,159
Who gave you

14
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,820
permission to

15
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,310
accept gifts from others?

16
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,630
Who gave you

17
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,480
permission to

18
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,970
accept gifts from others?

19
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Have you forgotten my rules?

20
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,850
Except me,

21
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,730
keep your distance from everyone else.

22
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,000
You can't leave me.

23
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,500
Come here.

24
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,420
Sorry.

25
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,400
Class is almost over.

26
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,700
Let go of me!

27
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,810
Why are you doing this to me?

28
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,760
Because you're mine.

29
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,820
I don't like this.

30
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,510
So what?

31
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,650
You can't leave me.

32
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,040
Behave.

33
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,670
Understand?

34
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,470
Let go of me!

35
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,790
It'll be fine.

36
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,750
Please behave,

37
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,710
okay?
