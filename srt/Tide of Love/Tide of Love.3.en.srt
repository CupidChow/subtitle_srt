1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,830
I was alone on holidays.

2
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,630
At school

3
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,830
or at home,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,200
I always felt lonely.

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,600
He has everything,

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,750
but he is still alone.

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,810
In the end,

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,780
we're the same, both lonely.

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,810
Would you like

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,090
a warm drink?

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,570
Can't believe

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,190
it's a one-month contract.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,500
They were usually just

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,900
one-night stands,

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,990
relationships

16
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,520
that disintegrate by dawn.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,460
But you

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,560
actually

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,620
gave this a month.

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,370
You were serious

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,690
and sincere.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,850
I could tell by your eyes.

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,620
It's an earnestness

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,750
I don't understand.

25
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,090
I should've refused you.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,060
That's my usual style.

27
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,550
But I don't know why

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,539
I felt drawn

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,650
to the "one month."

30
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,660
Yeah.

31
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,290
Mom.

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,530
It's me.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,740
Got it.

34
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,430
I've found the best doctor too.

35
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,870
Don't worry about money.

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,230
I've also

37
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,110
taken care of my tuition.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,890
I'm not a kid anymore.

39
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,390
Okay.

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,660
Bye.

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,900
I love you.

42
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,330
He didn't meet anyone today, did he?

43
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,110
Good.

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
Keep monitoring him.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,060
So I see your spy's just

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,210
reported my whereabouts to you.

47
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,290
Before that,

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,660
have a look at this.

49
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,770
It's a new contract

50
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,690
for another month.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,110
I've adjusted the terms.

52
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,910
Jaehun-hyung,

53
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,700
just one more month.

54
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,470
It'll only

55
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,220
cost you 10,000 dollars.

56
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,410
I'll do anything you want.

57
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,420
Anything.

58
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,990
Jaehun-hyung!

59
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,790
I'm here.

60
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,480
You only have wine and salad every day.

61
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,990
Eat something regular at times.

62
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,050
What kind of service do you want tonight?

63
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,810
Haejun is always smiling.

64
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,320
His smile is so bright that

65
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,060
this thing we have almost feels real.

66
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,880
But I found out by chance today

67
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,310
that beneath his smile

68
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,440
is a heavy heart.

69
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,850
He shoulders so much alone,

70
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,180
yet he always
greets me with a warm smile.

71
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,090
When I knew of his troubled soul,

72
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,220
I began to feel for him a little.

73
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,940
Now,

74
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,900
I want to protect his smile.

75
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,630
Even just a little,

76
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,460
I'll be more gentle.
