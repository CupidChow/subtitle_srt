1
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:23,800
In the past,

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,870
when Hyung smiles,
I feel a sense of distance.

3
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,990
There's a layer of fog
covering the smile.

4
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,490
But...

5
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,200
it's different now.

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,150
Hyung

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,550
is smiling
from the bottom of his heart now.

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,490
It's warm

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,020
and sincere.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,960
At that moment,

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,800
my heart

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,460
would feel like it's free falling.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,130
Hyung,

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,970
do you know?

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,400
Your smile

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,850
shines brighter than anything.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,180
That smile

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
is really letting me

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,760
into your heart.

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,800
When you were reading,

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,760
I liked to stand by and cook for you.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,560
That ordinary moment

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,830
is the realest happiness

24
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,910
in my world.

25
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,310
Just like this steam,

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,580
my heart

27
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,100
is silently surrounding you.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,100
When I'm messing around

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,320
and you can't stop

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,200
laughing,

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,180
that's evidence of my love for you

32
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,789
and your love for me.

33
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,960
What are you doing?

34
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,350
You've been having issues with me lately,
haven't you?

35
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,740
Then do it yourself, Chef.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,850
I don't want to eat by myself.

37
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,410
You should try it too.

38
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,750
How is it?

39
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,660
How does it taste this time?

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
It's sweet.

41
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,490
Everything you give is sweet.

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,080
As if.

43
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
What are you doing? It's cold.

44
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,320
When I saw you wearing the Loopy apron,

45
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,760
I realized that
no matter how cold you are,

46
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,210
you will slowly melt for someone.

47
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,750
And that person

48
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
is me.

49
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,560
What is this?

50
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,070
A critical notice from the hospital.

51
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,100
Why can a piece of paper

52
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,010
cause so much pain?

53
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,800
Dr. David.

54
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,600
I need to book the room now.

55
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,750
Just right now.

56
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Yes, VIP-1.

57
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,500
I'll be the guarantor personally.

58
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,850
Why are you...

59
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,690
doing so much to help me?

60
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,400
Because I want to.

61
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,290
What I want is

62
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,020
when you want to cry,

63
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,870
the first person you think of is me.

64
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,090
Hyung.

65
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I really want to tell you something.

66
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,550
Can I really rely on you?

67
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,270
I

68
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
am not that strong

69
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,430
and am not that good at things.

70
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,650
I know I always cause you to be upset.

71
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,950
But...

72
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,900
Hyung,

73
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,580
you've always been by my side
looking after me.

74
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,230
I'm used to being alone,

75
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
but I now I want to rely on you.

76
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,880
Hyung.

77
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,450
Is this really okay?

78
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,470
Can I

79
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
really completely rely on you?

80
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,040
Haejun.

81
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,060
Look at me.

82
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,920
It'll be okay.

83
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,900
I will protect everything—

84
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,970
everything you care about.

85
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,400
Your mum will recover.

86
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,520
Your mum will be fine.

87
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,180
It will all turn out to be fine.

88
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,820
This not consolation. It's a promise.

89
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,400
So stop crying alone.

90
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,980
Don't be sad anymore.
Your worries are now my worries too.

91
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,920
Protecting your smile

92
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
is my reason to live.

93
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
So,

94
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,600
please give yourself

95
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
and your future to me.

96
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,360
I'll do anything for you.
