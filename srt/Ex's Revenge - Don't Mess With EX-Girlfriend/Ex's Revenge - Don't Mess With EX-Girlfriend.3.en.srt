=Episode 3=

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,039
An Duoduo, be civilized.

4
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,120
How could you hit her?

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
I didn't hit her.

6
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,920
Apologize to Weiwei now.

7
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,799
No way.

8
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:35,679
Qin Lang.

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,359
We've been together for seven years.

10
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,600
Don't you believe me?

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,479
That's because I know you too well.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,439
You are

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,640
competitive

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,880
and impulsive.

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,840
I thought it was your personality.

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,280
But now

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,560
I only find you

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,240
rude and willful.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,920
How could I not notice

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,439
that you are so stupid?

21
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,560
Never mind.

22
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,039
It's understandable that she hates me.

23
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,280
Darling,

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,840
don't be angry at her.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,879
How could you defend her?

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,000
You're too kind.

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,319
An Duoduo.

28
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,439
Apologize right now,

29
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,920
or

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,120
I'll have to punish you

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,840
according to company rules
and regulations.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,079
Punish me?

33
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,920
Well, before that

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,879
let me give you a feel of

35
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,719
your wife's acting.

36
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,560
(Don't think I don't know)

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
(your marriage with Qin Qi is fake.)

38
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,680
(What a shame.)

39
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,599
(What's fake cannot be true.)

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
(From what I can see,)

41
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,640
(you are nothing but a powerless ant)

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,359
(that only deserves to
be crashed by me.)

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,640
What...

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,799
Weiwei,

45
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,439
What's going on?

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
It is not true.

47
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,599
Darling,

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,799
she maliciously edited it to frame me.

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,560
You both are

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,719
disgusting.

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,439
An Duoduo.

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,040
An Duoduo.

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,199
"The face is no index to the heart."

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,919
I didn't expect her to be a vile person

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,199
apart from being a mistress.

56
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,080
To think we made friends with her.

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
Faugh!

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,240
It was all my fault.

59
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,240
I was blind then

60
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
I even showed her my draft.

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,879
Well now,

62
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,319
there's no way to prove it's mine.

63
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,400
The coffee tastes good.

64
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,759
Drink more and cool down.

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,199
She got the job

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,120
by pulling strings.

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,840
She can't design at all.

68
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,319
Since you know Qin Lang's uncle,

69
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,960
why don't you ask him for help?

70
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,520
It...

71
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,919
(What can I do?)

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
(I took your money,)

73
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,439
(so I'm all yours.)

74
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,350
(Groom Qin Lang, Bride Li Weiwei)

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,120
We only met once.

76
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't even have his contact number.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
For this matter,

78
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,800
I have to rely on myself.

79
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,680
What do you have in mind?

80
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,240
She can

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
have the man.

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,039
But jewelry design is my dream,

83
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,599
so I must

84
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,039
get my design back.

85
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,290
(Complaint Letter)

86
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,710
(Qin's Jewelry)

87
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,680
Ms. An.

88
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,280
Shall we talk?

89
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,599
Bring her in.

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Let me go.

91
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,199
I can walk by myself.

92
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:54,840
Over there.

93
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't need your help.

94
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,719
Don't push me.

95
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,680
Sit down.

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,960
I'll snap your finger
if you point it at me again.

97
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,879
Boss.

98
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,000
Mrs. Qin's in trouble.

99
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,800
Now tell me

100
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,279
why you

101
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,680
invited me over?

102
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,120
(Complaint Letter)

103
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,839
How did you get this?

104
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,040
My son is the vice president,

105
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,680
so any sign of trouble

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,399
cannot escape my eyes.

107
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,199
If I want,

108
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,199
I can stop all your emails

109
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,519
from reaching the higher-ups.

110
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
Thanks for your reminding.

111
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,879
It seems that next time

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,959
I'll have to hold a sign
in front of the head office.

113
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,240
An Duoduo.

114
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,879
Put away your little tricks.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,920
I know you still love my son,

116
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,480
and try to attract his attention.

117
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,680
Just to let you know,

118
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,279
don't waste time pestering him.

119
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,519
No matter what you do,

120
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,519
it's useless.

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,399
If you're clever,

122
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
just take the 200,000 yuan

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
and leave.

124
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,839
Never show up

125
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,240
in front of us again.

126
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,800
Bravo.

127
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,000
The long-awaited scene finally comes.

128
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,079
Breaking up with Qin Lang

129
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,639
seems a good deal.

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
I knew it.

131
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,319
A wild girl from the countryside

132
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
only cares about money.

133
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,240
But

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,079
this is

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,279
too little.

136
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,439
What did you say?

137
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Do you remember the photos

138
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,879
that I gave to the guests
on the wedding?

139
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,040
Do you like them?

140
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,240
I have plenty of

141
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,680
great photos of your son.

142
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,920
Would you like to buy them all?

143
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,160
You...

144
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,160
You...

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,199
I request your public apology

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,439
and admission of stealing my design,

147
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,199
or you won't see the end of it.

148
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,639
Boss.

149
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,199
Where?

150
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,720
Inside.

151
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
The hero is going to save the beauty.

152
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:26,839
Come on!

153
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,000
Go away.

154
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:32,759
Mom.

155
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,439
Why are you here?

156
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,720
They bullied you?

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,759
Apologize to her now.

158
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,639
No, no.

159
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,759
Otherwise,

160
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
get out of Qin family.

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,879
Sorry.

162
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,839
Louder.

163
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,120
Say it three times.

164
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,839
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

165
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,519
I'll not allow anyone to bully my wife.

166
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,240
Who is indeed the bully?

167
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,720
Thank you so much tonight.

168
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,439
I'll be off then. Bye.

169
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,680
Next time they trouble you,

170
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,279
just call me.

171
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,450
(Qin Qi, CEO)

172
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,160
The president of Qin Group.

173
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,199
Take it easy.

174
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
I do not judge people
by how much money they own.

175
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,240
But why are you so nice to me?

176
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,040
I don't suppose
you want something from me?

177
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,959
The whole Qin family
attended our wedding.

178
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,240
What do you say?

179
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,680
Honey.

180
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,480
It's a sham marriage.

181
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,439
A fake one.

182
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,800
But

183
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,720
I've lost my singleness to you.

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,440
You must take the responsibility.

185
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,120
Take me as trash then.

186
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,759
Being with me,

187
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,679
you can get lots of benefits.

188
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,639
There's no free lunch in the world.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,279
I have work to do.

190
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:48,879
I've got to go.

191
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,240
Ma'am.

192
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,039
What's happening?

193
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,440
The rent is due in half a month,

194
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,440
and we agreed to renew the lease.

195
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,879
Sorry, Miss An.

196
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,879
This house

197
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,399
was purchased at a high price.

198
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,639
Recently I've been

199
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,440
short of money.

200
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,080
So I couldn't reject the offer.

201
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,799
There's no rush to move out today.

202
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,519
The buyer asked you to leave today,

203
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,360
or they will not pay me.

204
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,639
I have no other choice.

205
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,879
I'll refund your deposit later.

206
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,159
Well.

207
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,919
The buyer can't be that ruthless.

208
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,720
Maybe you can give me their numbers.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll talk to them.

210
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,360
The name seems to be

211
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,240
Li Weiwei.

212
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,399
Li Weiwei?

213
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,159
Anyway,

214
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,399
you have to move out today.

215
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,120
Li Weiwei.

216
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,159
Qin Lang,

217
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,559
we agreed to rent

218
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,159
this house together then.

219
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,320
It's okay you didn't pay a cent.

220
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,000
But now you're buying it

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,320
for Li Weiwei.

222
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
How generous you are.

223
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
Duoduo.

224
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,240
I know you can't forget me.

225
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,919
But you can't hurt Weiwei

226
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,039
again and again.

227
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
I hurt her?

228
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,960
Yesterday, you gave my mom
and Weiwei a hard time

229
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,879
and poured water all over them.

230
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,960
You've gone too far.

231
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:33,840
An Duoduo,

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm married.

233
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
Stop badgering my family,

234
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,960
and do not try to seduce me anymore.

235
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,720
Darling, I have a headache.

236
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,240
See?

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,320
Weiwei got a cold because of you.

238
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
All right. Suit yourself.

239
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,919
She needs me.

240
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,799
Are you okay, Weiwei?

241
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
You are nuts.

242
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,799
Duoduo.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,919
Come to my house.

244
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,279
Duoduo.

245
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Since Li Weiwei wants a fight,

246
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,639
I will fight her till the end.
