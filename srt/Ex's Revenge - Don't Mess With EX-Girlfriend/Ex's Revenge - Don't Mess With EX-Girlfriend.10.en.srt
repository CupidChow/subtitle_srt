=Episode 10=

3
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,160
Qin Qi, President of Qin Group,

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,280
was in fury for a beauty.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,640
At the press conference, he announced...

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,480
What's this?

7
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,120
(It's said that his wife is)

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,039
(an ordinary jewelry designer.)

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,359
You two are living together,

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,439
yet you kept it from me!

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,679
Sorry, my friend.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,960
It's super sweet.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
Actually it's not true about

14
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,600
Qin Qi and me.

15
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,679
What's true then?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,600
Are you going to say that you have

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
a contractual marriage

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,920
which will end in three months?

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,640
You think you're living in
a romance novel?

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, do you believe

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,119
that sometimes

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,079
novels actually come from reality?

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:07,879
Chengzi!

24
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,680
Take a deep breath!

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,280
Come on!

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,760
Exhale!

27
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,640
Excuse me?

28
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:14,879
You,

29
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,400
you must tell me everything honestly.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,000
Everything and every detail.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,519
Tell me

32
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,359
the whole story.

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,280
Why... why don't...

34
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,680
Why don't you have a drink first?

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,400
No, no, no.

36
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,280
No, no, no.

37
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,359
Come on.

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
We've kissed twice.

39
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,640
She still refuses to
be responsible for me.

40
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,599
Well, boss.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
Have you ever told her

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
that you like her?

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,079
Is that necessary?

44
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,640
I've made it so obvious.

45
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,239
Maybe,

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
probably,

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,159
perhaps,

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,239
girls need more direct words.

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,359
Direct?

50
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,359
Are you suggesting me...

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,319
confess my love?

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,799
Yes.

53
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,719
Secretary Zhang, surely you're smart.

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,719
What?

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,400
You kissed under the tree?

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Calm down.

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
He did it on the spur of the moment.

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,639
How could a person like Qin Qi

59
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,319
act on the spur of the moment?

60
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,039
Have you ever thought

61
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,560
that he was willing to be your groom

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,039
because he was really into you?

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,919
I know

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm charming.

65
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,520
But we have totally different lives,

66
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,639
and we're not in the same circle.

67
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,560
We don't match. He won't understand me.

68
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,159
Does Qin Qi know you are so confident?

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,960
I mean, Qin Qi will
definitely fall in love with you

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,159
if he knows you well.

71
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,199
Don't say that.

72
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,560
If it's true,

73
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,800
I don't dare to live here.

74
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,039
Duoduo.

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Ask yourself,

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,240
do you really feel nothing for him?

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,479
Of course!

78
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:13,400
(Qin Qi)

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,199
9 a.m. tomorrow,

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
see you at Rose Park.

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,840
Women.

82
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,000
Women!

83
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,439
Li Weiwei.

84
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,400
Did you steal Duoduo's design

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,240
for Rongchang Jewelry to
copy her necklace?

86
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,240
It was not me!

87
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,840
You still want to cheat me.

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,719
Here.

89
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,240
I've read your messages with Mr. Lin.

90
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,919
See for yourself.

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,879
Did you check my phone?

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Right. It was me.

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,159
Mr. Lin said once I helped him,

94
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,439
he would help you make CEO.

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
All I did was for you!

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,280
For me?

97
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,240
You did it

98
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,879
for yourself!

99
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,759
You stole Duoduo's drafts

100
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,759
again and again.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,199
Do you have a conscience?

102
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,240
You said it was for me,

103
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,560
but in fact, it was for your vanity.

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
Li Weiwei, let me ask you,

105
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,959
if I were not the son of the Qin family,

106
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
without the vice presidency,

107
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,399
would you still love me?

108
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,959
There is no "if".

109
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,879
Let's be frank,

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,920
An Duoduo is all you think about.

111
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,040
How about me?

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
What am I?

113
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,319
What a shame,

114
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,399
An Duoduo is your aunt now.

115
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
Duoduo was right.

116
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,879
I was blind.

117
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,519
Li Weiwei, from now on,

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
we are divorced.

119
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,839
Divorced!

120
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,079
What did you say?

121
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,720
You want a divorce?

122
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,839
No way!

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,360
An Duoduo.

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,199
It's you.

125
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,839
It's all your fault.

126
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,439
I'll make you disappear forever!

127
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,639
Duoduo.

128
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,639
I like you.

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,399
Be my real Mrs. Qin,

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,759
will you?

131
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:00,920
Cut!

132
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,079
Absolutely perfect.

133
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,319
Is everything ready?

134
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,600
Sure.

135
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,439
A drone to scatter flower petals.

136
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,240
A band to create the atmosphere.

137
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,040
A big cake to show your love!

138
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,000
And a cruise firework party
for the evening!

139
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,639
Also,

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,680
I even prepared a honeymoon package.

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
You can set out at once.

142
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,560
Boss,

143
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,279
are you being...

144
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,759
nervous?

145
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,920
Hello.

146
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,959
It's me. Duoduo.

147
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,480
Are you at home?

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,920
I have something to tell you.

149
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm not interested.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,399
Duoduo.

151
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,759
In fact, your work was plagiarized

152
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,480
because of Li Weiwei.

153
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I want to apologize.

154
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't need it.

155
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,199
(Duoduo.)

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,639
(I'm sorry!)

157
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,360
(You were right all along.)

158
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,600
It was my fault.

159
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,839
What I did to you was wrong.

160
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,040
I...

161
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,600
Qin Lang.

162
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,120
We've broken up.

163
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,040
What you think means

164
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,120
nothing to me.

165
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
Don't contact me again.

166
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,519
Hello? Hello?

167
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:47,959
Duoduo!

168
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,879
Oh, no.

169
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm running late.

170
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,360
Duoduo!

171
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,279
Qin Lang.

172
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,319
Qin Lang!

173
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,199
Qin Lang, are you alright?

174
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,039
I... I'll call an ambulance.

175
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,600
Don't worry.

176
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll call right now.

177
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,120
Duoduo, listen to me.

Duoduo.

179
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,159
Can you get up?

180
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,320
Duoduo.

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,279
I...

182
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm really regretful.

183
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,240
It's fine.

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,159
You'll be fine.

185
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
Call an ambulance...

186
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,039
