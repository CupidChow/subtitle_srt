=Episode 7=

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,760
Let me repeat it one more time,
and this is serious.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,079
Mr. Qin,

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,199
we are going to be together
for three months only.

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,559
There is no need to let others know.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
It's not good for both of us.

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,719
Do you hear me?

9
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,560
I will think about it.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,840
Think about it?

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,399
It's the gathering of
the Design Department.

12
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,479
I hope you enjoy this evening.

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,280
Dig in.

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,840
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,880
Other than words,

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
let's drink a toast to Mr. Qin.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,960
to thank him.

18
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,560
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,320
And to celebrate
the promotion of An Duoduo as well.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,200
That's so weird.

21
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:01,759
Well...

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,880
Thank you for your recognition, Mr. Qin.

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,560
Duoduo,

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,120
how did you know Mr. Qin?

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,000
We...

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
It was that time,

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,040
remember?

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,200
Thank you, Mr. Qin,
for speaking out the truth

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,719
and proving
that Li Weiwei stole my design.

30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,719
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

31
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,719
You are fair

32
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,879
and righteous,

33
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,040
and you wouldn't allow
any of your employees to be wronged.

34
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,599
It was like you...

35
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,640
gave me a second life.

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,200
Come on. Let me

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,840
drink this up.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,640
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,799
I guess Mr. Qin is hungry.

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,239
Let's start eating.

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,079
Alright.

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,840
Cheers.

43
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
A second life?

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,400
Yummy?

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Yummy.

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
Just eat,

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,719
Father.

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,079
But we are...

49
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:02,959
Eat.

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,800
Let me say something.

51
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,400
We are so glad

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,960
that Mr. Qin could join us today.

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,879
Therefore,

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
let me give you a performance.

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,280
I will drink to the bottom

56
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,439
to liven up, alright?

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,599
Yes!

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,199
Come on! Come on!

59
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,919
Drink!

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,719
Come on!

61
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,479
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

62
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,560
My bad. My bad.

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Qin.

64
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:39,879
Are you alright?

65
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm fine.

66
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,039
I'm so sorry.

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,360
That performance was ridiculous.

68
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,599
An Duoduo is so good at
flattering the boss.

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,960
She was just dumped by Qin Lang,

70
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,080
and now she is with Qin Qi.

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,039
She even put the skewer
in Qin Qi's mouth.

72
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,199
Shameless.

73
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,960
I doubt that she was the one

74
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,280
behind the whole thing of Li Weiwei.

75
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,560
She's taking it out at work.

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,439
Qin Lang was so good to her,

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,680
and she just changed her mind
after meeting Qin Qi.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,039
Li Weiwei was right.

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,159
She's a bumpkin

80
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,000
who only cares about money and power.

81
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,800
Keep your mouth shut.

82
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,919
Stop gossiping.

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,240
It's what you did.

84
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,159
We're just telling the truth.

85
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,199
What is it?

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,759
Mr. Qin.

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,919
It's been a while. Get inside.

88
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,919
You should go.

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
Don't make others misunderstand,

90
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,879
Mr. Qin.

91
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,439
Mr. Qin, don't be fooled by her.

92
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,879
She had an improper relationship

93
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,800
with Vice President Qin.

94
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,919
She is trying to seduce you.

95
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,840
That's right.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Seduce me?

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,800
That's great.

98
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,240
Come on.

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,800
What...

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm full.

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,719
Duoduo, give me a chance!

102
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,159
See?

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,719
I'm the one chasing

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,639
and flattering her,

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,960
but she makes it so difficult.

106
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,520
Mr. Qin,

107
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,879
it was a misunderstanding.

108
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,639
As long as you resign by yourselves,

109
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,479
I won't take it to heart.

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:10,960
It's...

111
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,719
What should we do?

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,400
Duoduo.

113
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,079
Qin Qi, are you done with it?

114
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
I just helped you out.

115
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:21,920
Did I vent your anger?

116
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
I thought we agreed to

117
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,439
keep our relationship a secret.

118
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,519
I just said I was chasing after you.

119
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,079
I didn't mention that we live together

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
or that we are married.

121
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,480
Fine.

122
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,639
It's fake anyway.

123
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,720
Qin Lang!

124
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,079
Ask your uncle

125
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,439
not to transfer you

126
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,560
to the branch in nowhere.

127
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,519
After all, your last name is Qin.

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,639
This is so humiliating.

129
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,720
Humiliating?

130
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,319
Are you married to me

131
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,399
only for fame?

132
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,240
Why are shouting at me?

133
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,920
Are you still thinking about An Duoduo?

134
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,639
I'm too ashamed to see An Duoduo now,

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,079
and I'm regretful to marry you.

136
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,000
What did you say?

137
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,600
I said I'm regretful

138
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,399
to marry you.

139
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,639
You...

140
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,079
It must be her

141
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,360
who is trying to seduce Qin Lang.

142
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,759
An Duoduo,

143
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,439
I won't let you off.

144
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,680
Wait, what's this?

145
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,279
Congratulations!

146
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,839
(Congratulations to An Duoduo)
This is to celebrate the launch

147
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,319
of a new product designed
by An Duoduo in advance!

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,240
Thank you, everyone.

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,680
Thank Mr. Qin instead.

150
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,480
He prepared all these.

151
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,399
Congratulations, Duoduo.

152
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,519
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

153
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,959
What's going on?

154
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,040
Open it.

155
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,839
Mr. Qin is so nice.

156
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,839
Isn't it the necklace I designed?

157
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
This is the first one in production.

158
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,199
I give it to you as a memento.

159
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,800
Is it...

160
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,639
Is it appropriate?

161
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,199
He's so nice.

162
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,519
The rules are made by me.

163
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm so jealous.

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,720
Me too.

165
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,759
Nice. My taste is good.

166
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,240
Bad news!

167
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,000
Rongchang Jewelry's new necklace
launched today

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
looks exactly the same
as the one Duoduo designed.

169
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,000
No.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,759
That's impossible

171
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,000
(Rongchang Jewelry, New item)
They launched two hours earlier than we did,

172
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,240
and now they are posting
press releases everywhere,

173
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,839
claiming that we copied their design.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,879
Nonsense.

175
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,839
This is my design.

176
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,199
It is them who copied.

177
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,759
Mr. Wang,

178
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,160
ask the media

179
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,600
to delete all the relevant news.

180
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,959
No.

181
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,199
If we delete it now,

182
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
it's suggesting that we are guilty.

183
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,560
This is my design.

184
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm not afraid.

185
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,959
I have to prove myself.

186
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,600
But...

187
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,160
Alright.

188
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Just do what you need to do.

189
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,079
I will stand by your side.

190
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,279
Okay.
