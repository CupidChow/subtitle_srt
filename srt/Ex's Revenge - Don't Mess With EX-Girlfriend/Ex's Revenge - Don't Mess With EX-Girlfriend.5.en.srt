=Episode 5=

3
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:23,719
Indeed.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,800
Their barking makes my ears ache.

5
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:38,600
You!

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,759
What is it?

7
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,439
You didn't fall into it anyway.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,520
That's my gift for old madam Qin.

9
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,520
Old madam Qin?

10
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,320
Yes.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,280
She is Qin Qi's mother

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,759
and the former master of Qin Family.

13
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,920
She is from a illustrious family.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,840
She has an exquisite taste

15
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,600
and hates insolent people like you.

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,759
An Duoduo,

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,000
just you wait to be chased out.

18
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,519
Here is Old Madam Qin.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,920
Old Madam,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,319
my gift for you

21
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,519
was ruined by An Duoduo.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Hi.

23
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,400
Mom,

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,040
please allow me to introduce myself.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm your daughter-in-law,

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,799
An Duoduo.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,920
Daughter-in-law?

28
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:31,799
Who is she?

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,359
Where does this daughter-in-law
come from?

30
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,680
Yeah. We never heard of her.

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,680
What's wrong with this girl?

32
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,599
Who did you call "mom"?

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,719
Old madam Qin hasn't yet
acknowledged you.

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,760
Don't be rude.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Old Madam,

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
do you know that

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,959
Qin qi got married?

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,159
Or was he lying to us.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,480
Darling, why do you stand away from me?

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,519
Don't be shy.

41
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,719
Mom, of course we got married.

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,680
We got married very quickly.

43
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,640
Because we

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
fell in love at first sight

45
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,079
and decided to get married.

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
We are crazy for each other.

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,920
Right, Darling?

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,519
Indeed.

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,080
Very crazy.

50
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,280
You...

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,719
You two...

52
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,919
Don't be mad, Old Madam.

53
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,599
Uncle is being unreasonable.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,919
It's all the hussy's fault.

55
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,360
Qin Qi.

56
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,080
Do you have any respect for your mom?

57
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,000
How dare you hold back

58
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,879
such good news!

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,000
My daughter-in-law

60
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,439
is so pretty.

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,639
Of course, Mom.

62
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,000
Madam,

63
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,759
you really believe they're married?

64
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Why should I not believe my son

65
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,879
but you?

66
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,360
Niece-in-law,

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,319
watch your manners.

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,520
By the way,

69
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,000
who just called

70
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,639
my daughter-in-law a hussy?

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,199
Qin Family's rules stipulate

72
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,360
that newly-weds should kneel down
and kowtow to their elders.

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Qin Lang,

74
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,159
Qin Qi

75
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,280
is not only the master

76
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,479
but also your uncle.

77
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,840
Did you perform kowtowing rituals

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,520
to your uncle and aunt?

79
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,800
What?

80
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,840
Rituals can't be overlooked.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,879
Kneel down.

82
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,159
Kneel down.

83
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,639
Uncle. Aunt.

84
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,800
We wish you good health

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,920
and happiness.

86
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:27,879
Good girl.

87
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,079
Mrs. Qin, how gorgeous the gown

88
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,800
you're wearing today.

89
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,040
Thanks.

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,639
Mrs. Qin,

91
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,079
may I have your contact information?

92
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,040
Excuse me.

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,759
For all these years,

94
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,920
I almost thought

95
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,240
you would live alone for a lifetime.

96
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,639
I was wrong.

97
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,839
Thank God.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,920
You have decided?

99
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,800
Mom.

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,480
But she isn't interested in my wealth

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
or my power.

102
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,199
She has not accepted me yet.

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
You useless.

104
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,639
You don't even know
how to chase after a girl?

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,240
Mom,

106
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,040
are you angry with me

107
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,959
for bringing her here?

108
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,040
It depends.

109
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,360
Secretary Zhang,

110
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,720
sign up for a course for me.

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,040
I want to learn

112
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,439
how to raise my grandchildren.

113
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,800
Yes, Old Madam.

114
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,800
It's such an amazing day!

115
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,720
Since you had fun today,

116
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
how about being my wife
and having fun every day?

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,360
No, thanks.

118
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,399
Why not pay me off first?

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,040
I need money to pay my rent.

120
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,759
Thanks, boss.

121
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:11,720
This way.

122
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:12,720
Come in, please.

123
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,319
How do you like it?

124
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,839
It's pretty good.

125
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,920
Are you sure the rent is only 5000 yuan?

126
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,240
Is there something wrong

127
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,759
with its fengshui?

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
No way!

129
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,199
The owner just had his 6th child.

130
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,240
There is not enough room here.

131
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,879
So he is eager to get a bigger house.

132
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
6 children!

133
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,240
Now I understand.

134
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,079
If you don't like it,

135
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,600
there are people waiting in line.

136
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,000
Wait, wait.

137
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,079
I'll rent it.

138
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,360
I will.

139
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,399
Well,

140
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,879
if you'll allow me to pay for two months
with only one month's deposit,

141
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll pay you right away.

142
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,920
Deal!

143
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,680
Here you are.

144
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,240
Sign here.

145
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,879
No problem.

146
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:58,275
(An Duoduo)

147
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,439
OK.

148
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,199
Money.

149
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:04,720
10,000 yuan.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,519
There you go.

151
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:10,959
OK.

152
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,800
I wish you all the best then.

153
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,399
Goodbye.

154
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,120
We meet again.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
