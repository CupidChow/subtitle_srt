3
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,359
Now you understand, my dear.

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,640
An Duoduo did this to you!

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,840
If not for her,

6
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,399
you wouldn't be lying here.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,079
If not for her,

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,039
I wouldn't have been fired.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm the daughter-in-law of the Qins.

10
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm the famous designer!

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,320
Be it my family, education or looks,

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,960
how am I not comparable to
that bumpkin?

13
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,280
How dare you divorce me!

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,960
I'm so good to you, my dear.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,079
Yet you never worked hard.

16
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,320
You never appreciated me.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,000
I had only wanted to scare An Duoduo

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,239
but you had to ruin my plan.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,359
I'm really disappointed in you.

20
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,319
Luckily, I've left myself a way out.

21
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,000
I got a phone card
with An Duoduo's ID number

22
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,280
in the first place

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,239
and used it to contact the driver.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,439
Everything was paid in cash

25
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,480
which was sent from

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,200
the company's address
in An Duoduo's name.

27
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,760
Even if they found the driver,

28
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,200
they'd never trace it back to me.

29
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,920
This time, she's in for good.

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,959
My dear,

31
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,120
you'll belong to me

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,159
forever.

33
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,719
Qin Lang.

34
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,519
You're awake?

35
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,959
What are you doing?

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,200
Save me, Qin Lang!

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,959
Li Weiwei,

38
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,159
it's really you!

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,079
How wise, Miss An.

40
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,959
If you hadn't come up with
the plan to play along,

41
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,959
we wouldn't have caught
the real culprit.

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,200
Boss,

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,280
how was my acting?

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
A little too much.

45
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,480
Li Weiwei.

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,599
Do you want to turn yourself in

47
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,280
or should we take you to the police?

48
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,159
I don't know what you're talking about!

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,759
What you said just now

50
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,000
has been recorded.

51
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,319
You hired the driver
and tried to harm others.

52
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,360
You should come with us.

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,800
You have no proof of me
hiring the driver.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Let go of me!

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,840
I can prove it.

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,639
I heard everything

57
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,879
when you called the driver.

58
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,439
Qin Lang, I'm your wife!

59
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,719
Don't you care about

60
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,680
our marriage at all?

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,280
Weiwei, you need to stop now!

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,240
It was not my fault!

63
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,199
It was An Duoduo's!

64
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,599
Let me go!

65
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,039
An Duoduo, I'll never forgive you!

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,319
Let him rest.

67
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,319
We should leave now.

68
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,680
Don't be afraid. It just looks scary.

69
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,919
Who told you to save me?

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,039
I'm sturdy!

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,719
A stab or two won't kill me!

72
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,759
But you...

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,960
Your skin is so delicate.

74
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,000
What if it leaves a scar?

75
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,199
Are you worrying about me?

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
I just don't want to owe you anything.

77
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,120
You don't owe me, Duoduo.

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,919
I'm happy that I can

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,360
protect you this one time!

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,159
Does it hurt?

81
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,199
No.

82
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,159
Ouch, ouch!

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,159
It hurts!

84
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,480
Be gentler.

85
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,759
Does it still hurt?

86
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,920
Myabe it won't hurt
if you blow some more.

87
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,439
Y...You're really troublesome.

88
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,439
What? Lead Designer?

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,079
No, you're a special person now.

90
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,439
It's just

91
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,360
the title of a regular designer

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
won't fit you anymore.

93
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,959
I don't need any special treatment.

94
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,839
I just want to be a regular designer!

95
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,959
I'll realize my dream
with my capabilities,

96
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,040
not with my status as the boss's wife!

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,959
No, then...

98
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,319
If not the Lead Designer,

99
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,519
are you trying to take my place
to be the HR Manager?

100
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm done for.

101
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:17,920
Doomed.

102
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,759
My job's at risk!

103
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:28,875
(Qin's Jewelry Chat Group)

104
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
(Qin's Jewelry Chat Group)
Look! Duoduo's so elegant!

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,399
That's right!

106
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:35,959
You just know

107
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,279
she'll be

108
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:36,879
a great designer!

109
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah! She's awesome!

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,000
Go for it!

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,480
How dare you

112
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
call her by her name?

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,519
Recall your messages!

114
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:45,850
("Mr. Wang" changed the group name to
"Wishing Mr. and Mrs Qin a Lasting Marriage")

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,040
Duoduo?

116
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm tired! I'm turning in!

117
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,920
Why are you still up?

118
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,600
I... I'm about to sleep.

119
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,519
Good night!

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,560
Duoduo.

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,800
When will you stop playing dumb?

122
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,720
I...

123
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,959
I'm not playing dumb.

124
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,319
You know I like you.

125
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,079
I...

126
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
I like you.

127
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,160
I've always liked you.

128
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,000
From the moment we got married,

129
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,360
I've never thought about splitting up.

130
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,399
I... I think...

131
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,959
it's better to take this matter

132
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,839
slow and easy.

133
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,279
G... Good night!

134
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,399
How about this?

135
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,399
From this moment onward,

136
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,199
go on three dates with me.

137
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,920
If you still feel nothing

138
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,600
towards me after three dates,

139
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,839
I'll let go.

140
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,879
I...

141
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,959
No, I mean...

142
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,360
I'm open to trying.

143
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,720
But that

144
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,959
