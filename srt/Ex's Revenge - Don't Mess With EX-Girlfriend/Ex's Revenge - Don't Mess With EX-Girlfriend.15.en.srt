of the next auction item is 5,000 yuan.

Ten thousand.

Twenty thousand.

Fifty thousand.

Ten million.

Ten million.

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,159
Ten million!

(Number 3)
Are you insane?

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,280
Ten million, going once.

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,000
Ten million, going twice.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,320
Ten million, going three times.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,799
Congratulations, Mr. Qin.

17
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,439
(Mr. Qin, you spent huge amounts
of money for your wife.)

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,079
will you come up
and say something to us?

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,399
(It's Mr. Qin.)

21
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,359
(That's not surprising then.)

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,599
Although this pair
of earrings is small,

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,079
it represents the efforts of my wife.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,120
She came to the city
from a small village

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,599
and has gotten where she is
with her own efforts and talent.

26
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,799
It's hard.

27
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,319
I hope I can help

28
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,560
those girls from poor villages

29
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,799
go to a bigger world,

30
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,560
so they can change their lives

31
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,840
with tireless efforts

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,040
and realize their dreams

33
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,959
as my wife did.

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,439
(Good.)

35
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,960
(Well said.)

36
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,000
(Yeah.)

37
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,240
(Well said.)

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
(It's so moving.)

39
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,639
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,919
That's ten million!

41
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,159
Don't feel pressured.

42
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,159
I intended to do charity
in the first place.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,759
Now I also promoted your design.

44
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,199
It's a win-win.

45
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,520
But this will make more people think

46
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,439
that I use you
to advance my career.

47
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,080
Duoduo,

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,759
even if I didn't bid for it,

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,280
others would also bid ten times

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,960
or even twenty times the price
for your jewelry.

51
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,159
You just lack an opportunity to be seen.

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,120
So what if you are criticized

53
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,479
or expelled from the competition?

54
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,960
You should believe in your talent.

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,039
Sooner or later,

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,240
you'll shine.

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,560
You...

58
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,600
are willing to believe me?

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,800
To me,

60
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,199
you are already the best.

61
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,600
Why is there a moon in your palm?

62
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,759
This is to remember

63
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,000
a very important person.

64
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,240
It's not your ex-girlfriend, is it?

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,000
Duoduo, actually I...

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,560
Mr. Qin.

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
You've really spent big money.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,000
But your wife's design

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,000
is worth ten million yuan indeed.

(2022 Charity Auction)

71
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,639
Thanks for your appreciation.

72
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,160
You're welcome.

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,959
I really look forward
to your wife's future designs.

74
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,240
She will surely excel.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,560
Thank you.

76
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,519
(I heard that he had a crush
on a girl before.)

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,399
(He was smitten by her
and insisted on marrying her.)

78

a very important person.

81
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
It's just a moon.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,439
I also have one.

83
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,839
It's so annoying.

84
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,040
I'll go to bed.
