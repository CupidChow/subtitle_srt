=Episode 11=

3
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,600
Qin Lang, hang in there!

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,239
Doctor, please save him!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,120
Please, you must save him!

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,479
Mom! Here!

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,280
Be careful!

8
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,479
Qin Lang! Qin Lang!

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,479
How's Qin Lang?

10
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,640
Any family members?

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,560
Doctor, I am.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,679
My son's alright.

13
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,679
He's alright, right?

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,760
The patient's vitals have stabilized.

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,319
But he sustained multiple fractures

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,439
and a blow to his head.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,159
He is currently in deep coma.

18
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,719
It's difficult to tell
when he'll wake up.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
Do you mean Qin Lang

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,319
might never wake up?

21
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,040
That's uncertain.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,079
Mom!

23
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,400
It's you! All because of you!

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,840
Are you alright?

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,480
Say

26
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,239
I hadn't

27
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,599
hung up on Qin Lang

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,680
but had agreed to meet him instead,

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
would he not have...

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,200
Duoduo.

31
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,879
This wasn't your fault.

32
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,239
It was an accident.

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,319
No!

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,799
It wasn't an accident!

35
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,200
Focus on driving!

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,120
My baby.

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,680
What happened to you?

38
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,000
Wake up now.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,879
What am I supposed to do?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,240
Mom! Qin Lang's accident

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,639
is just too strange!

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,240
What do you mean?

43
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,960
Qin Lang suddenly asked for
a divorce with me yesterday.

44
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,639
He said Qin Qi and An Duoduo

45
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,919
had been picking on him.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,719
He didn't want me to get involved,

47
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,360
so he wanted to break up with me.

48
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,439
What did you say?

49
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,080
Mom!

50
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,479
Qin Lang is
a proper descendant of the Qins!

51
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,439
Yet because of An Duoduo,

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,759
not only was he unable to
perform in the company,

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
but he was even transferred away.

54
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,159
That woman has gone mad!

55
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,919
She's got uncle hooked on one hand

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,879
while still pestering Qin Lang
on the other!

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,080
Mom!

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Qin Lang refused her,

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,520
so she hated him

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
and tried to kill him!

61
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,520
Mom!

62
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,680
Mom, look!

63
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,879
(Call Log)
Before the accident,

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
his last call

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,080
was to An Duoduo!

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,560
An Duoduo was the one
who asked him out!

67
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,840
Mom!

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,240
You must avenge Qin Lang!

69
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,000
That loose woman!

70
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,439
I'll never let her off!

71
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,240
I didn't say this
because I was traumatized!

72
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,879
It wasn't an accident!

73
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,960
Here, have some water first.

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,439
The security cameras were broken.

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,240
What?

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,240
The cameras were broken?

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,680
Yes. They are broken.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,599
The cameras in that area
happened to be malfunctioned.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
They didn't get that vehicle at all.

80
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,039
What about the plate number I told you?

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,919
I checked it, the car was illegal.

82
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,199
The plate number is a dead end.

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,120
Something is wrong indeed.

84
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,120
I must find out the truth!

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,759
Duoduo, I'll go with you.

86
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,360
You're the one who ran him over.

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,599
How dare you ask me for money?

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,639
Don't think you can threaten me.

89
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,400
Take the deposit and scram

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
if you know better.

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,599
Report me?

92
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,680
Go ahead.

93
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,840
Note this down.

94
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,879
My name is An Duoduo.

95
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,000
Is this really necessary?

96
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,399
Protect Madam!

97
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,920
That car was obviously coming at you.

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
I cannot put you in danger.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,680
No...

100
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,800
From now on,

101
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,680
you must stay close to me 24/7.

102
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,600
Since it was coming at me,

103
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,279
wouldn't I be a better bait

104
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
if I were alone?

105
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,160
Duoduo!

106
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,375
(Liu Yuqin)

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,079
Hello?

108
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,680
Duoduo.

109
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
Qin Lang is awake!

110
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,279
Qin Lang is awake?

111
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,360
Duoduo!

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,519
Duoduo!

113
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,639
Duoduo, you're here!

114
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,680
Come here.

115
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,279
Um... Didn't you say Qin Lang's awake?

116
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,800
The moment I said your name,

117
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,439
he stirred.

118
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,240
That's why I asked you to come.

119
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,519
I thought that if you could talk to him,

120
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,800
he might wake up.

121
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Come over.

122
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,319
Qin Lang.

123
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,680
Come closer.

124
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,920
Qin Lang.

125
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,439
You wicked woman!

126
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,439
Pay with your life!

127
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,920
Are you out of your mind?

128
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,519
Stop pretending to be kind!

129
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,639
You're the one who tried to kill my son!

130
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,759
We country people

132
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,800
are strong and react quickly.

133
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,800
Sneak attacks won't work.

134
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,639
You!

135
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,279
Mr. Qin.

136
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,360
Help!

137
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,279
You...

138
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,680
You harmed my son

139
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,720
and are now teaming up to bully me!

140
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,240
Is there even justice?

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,600
She tried to harm my wife with a knife.

142
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,439
Call the police.

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,439
Mr. Qin, the driver was arrested.

144
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,000
However...

145
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,920
However what?

146
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,279
He was indeed instructed to do so.

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,519
But he said

148
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,759
that the one who hired him

149
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,839
was An Duoduo.

150
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,680
Me?

151
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,920
It can't be!

152
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,879
How can it be me?

153
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,000
We have to bring you to the police.

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,680
It's not me!

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,759
Don't you dare touch her!

157
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
It was you indeed!

158
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
An Duoduo!

159
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,560
It's not her.

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,319
Take her away!
