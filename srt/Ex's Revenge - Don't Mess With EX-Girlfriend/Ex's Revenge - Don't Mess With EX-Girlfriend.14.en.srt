Mr. Qin.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,480
Please take a look.

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you.

Are you free this afternoon?

10
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,640
Go somewhere with me.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,320
I don't want to go.

12
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,430
The second time.

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,480
A chance to get some refreshment.

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,070
Alright.

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,350
I think it's pretty nice here.

16
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,430
Look at the environment.

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,680

to come visit us more often.)

(2022 Charity Auction)
Charity auction?

19
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,950
I don't like these occasions.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,200
Let's leave.

21
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,150
Are you sure?

22
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,120
(Look at this one.)

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,840
There is also jewelry for auction?

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
(I want to bid for it today.)

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,470
Please wait for me.

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
(I heard there are famous paintings too.)

27
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,910
(What did you bring)

28
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,120
(for today's charity auction?)

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,520
(A blue diamond antique necklace.)

30
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,240
(Mrs. Xu, you are so generous.)

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,080
(Is it the piece
that the British princess ever wore?)

32
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,870
It's all for charity, right?

33
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,560
Yes, indeed.

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,470
I wonder what Mrs. Qin

35
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,910
brought today?

36
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,710
A pheasant can never be a phoenix.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,870
It tastes so good.

38
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,120
Look how petty she is.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,150
I think she would be reluctant

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,470
to donate even 100 yuan.

41
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,280
Exactly.

42
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,030
If I remember correctly,

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,750
you

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,630
are a part of the Qin family, right?

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,710
Speaking to the wife
of the head of the family this way,

46
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,240
is it appropriate?

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,470
Although my husband
is of a younger generation than Qin Qi,

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,590
we watched him grow up.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,120
I heard that he had a crush

50
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,080
on a girl before.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,590
He was smitten by her
and insisted on marrying her.

52
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,400
But see? He's with you now.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,240
Men are all the same.

54
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,000
They change one day
but no one knows when.

55
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,910
Don't take yourself too seriously.

56
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,430
Does who he likes

57
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,240
have anything to do with you?

58
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,520
Since you've already said
that you're a junior,

59
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,960
then you better not interfere
with your seniors' business.

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,120
You...

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
What?

62
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,910
Since you're of the Qin family,

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,520
you should address me as "ma'am".

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
Don't get riled up. Let's go.

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,120
(Today's charity auction
is about to begin.)

66
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,630
(First of all,
thank you for your generosity.)

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,080
(You have brought us)

68
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,310
(many rare treasures.)

69
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,630
(Love ignites hope.)

70
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,520
The auction is about to begin.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,430
See if

72
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,470
there is anything you like.

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
(A warm welcome to all guests)

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,270
(who are participating in the auction.)

75
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,360
(Our charity auction this time)

76
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,800
(depends on everyone here)

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,430
(raising your paddles)

78
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,240
(to monetize all donated items)

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
(so as to bring together
the power of love)

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,950
(to help those in need.)

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,600
(All proceeds from today's auction)

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,070
(will go towards helping poor girls
go to school.)

83
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,920
(Number 1)
The first piece we're auctioning today

84
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,360
is a painting
by the famous painter Bixujiasuo.

85
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,950
Opening bid, 1 million.

86
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,390
This...

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
One million?

88
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,040
It's this expensive?

89
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,360
Look how petty she is.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
Bumpkin.

91
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,240
Two million.

92
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,480
Okay.

93
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,160
Two million, going once.

94
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,720
Two million, going twice.

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,040
Two million, going three times.

96
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,560
Sold!

97
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,750
The item we are going to auction next

98
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,800
is a blue diamond antique diamond necklace

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,430
from the British royal family
in the Middle Ages.

100
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
The opening bid is three million.

101
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,500
(Number 2)

102
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:32,830
Do you like it?

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,680
The design is too old-fashioned.

104
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,120
I think
it's a waste of such fine jewels.

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,190
What do bumpkins know about jewelry?

106
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,870
Five million.

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,560
Okay. Five million, going once.

108
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,800
Five million, going twice.

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,120
Five million, going three times,

110
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,480
Sold!

111
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,870
Mrs. Xu, it's your husband.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,270
What a display of affection.

113
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,270
Such happiness.

114
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,680
It's all for charity.

115
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,240
Congratulations, Mrs. Xu.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
The next item

117
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
comes from Mrs. Qin.

118
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,630
Me?

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,270
A pair of earrings designed by Mrs. Qin.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
The opening bid is five thousand yuan.

121
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,800
Why did you choose my earrings

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
for the auction?

123
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,360
Don't worry.

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,950
(So cheap.)

125
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,070
(Right. Donating something
that's only worth five thousand?)

126
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,870
Five thousand yuan?

127
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,120
Five thousand yuan?

128
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
But I think they're pretty.

129
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,630
(Interesting.)

130
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,160
(Roadside shops pricing.)

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,800
Ten thousand.

132
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,830
Twenty thousand.

133
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,720
Fifty thousand.

134
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,240
Are you seeing this?

135
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,510
It's going for fifty thousand.

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,480
(They're indeed worth that price.)

137
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,360
Of course your design is the best.

138
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,120
A hundred thousand.

139
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,680
(The design is quite nice.)

140
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,720
(Is the price a little low?)

141
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,040
Ten million.

142
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,830
Ten million!

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Ten million?

144
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
How is that possible?

145
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,720
Ten million. Ten million!

146
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,870
Ten million.

147
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,270
From five thousand to ten million.

148
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,870
You...

149
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,070
Are you crazy?

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,720
(They're worth the price.)

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
