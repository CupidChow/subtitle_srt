=Episode 18=

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,239
Why aren't your parents here with you?

4
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,760
They aren't in the country.

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,120
How pitiful.

6
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,039
I thought I was the only one 
without parents.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,439
But I'm better off than you.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,640
I still have my grandma.

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:37,600
Oh right,

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,200
grandma is being discharged soon.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
So I won't be able 
to stay with you anymore.

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,159
Actually, I'm leaving the country 
tomorrow.

13
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,399
What if there is a power outage

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,280
again?

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,640
Look.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,280
This moon is the same as 
the one behind my ear.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,600
It will always be with you 
in place of me.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,120
What can I do for you in return?

19
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,519
How about you promise yourself to me?

20
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,239
They say that on TV, 
meaning you will marry me

21
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,439
and always play with me.

22
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,439
How about it?

23
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,079
Pinky, pinky, whoever tells a lie,

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,239
will sink down to the bad place
and never rise up again.

25
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,879
So...

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,719
this moon was from me?

27
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,280
After you left

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,640
I was reluctant to wipe it off 
for a long time.

29
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,799
I kept redrawing it.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,079
Redrawing it.

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,719
Later, I secretly found a tattooist 
to turn it into a tattoo.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,680
But why does Jenny 

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,039
have one too?

34
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,879
She kept fantasizing about
being the person I love.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,840
That's why she got herself 
the same tattoo

36
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,639
to lie to herself.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
So that means...

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
she is the replacement?

39
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,680
No. No one can replace you.

40
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,840
You are the only one I love.

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,919
But we were just children.

42
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,280
We didn't know what love was.

43
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,000
I almost forgot about you, you know?

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,159
But...

45
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,319
I never forget you.

46
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,360
Then why...?

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,319
Why did you

48
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,360
never look for me?

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,919
Duoduo, I didn't expect 
you'd go to college...

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,319
No.

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Duoduo, congratulations on
getting into college.

52
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,400
Duoduo, congratulations on
getting into college.

53
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,520
Young Master.

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,000
We're here.

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,639
You just got back to China,
why aren't you going home?

56
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,960
Your mother will be angry.

57
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,879
Duoduo.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,719
Pass the ball!

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,319
Over here!

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,159
Pass it to me!

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Duoduo, pass it to me!

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,800
Catch the ball!

63
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,599
Is she there?

64
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,639
Go on!

65
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,080
Good pass!

66
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,280
Come with me.

67
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,120
She...

68
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,599
She's coming.

69
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,159
Duoduo, where are you going?

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,039
Duoduo!

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,199
We haven't finished our practice yet!

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,280
Watch out over there.

73
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,800
Why are you so late?

74
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,319
You're always late.

75
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,280
I...

76
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,560
I lost track of time.

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,639
Please don't be angry.

78
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,960
Let's go now.

79
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:06,959
Over here!

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,688
Catch it!

81
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:10,093
Good one!

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,879
Let's go.

83
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,279
Off we go.

84
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,199
Boss, will you be attending 
Qin Lang's wedding?

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,279
I'm busy. I don't have time.

86
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,759
But I heard

87
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,240
that Qin Lang is going 
to marry someone else.

88
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,375
(Bear it)

89
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:16,050
(Unbearable)

90
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,639
I...

91
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,319
You what?

92
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,120
You didn't look for me, did you?

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,040
(Duoduo.)

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
(You were always in my world.)

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,439
(Like the moon in the sky.)

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,959
(You never left.)

97
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,079
So...

98
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,319
when did you

99
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,399
fall in love with me?

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Actually, I have always...

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,720
I don't care.

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,199
We made

103
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,759
a pinky promise when we were kids.

104
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,800
You have to marry me.

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,639
Hubby.

106
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
What did you just call me?

107
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,720
Mr. Qin!

108
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,879
What's wrong?

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,879
