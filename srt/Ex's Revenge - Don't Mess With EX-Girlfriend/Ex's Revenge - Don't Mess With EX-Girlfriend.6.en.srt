=Episode 6=

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,079
Tell me exactly

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,559
why you are here.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,159
Come on!

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,280
Is there any problem for an owner

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,799
to stay in his own house?

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,560
Any problem?

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:37,960
Please understand one thing,

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,840
now that I have rented this house,

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,640
it's my call.

12
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:42,880
Fine.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,880
Hostess of the house

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,799
can decide everything in the future.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,719
Turn left!

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,640
Get out right now.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,039
There is no…

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,640
"future".

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,000
It is clearly stipulated in the contract

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,159
that the tenant should share the house
with the owner.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,879
It's not true.

22
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:16,125
(Party B shall share the house
with the owner during rental period.)

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,439
I want to terminate the contract.

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,719
No rent is refunded
for any breach of contract.

25
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,200
You…

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,239
What are you laughing at?

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
Take things as they come.

28
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,760
Welcome home,

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,879
honey.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Alright!

31
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,200
Only three months,

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,799
it's not so hard to get through it.

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Look!

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,639
There is a moon-shaped mark
behind my ear,

35
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,840
so

36
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,360
I can give out light even in the dark.

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,280
Don't be afraid!
I will be here with you.

38
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,599
Good morning!

39
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,280
Morning!

40
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,680
You now look different as a designer.

41
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,120
Don't forget your old friend
when you get rich.

42
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,599
Of course I won't, my dear!

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,680
Hi!

44
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,479
Had you seen Li Weiwei when she came

45
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,479
(Qin's Jewelry)
to collect things yesterday,

46
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,120
you would've felt greatly relieved.

47
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,639
I regret not having recorded it.

48
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,879
Don't talk about her.

49
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,039
Let me show you my office.

50
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,599
Let's go!

51
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:46,919
OK!

52
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,400
Duoduo!

53
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,639
I still have some work to do.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
Why are you here,

55
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,240
Nephew?

56
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,680
Duoduo,

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
did you really get married to my uncle?

58
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,080
The elders' business has

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
nothing to do with you.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,319
Just come to the point,

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,240
or get out of here.

62
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,199
Duoduo!

63
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,159
Duoduo,

64
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,680
I didn't expect

65
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,560
Weiwei would have stolen your draft.

66
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,879
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,439
What a surprise

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,720
to hear the young master Qin
say sorry to me.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,040
I admit

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,680
I was blinded
by Weiwei's gentleness before,

71
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,519
so I…

72
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,160
Duoduo,

73
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,360
I was wrong.

74
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,160
I should have trusted you.

75
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,680
I shouldn't have been obsessed with her.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,079
I sincerely apologize to you.

77
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:43,959
Sorry!

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,639
Your apology can't make a difference.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,040
It's better to make it up
than just saying sorry.

80
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

81
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,319
This is the key to the house
I bought for us.

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,560
I'll give it to you now.

83
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,759
I don't expect you to forgive me,

84
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,600
but I promise that I'll give you a…

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,560
Crazy!

86
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,519
Duoduo!

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Duoduo!

88
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,879
I'll try my best
to make it up to you, Duoduo.

89
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,879
These are keys to the properties
under my name,

90
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,439
36 in total,

91
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,879
covering seven countries.

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you

93
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,360
showing off your wealth to me?

94
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,319
You can choose any one of these

95
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,639
if you like.

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,360
No, thanks.

97
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,360
I pretended to be your wife for one day

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
only to get paid 10,000 yuan.

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
If I take any one of them,

100
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,399
I'll have to pretend my whole life.

101
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,959
It's okay for me.

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,639
Not okay for me.

103
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,639
Don't forget our agreement, Mr. Qin.

104
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:51,920
I…

105
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,680
can only help you for three months.

106
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,120
(Duoduo,)

107
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,040
(I was wrong.)

108
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,439
(I shouldn't have been obsessed with her.)

109
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
(I should have trusted you.)

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,480
(I…)

111
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
(I'm sorry.)

112
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:13,959
(Duoduo,)

113
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:14,959
(I was wrong.)

114
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
(I'm sorry.)

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,120
(Duoduo,)

116
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:18,920
(sorry!)

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,480
(I'll try my best to make it up to you.)

118
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,839
I have a plan,

119
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,319
Secretary Zhang.

120
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,160
Duoduo,

121
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,839
big news!

122
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
We'll have a new CEO.

123
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,720
Qin Lang was appointed to another site.

124
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,399
Then who is the new one?

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't know.

126
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,439
Good day, Mr. Qin!

127
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,920
Good day, Mr. Qin!

128
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,920
With the president of the Group here,

129
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,040
we're going to make big profit.

130
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,920
How charming!

131
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:12,839
Indeed.

132
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,720
Designer An Duoduo!

133
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,800
How handsome he is!

134
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,120
Yes, you're right.

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
So charming.

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,920
Look! He is so charming.

137
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,959
I want Mr. Qin to treat me like that.

138
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,759
Me, too.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,800
You have dropped your bag.

140
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,959
Why would you be the CEO here?

141
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,279
Surprise? I'm here for you.

142
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,959
Mr. Qin is really a great boss.

143
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,279
Thanks, Mr. Qin! Thanks, Mr. Qin!

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,600
To celebrate An Duoduo's promotion,

145
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,040
we'll have dinner together

146
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,279
and it's on me.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,079
Thanks, Mr. Qin!

148
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,480
Thanks, Mr. Qin!

149
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,120
Thanks, Mr. Qin!
