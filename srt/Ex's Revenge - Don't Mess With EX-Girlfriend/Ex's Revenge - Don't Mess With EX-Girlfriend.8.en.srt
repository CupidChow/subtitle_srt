3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,519
Do we have to take the bus?

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,839
A mountain road is dangerous.

5
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,480
It's safer to take the bus
than driving by yourself.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,519
The bus is quite comfortable.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,240
It's just...

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,359
A little bit crowded.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,039
It's not just crowded with people.

10
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,079
Bear with it. We're almost there.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,560
It's pecking me.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,399
It's okay.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,439
I'm here.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,200
Get off me.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,750
My chicken!

(No. 613, Ridu Village, Xinhe County)

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,000
It's quite a long way to get here.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,359
It must be hard for you.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,880
It's alright.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
That's strange.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,480
I remember putting it here.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,079
You haven't been back for a long time?

23
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,120
My parents left early.

24
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,079
It was just me and my grandma.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,560
After my grandma passed away,

26
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,480
I'm by myself.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,959
Living by yourself

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,079
all these years must be tough.

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,879
There was a grant program

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,480
in my school.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,640
A very kind-hearted person

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,079
had sponsored my study all the way.

33
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,560
I'm really grateful to him.

34
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,680
Hopefully,

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,040
one day I can stand in front of him

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,799
and proudly tell him,

37
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:56,879
"See,

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm officially

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
a jewelry designer now."

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,799
He's already seen it.

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,159
Actually,

42
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,319
I'm very lucky.

43
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,240
Think about it.

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,039
I have friends.
I have a dream and a goal.

45
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,719
So,

46
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,680
I don't feel lonely at all.

47
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,840
Right, my friend!

48
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:32,270
(No. 620, Ridu Village, Xinhe County)

49
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,520
What are we doing here?

50
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,240
Surely we're here

51
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,919
to see my best childhood friend.

52
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,680
Have you...

53
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,000
Duoduo!

54
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,000
Shanshan!

55
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,639
Shanshan!

56
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,719
You came back without telling me
in advance?

57
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,120
It's a sudden decision.

58
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,039
This is...

59
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,199
This is Wang Shanshan,

60
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,680
my childhood friend.

61
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,240
This is...

62
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,520
Your boyfriend?

63
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,360
A normal friend.

64
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,840
Just a normal friend.

65
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,639
Did you come back because you missed me?

66
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,800
Not really.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm here to find something.

68
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,800
The sketchbook
you used to keep carefully, right?

69
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,280
How do you know?

70
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,800
Before you left, you handed it to me

71
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,120
and made sure

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,039
I would keep it well.

73
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,280
It's still kept

74
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,120
in the most important place at my house.

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,120
That's great.
I need it back right now.

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,639
If you want the sketchbook back,

77
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,199
you have to promise me one thing.

78
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,639
What is it?

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
Be my girlfriend.

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

81
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,400
Let's go. Time to eat.

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Let me tell you,

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
you are lucky today.

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,120
Really?

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,319
It's all your favorite food.

86
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,520
Then I will enjoy it.

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,879
Of course!

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,360
Let's go.

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,240
Here, Duoduo.

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,039
Try this one.

91
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,599
Thank you.

92
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,520
And this.

93
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,520
The pork knuckle is coming.

94
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,800
Duoduo, you need to eat more.

95
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

96
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,800
This is your favorite
braised pork knuckle.

97
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,719
It's too oily. Not healthy for you.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,919
Your friend seems a bit officious.

99
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,279
Shanshan, cut it out.

100
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,800
I need the sketchbook immediately.

101
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,480
Just give it to me now.

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,160
Duoduo,

103
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,879
I've been loving you

104
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,879
since grade one in primary school.

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,120
You love me?

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
You have to give me an answer.

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,560
Here.

108
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,120
She has nothing to say.

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,920
Why do you say that?

110
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,480
Because I'm her...

111
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,160
My old colleague.

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,279
Colleague.

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,879
I don't care who you are.

114
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,600
You have to drink
if you want the sketchbook back.

115
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Qin Qi, are you alright?

116
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,120
Duoduo, your friend is interesting.

117
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,120
Don't call her Duoduo.

118
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,439
Who allows you to call her Duoduo?

119
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,439
I've been calling her Duoduo
for over 20 years.

120
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:28,879
What's the problem?

121
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,720
Duoduo.

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,600
Duoduo.

123
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,439
Stop it.

124
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,600
Duoduo.

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,360
No!

126
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,240
Duoduo is my...

127
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,759
Your colleague.

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,000
An Duoduo is my wife!

129
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,560
Go. Go to daddy.

130
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,959
Go to your daddy.

131
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,279
Daddy.

132
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,680
Come.

133
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,519
Come here, Bao.

134
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,279
Look at him.

135
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,040
He's a good kid.

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,600
You have a...

137
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,319
Bro, this one is to you.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Duoduo.

139
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,879
Come here, Bao.

140
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,519
Brother.

141
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,319
Here. Come here.

142
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,000
Today,

143
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,720
you barely passed the test.

144
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,959
As a man,

145
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,199
you have to take responsibility.

146
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,959
Right.

147
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,240
You have to
take care of Duoduo from now on.

148
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,639
Promise?

149
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,199
Promise.

150
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:44,759
Also,

151
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,959
once you are married,

152
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,120
as a husband, you have to follow the moral code.

153
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,600
Sure.

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,360
Hand in all your pay to your wife.

155
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,519
I will.

156
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,480
Just like me, alright?

157
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,480
Sure. Okay.

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,120
Brother Shan,

159
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,600
this one is to you.

160
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,800
Duoduo,

161
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,800
I think your husband is a good man.

162
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,519
You should treasure him.

163
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
He is good.

164
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
We are almost there.

165
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,839
Are you alright?

166
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,120
Be careful. This way.

167
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,950
This is it.

168
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
Isn't it the same?

169
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,000
When I was young,

170
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,040
I always felt lonely.

171
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,879
And every time I felt lonely,

172
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
I would come to play under this tree.

173
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
So whether I was happy

174
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,879
or sad,

175
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,720
this tree was with me.

176
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,439
Later my grandma was sick,

177
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,160
I went to town
to see the doctor with her.

178
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,040
I was worried every day,
and I missed home a lot.

179
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,310
So I would draw this tree every day.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,160
Later,

181
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,750
my grandma left.

182
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,480
But it was okay,

183
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,959
There was this tree.

184
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,360
It is still here.

185
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm still here as well.

186
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,839
No.

187
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,160
Qin Qi, you are drunk.

188
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,879
Duoduo,

189
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,040
don't push me away.

190
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,480
I don't want to be your normal friend,

191
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
or your colleague.

192
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,440
Let me take the place of this tree,

193
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
and be with you forever.

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,679
But...

195
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,440
