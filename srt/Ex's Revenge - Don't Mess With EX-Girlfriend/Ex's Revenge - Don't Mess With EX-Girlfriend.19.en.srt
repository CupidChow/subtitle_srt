(Haizhou News)
This morning, a photo of Qin Qi

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,519
hugging Jenny Wu
in a restaurant was leaked,

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,199
which indicates that Qin Qi is
actually in love with someone else.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,800
People concerned have also confirmed

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,320
that Qin Qi is still unmarried.

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,320
The marriage of him 
and An Duoduo was nothing

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,600
but a diversion to take
the public's attention 

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
away from

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,439
the serious capital chain problem 
of Qin Group.

12
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,200
Qin Qi, is that true?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,280
You not only deceived the public,

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,439
but also every one of our Qin family.

15
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,000
How stupid you are.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
What? the news is real?

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,439
The marriage was just a hype.

18
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:50,679
That was out of line.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,679
Uncles,

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,759
it's true that Duoduo and I
haven't gotten married.

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,039
But I really had no intention to hype.

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,000
How do you explain
the shortage of money?

23
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,640
Exactly.

24
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,719
The shortage of money is real.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,120
Boss.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
I'd like to hear 
what Qin Qi has to say.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,719
This morning,

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,640
problems arose
in all three downstream firms,

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,120
which made the group's cash flow suffer,

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,239
and the market value
drop by 1.5 billion.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,840
The situation is really bad.

32
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,760
How can it be so coincidental?

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,680
If anything should happen to Qin Group,

34
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,879
it would be all your fault.

35
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,079
I already said,

36
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,359
a young naive boy like him

37
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,799
can't be the head of the Qin family.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,359
Qin Qi,

39
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,560
if you can't solve the problems 
within three days,

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
you are to resign as the head.

41
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,680
Mrs. Xu is right.

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
That makes sense.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,159
We shouldn't have made
a young boy the president.

44
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400
We should do as Mrs. Xu suggested.

45
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,040
Wait.

46
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,079
How can we find 1.5 billion
in three days?

47
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,359
I'll figure this out.

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,280
It's not an easy task 
to find 1.5 billion in three days.

49
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,879
How bold he is.

50
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,599
Three days.

51
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,560
How are you going to do it?

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
I can help you with that.

53
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,599
Qin Qi,

54
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,120
I'm the only one who can help you now.

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
As long as you marry me,

56
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,120
Wu family will help you pull through.

57
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,599
Don't you think

58
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,960
this is the best solution?

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,159
Miss An.

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,120
You're Miss An, right?

61
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,560
Miss An.

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,759
Wait, what are you doing?

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,479
Miss An.

64
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,520
Miss An.

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,319
I have a question.

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:24,919
Miss An.

67
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,840
Excuse me.

68
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,840
Miss An, why did you lie about
getting married with Qin Qi?

69
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,120
Do you mind giving us an explanation?

70
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,919
Are you aware of

71
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,000
Qin Group's financial difficulty?

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
Is your becoming a best-selling designer

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
a deliberate marketing hype?

74
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
No. What are you talking about?

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,159
Go. I'll take care of this.

76
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll stay with you.

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
(Qin's Jewelry)
Mr. Qin, what is Jenny to you?

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,919
Does Qin Group

79
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,759
really have

80
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,080
 a serious capital chain problem?

81
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,319
No comment.

82
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
What does it have to do with you?

83
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,120
I admit

84
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,280
I lied to you.

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,759
It was all because of my selfishness.

86
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,080
I coerced

87
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,599
and used An Duoduo.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,199
So please don't go after her.

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,360
I'll take the blame.

90
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,719
Today,

91
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,680
I'll resign as
the president of Qin Group.

92
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,479
What?

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,520
No.

94
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,439
Mr. Qin.

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,439
Mr. Qin, why?

96
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,120
Mr. Qin...

97
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop.

98
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,879
Why, Mr. Qin?

99
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,360
Stop filming them.

100
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,159
Stop.

101
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
This place you found is really nice.

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,879
But

103
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,599
why did you bring me here?

104
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't forget 
that we still have our third date.

105
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Isn't that Qin Qi?

106
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,080
Isn't their marriage fake?

107
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,199
It's really Qin Qi.

108
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,960
Come on.

109
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,159
Do you want a bite?

110
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,960
We already know the truth.

111
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Why are they still pretending?

112
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,599
Yeah, yeah. I just enjoy pretending.

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Take a picture. Hurry.

114
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Aren't you afraid of being talked about?

115
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,279
Won't we be exhausted

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,680
if we always care about 
others' opinions?

117
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,279
We might as well just let them talk.

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
How was the date today?

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Well, you've made some progress lately.

120
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,079
But there's still room to improve.

121
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,160
Qin Qi.

122
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,519
How did you get in?

123
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,199
Did you climb the wall?

124
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,800
You didn't break into our house, 
did you?

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,879
Qin Qi, why did you resign?

126
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,199
You are the head of the Qin family.

127
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,680
You can't just give Qin Group up.

128
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,879
You are behind all this, aren't you?

129
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,759
That's what you get when you disobey me

130
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,560
and hurt my feelings.

131
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,040
Have you made up your mind?

132
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,959
Do you choose to marry me
or to lose everything?

133
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,680
Tell me.

134
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,519
You...

135
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,560
Recently,

136
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
I've figured out

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,079
that marriage should not be a game

138
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,279
or a deal.

139
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:56,959
Jenny,

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll only marry the woman I choose.

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,199
What?

142
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,800
Haven't we chosen each other already?

143
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,560
Look.

144
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,360
This is the proof
that we love each other.

145
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,439
Wake up.

146
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,360
You always know

147
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,000
that you are not the person I love.

148
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,279
Your threat won't work on me,

149
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,959
because even if I lose everything,

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,879
I'll still hold on to An Duoduo.

151
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,160
I love her.

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,199
I've always loved her.

153
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,240
Only her.

154
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,399
You're lying.

155
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,759
You're lying...

156
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,639
Call her doctor, now.

157
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,160
Yes.

158
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,839
You're lying.

159
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,800
How could you say that to her?

160
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,519
She is a patient.

161
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,879
You're lying.

162
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,680
What she needs is thorough treatment,

163
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,959
not my tolerance.

164
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,839
Don't worry.

165
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,360
Jenny,

166
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,480
it's okay.

167
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,399
Calm down.

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,439
Your doctor is on the way.

169
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,399
I need to see Weiwei.

170
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,519
You are all lying.

171
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:46,839
Weiwei?

172
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,399
