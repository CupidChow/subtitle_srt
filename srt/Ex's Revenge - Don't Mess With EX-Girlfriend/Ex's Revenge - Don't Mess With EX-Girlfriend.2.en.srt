(Groom Qin Lang, Bride Li Weiwei)

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,519
Yes.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm her husband.

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,479
Since we are all here to get married,

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,159
how about having a group wedding?

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,240
Do you mind?

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,280
Nope, right?

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,439
I do.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,880
I'm getting married,

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:43,960
step aside.

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,159
I...

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,960
Never mind.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,079
Let's go.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,759
Let's start.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
May I have your name?

18
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,439
Qin Qi.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,320
Mr. Qin Qi,

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,280
do you take Miss An Duoduo

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,320
to be your wife

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,079
and love her forever?

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,799
I do.

24
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,600
Miss An Duoduo,

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,400
do you take Mr. Qin Qi

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
to be your husband

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,959
and love him forever?

28
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,879
I do.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,760
Now

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,280
please exchange the rings

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,680
in the name of husband and wife.

32
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,400
Here, the rings.

33
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,120
Now,

34
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,079
let's give applause to bless the couple.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,319
What's going on now？

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Congratulations, Mr. Qin!

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
Who are you?

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,520
Relax.

39
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,159
I'll finish the mission.

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm quite professional.

41
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,039
Okay.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,120
And now,

43
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,840
the groom may kiss

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,319
his beautiful bride.

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,919
(Great!)

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,680
(Go for it!)

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,120
(Go!)

Next,

50
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,479
please exchange the rings.

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,360
I...

52
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,000
(Here.)

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,759
(Cheers.)

54
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,400
Mr. Qin.

55
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,039
Mrs. Qin.

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,000
A toast to you.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,000
Mr. Qin.

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,199
Thank you so much for your help today.

59
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,160
I mistook you for an extra.

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,120
What can I do?

62
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,800
I took your money,

63
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,199
so I'm all yours.

64
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,360
You have a good sense of humor.

65
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,720
One more favor.

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,759
Qin Qi, you haven't seen Qin Lang for ages.

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
He works in the jewelry company
of our group.

68
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,120
He has many ideas

69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,279
and wants to talk to you.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,519
Say something.

71
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,480
Congratulations,

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,439
Uncle.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Also to you,

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,839
Duoduo.

75
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,199
Au-au-

76
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,560
Aunt.

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Congrats to you, too.

78
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,439
Ne-ne-

79
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,759
Nephew.

80
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,120
Your big diamond ring looks really nice.

81
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,480
You won't take it back, will you?

82
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,759
No, we won't.

83
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,399
You can keep it if you like.

84
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,480
Qin Lang...

85
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,480
It's late.

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm in a hurry

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
for my wedding night.

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,000
Mom, look at them...

89
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,040
It's done.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,240
Thanks a lot for today.

91
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,560
Thanks.

92
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,040
What now?

93
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Are you running away
after getting revenge?

94
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,319
Watch out.

95
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,839
(After so many years,)

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,560
(we finally met again.)

97
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,000
Why is this An Duoduo

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,160
not answering my phone call?

99
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,279
I've waited for ages.

100
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,839
Excuse me, Bro.

101
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,680
Do you know the location of
An Duoduo's wedding?

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,639
Thank you, Bro.

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,680
That's enough.

104
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,439
Stop drinking.

105
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,279
Today is my big day...

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,040
Mom.

107
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,959
Look.

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,199
What do you call this?

109
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,759
It seems

110
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,079
that I underestimated An Duoduo.

111
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,000
In only a few days

112
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,120
did she find her way to marry Qin Qi.

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,399
What?

114
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,279
An Duoduo didn't go with Qin Qi?

115
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,800
She still stays in the house she rents.

116
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,480
Could it be

117
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,879
that her wedding with Qin Qi is

118
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,199
a fake one?

119
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,959
It must be fake.

120
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,720
An Duoduo

121
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,759
is so cunning.

122
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,240
She is capable of anything.

123
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,680
Mom, please set things straight for me.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,680
Rest assured.

125
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,800
You are the daughter-in-law
that I recognize.

126
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,759
I won't let anyone bully you.

127
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,879
Mr. Wang.

128
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,680
Mr. Wang.

129
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,600
Why does Li Weiwei get to be a designer

130
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,240
and I have to be her assistant?

131
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,879
Duoduo,

132
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,439
I understand how you feel.

133
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,680
Both of you were designer assistants.

134
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,600
However,

135
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
she got a promotion.

136
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,560
She's the vice president's wife.

137
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,000
But...

138
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,959
The higher-ups made the arrangement.

139
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,879
I can do nothing about it.

140
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,399
Why don't you get yourself
a promotion too?

141
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
But you said it yourself

142
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,439
that the one who won
the internal selection

143
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,959
would be promoted to be a designer.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,560
That's right.

145
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,600
We have a winner.

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,920
It's Li Weiwei.

147
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
(Jewelry Design Competition
First place: Li Weiwei)

148
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,279
This is...

149
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,160
This is my design.

150
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,279
Explain to me.

151
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,439
How did it become yours?

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Now you're my assistant,

153
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,920
so all your drawings are at my service.

154
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
Why can't I use it.

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,079
You are shameless.

156
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,040
How can you do this?

157
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,279
You're that one who played dirty first.

158
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,399
An Duoduo.

159
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,120
Don't think I don't know

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
your marriage with Qin Qi is fake.

161
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,840
What a shame.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
What's fake cannot be true.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,039
From what I can see,

164
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,759
you are nothing but a powerless ant

165
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,000
that only deserves to be crashed by me.

166
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,720
Are you comfortable

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,879
sitting on that chair?

168
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,440
Your power is borrowed.

169
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,919
Won't you feel uneasy

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,879
that you may one day

171
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,679
fall off the chair.

172
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay then.

173
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,360
Let's see

174
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,759
who will fall down first.

175
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,279
Oh,

176
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,559
Assistant An,

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,480
my pen dropped.

178
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,000
Please pick it up for me.

179
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,840
I'll pick it up...

180
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,559
I'll pick it up

181
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,240
in your dream.

182
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,399
You wretch!

183
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,440
Weiwei.

184
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,200
Duoduo.

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,840
I know you don't like me,

186
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,679
but you shouldn't hit me.

187
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,360
An Duoduo, be civilized.

188
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
How could you hit her?

189
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
I didn't hit her.

190
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,080
If you go on like this,

191
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,240
I'll hit her right now.

192
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,399
Apologize to Weiwei now.
