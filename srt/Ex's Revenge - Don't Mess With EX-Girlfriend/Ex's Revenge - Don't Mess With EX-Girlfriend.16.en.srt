Duoduo,

4
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,600
actually, all these years,

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,199
you've been like this moon.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,839
You're always in my heart.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
Duoduo, all these years,

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,000
you've been like this moon.

9
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,159
Actually all these years,

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,479
you've been like this moon.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
Duoduo, all these years...

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,920
Boss!

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,719
Flowers, fireworks,

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,000
drones,

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,479
and a honeymoon suite

16
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,640
are again in place.

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,960
I also

18
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,359
prepared this.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,159
Boss.

20
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,799
The diamond ring
is right under the cake.

21
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,959
Under this heart-shaped decoration.

22

Remember.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,239
Boss, you can do it.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,040
I rushed to confess
my love for her last time.

25
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,400
This time,

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,840
I'll surely give An Duoduo

27
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,159
a perfect experience.

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,359
How is it?

29
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:34,760
Do I look handsome in this suit?

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,760
Yes.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,079
You can do it.

32
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,479
Qin Qi.

33

Boss.

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,759
Jenny, what are you doing here?

35
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,560
Qin Qi, I missed you so much.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,400
Sorry.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,360
I shouldn't have left you for so long.

38

Ex-girlfriend?

44
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,280
To be exact,

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,759
we've never broken up.

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,159
Back then, I went abroad willfully

47
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,599
and broke his heart.

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
