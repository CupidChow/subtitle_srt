Qin Qi.

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
How did you get so drunk suddenly?

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,600
I told you not to drink too much.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,760
We're almost there.

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,759
It was just a kiss.

00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,359
We were

10
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,760
drunk.

11

Drunk.

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,439
Qin, you got one letter.

13
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:53,920
Thank you.

14
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
Dear kind Sir.

15
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,039
Thank you for your sponsorship

16
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,479

and also scored the top in my grade.

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,919
I will study hard,

21

get into a good university,

22

Hopefully, one day,

25
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,639
I could say thank you in person.

An Duoduo and Qin Qi went to
her hometown suddenly.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,199
I found that she still has some proof.

Tomorrow we should meet up
for our countermeasures.

Everyone,

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,279
I'm An Duoduo, designer of the Lonely Tree.

48
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,199
It was said by some press

49
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,160
that I plagiarized the new product of
Rongchang Jewelry.

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,879
I have to say,

51
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,199
that's not true.

52
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,759
I can guarantee  with my life

53
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,600
that I am the original designer of
the Lonely Tree.

54
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,639
Rongchang Jewelry is the one
who plagiarized.

55
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,759
Words alone are no proof.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,079
Rongchang Jewelry just published

57
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,879
their draft design

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,480

00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,800
Miss An, where is your draft design?

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,079
My draft design

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,600
was stolen.

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,560
Stolen?

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,360
How?

64
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah.

65
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:50,720
But,

66
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,519
the inspiration of this product

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,160
came from a tree

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,279
that grew up with me.

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,959
I want every girl
who wears this necklace

70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,879
to remember the beauty of
their childhood,

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,199
and keep the innocence of that.

72
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,439
Here's a picture of that tree.

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,279
This is a draft
I sketched ten years ago.

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,240
This

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,120
is the picture of the tree

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,079
as my inspiration.

77
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,160

It's true. It can't open.

Designer An Duoduo,

93
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,160
a child's painting can prove nothing.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,199
You're so desperate for
a press conference.

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,879
Is it because of your guilty conscience?

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,879
I heard that your design

97
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,399
was suspected of plagiarism
in your own company.

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,399
Are you a plagiarism recidivist?

99
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,879
You come from a small village

100
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,199
and became a designer at a young age.

101
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,360
I wonder if there's an inside story?

102
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,199
I'm not.

103
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,759
Please answer my question directly.

104
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:03,639
I...

105
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,279
Everyone.

106
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,120
Qin's Jewelry

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
is the pillar company of Qin Group.

108
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,959
The Qin family have run the company
for a hundred years.

109
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,560
We will never risk its reputation.

110
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,199
Although An Duoduo is young,

111
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,920
she is very talented.

112
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,439
The very first bracelet she designed

113
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,959
received very good feedback
from the market.

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
So,

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,040
I believe in her.

116
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Mr. Qin.

117
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,240
You are the president of Qin Group.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,720
Why are you so protective

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,600
toward a little designer
from the branch?

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,279
Someone took a picture of you and Miss An

121

spending the night together at a villa.

122

No way.

123
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,240
It's true.

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,040
Shoot it.

125
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,199
Do you two have

126
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,319
a secret relationship?

127
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,399
Breaking news.

128
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,240
That's really breaking news.

129
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,360
Miss An.

130
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,279
Aren't you ashamed of

131
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,199
taking advantage of your beauty?

132
00:06:59,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Take this on camera.

133
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,079
Quickly.

134
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,399
Breaking news.

135
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,120
Don't block my camera.

136
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,920
A secret relationship?

137
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,720
Reporter,

138
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,040
please show some respect.

139
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
An Duoduo

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,199
is my wife.

141
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,720
This is...

142
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,319
impossible.

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,199
When did they announce it?

144
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:25,959
Breaking news.

145
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,920
Are you insane?

146
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,639
Reporter.

147
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,920
You didn't bother to find out the truth

148
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
but slander me and my wife

149
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,120
according to some pictures.

150
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,639
What's your intention?

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,360
I... I...

152
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,560
I, I, I.

153
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,399
What do you want to say?

154
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,759
I was going to save you some dignity.

155
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,160
Aren't you the nephew of Mr. Lin
of Rongchang Jewelry?

156
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,879
Rongchang Jewelry?

157
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,279
He is Mr. Lin's nephew?

158
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,120
He is with Rongchang?

159
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,959
Since Miss An is your wife,

160
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,839
you should not cover up for her.

161
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,279
Or maybe

162
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,959
you are conniving her?

163
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
This is a newspaper from ten years ago.

164
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,480
It published

165
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,800
the news of Little Red Flower
children's creative competition,

166
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,240
saying clearly

167
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
the winner was An Duoduo.

168
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,120
That's impossible.

169
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,560
Even if you can hack the website,

170
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,240
can you also destroy

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,480
all the published newspapers?

172
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,560
Go back and tell your uncle

173
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,759
to focus on his products.

174
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,879
Don't play those dirty tricks.

175
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,919
The Qin Group

176
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,279
will not let go of this.

177
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,480
Don't shoot.

178
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,480
Stop shooting. Stop.

179
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,759
Right.

180
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,120
Mr. Qin.

181
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,799
When did you marry Miss An?

182
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,120
Mr. Qin.

183
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,879
Could you share some stories of

184
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,000
you and Miss An?

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,879
Sorry.

186
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,679
I can't tell you

187
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,120
without my wife's permission.

188
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,759
Everyone.

189
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,600
I didn't announce my marriage

190
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,639
because Duoduo is not only my wife

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,559
but also an individual.

192
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,600
She is a very talented designer.

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
I don't want to hold her back.

194
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,440
So I'm here to ask you

195
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
not to regard her as

196
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,360
Qin Qi's wife.

197
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
I hope one day,

198
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
you'd call me

199
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,519
An Duoduo's husband.

200
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,080
Great speech.

201
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,720
Miss An.

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,480
Miss An, please wait. Miss An.

203
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
Miss An, Miss An.

204
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,000
Miss An.

205
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,360
Miss An, please stay.
