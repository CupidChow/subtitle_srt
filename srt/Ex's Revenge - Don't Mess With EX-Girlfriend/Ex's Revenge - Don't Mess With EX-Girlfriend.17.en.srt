=Episode 17=

3
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,320
Boss.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,399
Your plan

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,560
really worked!

6
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,600
Duoduo is headstrong,

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,560
you can't be forceful with her.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,920
If I hadn't faked these wounds,

9
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,799
I'm afraid

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
I would never have seen her again.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,920
But Madam came back.

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,679
This means she still has 
feelings for you.

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,640
Oh right,

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,840
how are things with Jenny?

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,719
I told her you went on a business trip.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,240
The lie worked.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I don't think she will

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,479
come look for you these next few days.

19
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,560
I thought Jenny had been in therapy 
abroad all this time.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,480
I've sealed off

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,280
all news about me.

22
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,000
How did she find out 
about me and Duoduo?

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Boss.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,239
You have done all you can for her.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,760
Stop worrying about her.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,280
We are in debt to her parents.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,120
We can't let anything happen
 to their only daughter.

28
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,200
You're right.

29
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,920
It's about time.

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,959
Madam will be here soon 
to stay the night.

31
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,200
Do your best. Don't slip up.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,439
You should let your Jenny
take care of you during the night.

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,760
There's really nothing going on
between Jenny and me.

34
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,719
It's true we've known each other 
since we were kids,

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,680
but I've never felt

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,919
attracted to her.

37
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,639
Not to mention being together with her.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
But why didn't you deny it yesterday?

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
You even let her hug you.

40
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,199
Jenny has a history of 
mental health issues.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
She suffered from delusions

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
and is also prone to bipolar disorder.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
She's been getting treatment abroad.

44
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,120
I didn't deny it yesterday,

45
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,039
because I didn't want to trigger her.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,479
I hugged her to stop her 
from hurting you.

47
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,719
I still can't trust you that easily.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,240
We should stay apart

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
and cool down for a while.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
Duoduo, don't go.

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,639
You...

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,520
Your hands are fine.

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,599
It's a medical miracle.

54
00:02:59,319 --> 00:02:59,879
It's the power of love.

55
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,080
The power of love.

56
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,479
Just forget it.

57
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,240
Duoduo!

58
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,520
Duoduo!

59
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,639
Duoduo!

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
Strange, the power went out.

61
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,800
Mr. Qin, please wait a moment.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
Let me check the backup power supply.

63
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,560
Wait!

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,240
Careful!

65
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,199
Are you alright?

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,319
Careful.

67
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,040
Are you alright?

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,600
It's so dark.

69
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,160
Look, there's a moon behind my ear.

70
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,560
So no matter how dark it is,
I will always shine bright.

71
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
Don't be afraid. 
I will always be with you.

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,839
It's you?

73
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,240
Weiwei. Weiwei?

74
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
What should I do?

75
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,279
Qin Qi is still giving me 
the cold shoulder.

76
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,560
What?

77
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,319
Didn't Qin Qi go abroad?

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,439
How did he get hurt?

79
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,920
Miss Jenny,

80
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,959
this was all a ploy 
set up by An Duoduo.

81
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,319
She's a scheming and plotting woman.

82
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,480
She wants to have Qin Qi for herself

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
and replace you.

84
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,279
You can't let her get away with it.

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,199
So what should I do?

86
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,439
How can I get Qin Qi

87
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,360
to be with me?

88
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,120
I have an idea.
