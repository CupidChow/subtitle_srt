=Episode 13=

3
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,800
Qin Lang. Don't be so heartless, okay?

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,070
Li Weiwei. Get out of this place.

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,790
I beg you.

6
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,320
Don't divorce me.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,670
You're too selfish

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,320
to have a bottom line.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,280
You stoop to lowdown tricks

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,470
and even framed Duoduo.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,470
Getting you a chance to get bailed

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,000
was to save
the reputation of the Qin family.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,000
Qin Lang. I love you.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Everything I've done is for you.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,670
If you still have a conscience,

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,670
sign the divorce agreement
you're holding.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,790
From now on,

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,320
be a good person.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,470
Mom.

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,710
Li Weiwei. What are you doing?

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,000
Mom.

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,040
Mom.

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,280
It was An Duoduo who framed me.

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,640
Believe me.

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,430
You nearly killed my son.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,950
Letting him marry
a vicious woman like you,

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,760
I was so blind back then.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,070
I'm warning you.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,150
Sign this divorce agreement immediately.

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,480
Otherwise,

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,840
your dad can kiss

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,150
his small business goodbye.

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,510
Mom!

34
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,120
If I can let Qin Lang replace Qin Qi

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,280
as the head of the Qin family,

36
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,640
can you not kick me out?

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,790
What did you say?

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,710
Is everything
at the French restaurant ready?

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,400
Yes.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,870
Wait.

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,120
I think there's still something missing.

42
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,280
What?

43
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,950
A surprise.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
A surprise?

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
Will Madam be going?

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,230
Duoduo said

47
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,560
three times.

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,080
Three times?

49
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,800
What three times?

50
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,870
Could it be...?

51
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,240
Mr. Qin is too good.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,590
Sir.

53
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,080
What would you like to have?

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,950
(Menu in French)

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Whatever is fine.

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll order for you.

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,630
Two steaks.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,360
Okay.

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,190
Before the main course arrives,

60
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,470
I've also prepared

61
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,750
some delicious dessert for you.

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,680
Dessert is good. I like dessert.

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,630
Will the dessert be served
after the violin-playing?

64
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,470
Isn't this sweet enough?

65
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,360
Next.

66
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,710
Next.

67
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,310
I don't want to eat here anymore.

68
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,470
Let's go.

69
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,360
Today's date is a failure, isn't it?

70
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,590
Duoduo.

71
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,120
I know

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,030
I can't force anything,

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,150
but I'll try my best

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,040
to make you like me.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,360
Wait till I tell that person everything.

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,240
An Duoduo. Let's see
how much more good time you can enjoy.

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,920
What? I was expelled
from the competition?

78
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,270
The Jewellery Design Competition

79
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,190
is the most important competition
in the industry.

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,630
But due to
the previous plagiarism incident,

81
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,680
there has been some controversy online.

82
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,480
But everything has been explained clearly

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,950
at the press conference.

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,830
I'm the victim.

85
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,950
Our company has already sued Rongchang,

86
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,000
but this won't be over until we win

87
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,360
the plagiarism lawsuit.

88
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,680
So Madam...

89
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,390
No.

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,310
Duoduo.

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,630
I'm afraid you'll have to
bear with it this time.

92
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,480
Duoduo. Are you still working?

93
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,600
Qin Lang.
You've been discharged from the hospital?

94
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,070
Duoduo.

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,510
This...

96
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,630
is the design notebook
that Li Weiwei stole from you.

97
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
She took it to make a deal
with Rongchang.

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
I got it back for you.

99
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,510
I hope it'll help you in your lawsuit.

100
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,600
Do I need to say thank you?

101
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,279
No.

102
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,630
Duoduo.

103
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,560
I owe you this.

104
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,920
I'll never be able to repay

105
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,750
what I owe you.

106
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,830
Your mom is here.

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Qin Lang.

108
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,560
You better go

109
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,560
so your mom won't come here
to give me a hard time.

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,240
Duoduo.

111
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,800
Actually,

112
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,480
I have something else to tell you.

113
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,390
It's about Uncle.

114
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,390
What is it?

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,390
Everyone has a past.

116
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,070
So does he, of course.

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,600
If one day,

118
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,510
he makes you unhappy.

119
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,270
Don't be sad.

120
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,750
You have to remember

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,160
that you still have me!

122
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,879
Go away.

123
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,040
Get out.

124
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,800
Okay.

125
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,439
I'm leaving.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Be happy, Duoduo!

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,560
Get out.

128
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,120
Okay!

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,079
