(Qin's Jewelry)

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,239
Darling,

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm so afraid of Duoduo.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,679
She doesn't cooperate with me at work.

7
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,960
She even wants to take revenge on me.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,399
Don't worry.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,679
Today

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
I will get even for you.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,679
(An Duoduo.)

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,399
(With Qin Lang at my back,)

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,840
(you'll be fired sooner or later.)

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,479
Wow.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,039
Wow.

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,479
Amazing!

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,399
The office is shiny!

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,280
Look!

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,399
Good morning, you two.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,520
Duoduo,

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,359
you did the cleaning by yourself?

22
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,319
Sure.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Designer Li,

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,719
look.

25
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,079
Here

26
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,200
are the best-selling jewelry
in the past decade.

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,439
And look here.

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,519
Mocha, Latte, Americano,

29
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,200
black tea, green tea and bubble tea.
Whatever you like.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,840
Satisfied?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Weiwei.

32
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,159
Duoduo has come to her senses,

33
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,400
and she also showed her sincerity.

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,719
You should forgive her.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,599
She must be pretending.

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,760
How could I?

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,239
I've always separated

38
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,959
business from private affairs.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,079
You know that.

40
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,319
I won't take revenge on you
just because of such trivia.

41
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,079
All right.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,319
So you two

43
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,959
forgive and forget.

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,959
That's good！

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,519
I've got to go.

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
Take your time and have a talk.

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,359
Bye bye.

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,879
Qin Lang.

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,920
You.

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,480
Give back my design.

51
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,159
Got it?

52
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,519
How do you prove it's yours?

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,480
Any evidence?

54
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
You hit me.

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,879
What are you talking about?

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,199
Any evidence?

57
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll tell Qin Lang.

58
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,560
No matter I hit you

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,680
or not,

60
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,879
you will say I hit you.

61
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
So I might as well beat you as I wish.

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,120
Son,

63
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,199
today your uncle will come visit.

64
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,439
You must impress him.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Your promotion to be the president

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,840
depends on him.

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,840
I know, mom.

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,400
And be sure

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,039
that An Duoduo is not there.

70
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,639
In case she spoils your plan.

71
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,039
Okay, mom.

72
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Weiwei and Duoduo have made peace.

73
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,879
They will not...

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,759
Qin Lang.

75
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,240
Hello?

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,319
What's that?

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,479
Hello?

78
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,800
Qin Lang.

79
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,080
What happened?

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,240
She hit me.

81
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,199
No, she hit me.

82
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,199
No. I didn't.

83
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,120
Look at my face.

84
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,520
It's red.

85
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,319
It hurts bitterly.

86
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,120
Weiwei.

87
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,240
I did get up very early

88
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
in order to clean your office.

89
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,960
How can you treat me like this?

90
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,759
It's so bad!

91
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,560
No. I didn't.

92
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,479
How could you hit her so hard?

93
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,439
You don't believe me?

94
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
Who dared to hit my wife?

95
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,479
You're fired.

96
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,120
I...

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,240
What happened?

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
You seemed to get along earlier.

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,520
Well,

100
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
here's the thing.

101
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,719
I didn't ask for your help.

102
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,879
My acting was not finished yet.

103
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,879
Nosy.

104
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,360
Be my wife,

105
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
and everything will be fine.

106
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
A man's mouth

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,759
is full of lies.

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,759
This matter

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,599
has to be handled by myself.

110
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,319
Thanks.

111
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,560
Don't you want to get your design back?

112
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,479
Your mouth

113
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,800
cannot prove anything.

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,319
My family urges me to marry.

115
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,280
Just be my wife for 3 months,

116
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,639
and I'll help you.

117
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,639
Are you saying

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll pretend to be your wife?

119
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,240
It can work.

120
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
But

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,839
if I say yes,

122
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,639
how are you going to help me?

123
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,439
During my visit today,

124
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,480
I happened to

125
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,639
hear about a dispute.

126
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,120
Since all higher-ups are present,

127
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,879
we can discuss and hear your comments.

128
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,519
Li Weiwei.

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
Is this your design?

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,279
Yes, it is.

131
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,839
You're lying.

132
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,000
Words alone are no proof.

133
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,199
You have 15 minutes

134
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,000
to draw the design individually.

135
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,199
The one whose drawing
matches the original

136
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,480
will be the true designer.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,680
It starts now.

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,439
It's unfair.

139
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,639
She read my draft.

140
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,800
Certainly she knows how to draw.

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,600
I won't draw.

142
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,639
You won't draw

143
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,519
or you dare not draw?

144
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,199
Qin Lang.

145
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,439
Say something.

146
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,480
I think...

147
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,519
I think she should draw.

148
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,040
What did you say?

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,839
Sure.

150
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,680
I agree.

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,480
Totally.

152
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
Weiwei, real gold does not
fear the test of fire.

153
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:20,959
Just draw.

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,519
I have drawn it.

155
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,279
This is my draft.

156
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you sure?

157
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,439
I'm the designer.

158
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,560
Of course, I know the details.

159
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,439
That's a pity.

160
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,759
This one

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,959
is my new drawing.

162
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,279
Come forward

163
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,240
so that everyone can see clearly.

164
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,519
Please look here.

165
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,240
The name of my work

166
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,439
is "Meeting on a Rainy Day".

167
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,199
So

168
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,800
I replaced the circular jewelry inside

169
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,399
with a raindrop-shaped one.

170
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,279
So

171
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,040
how could there be
a circular design here?

172
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,639
That's correct.

173
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,040
I didn't see it clearly.

174
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
My design should be this one.

175
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,680
Oh, is it?

176
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,879
Sorry for you again.

177
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,920
There's no lettering on the bracelet.

178
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,399
So it's not the original one.

179
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,160
Li Weiwei.

180
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,879
Look at these three designs.

181
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,639
Li Weiwei.

182
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,839
You actually stole her design!

183
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,199
How could you do that?

184
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,120
Things are clear now.

185
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,879
Li Weiwei.

186
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,360
You're fired.

187
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,839
Boss.

188
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,279
She was fired half an hour ago.

189
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,600
Make a Group announcement

190
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:29,800
that she'll

191
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,199
never be recruited.

192
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,759
The meeting is over.

193
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,600
You disappointed me.

194
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,040
Qin Lang, I can explain.

195
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,199
Today,

196
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,439
thank you for your help.

197
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,560
Congrats on your promotion,

198
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,000
Designer An Duoduo.

199
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:53,959
Congrats.

200
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,040
Don't forget our agreement,

201
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,199
Honey.

202
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
Now that I am Mrs. Qin,

203
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,199
shouldn't I get financial support?

204
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm right about to rent a house,

205
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,199
Honey.

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,680
Move in to my house

207
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,839
and no rent is required.

208
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,439
You wish!

209
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,839
Attend my family dinner tomorrow

210
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,720
and I will pay you

211
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,160
10,000 yuan.

212
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:19,879
Deal.

213
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,680
It's ridiculous.

214
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,759
Qin Qi fired you in public.

215
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,439
It was a humiliation to my son.

216
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,240
Mom.

217
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,279
It's An Duoduo's fault.

218
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,480
This woman is a cheater

219
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,120
full of lies.

220
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,240
Uncle must have been used by her.

221
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,480
As she's taken revenge on me,

222
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,480
perhaps

223
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
Qin Lang will be the next.

224
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,399
Mom.

225
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,759
How dare she!

226
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,920
Mom.

227
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,839
An Duoduo is extremely vindictive.

228
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,759
Please do something.

229
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,639
The family dinner of the Qins is
tomorrow.

230
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,120
I will turn to Old madam Qin

231
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,399
to fix her.

232
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,199
What a splendid yard!

233
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,319
Sure it is.

234
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,600
This is my uncle's.

235
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,560
He is rich.

236
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,279
Will you become the master

237
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,600
of the Qin family in the future?

238
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Don't talk rot.

239
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,279
Wait.

240
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,759
What's this?

241
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,879
Be careful.

242
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Mom said that old madam Qin
loves antiques best.

243
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,959
She specially asked me to bring a gift.

244
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,920
It's valuable.

245
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,399
Let me have a look.

246
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,560
Be careful.

247
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,799
We'll have dinner here?

248
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,080
You will meet my mom today.

249
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,200
Behave well.

250
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,320
Don't give yourself away.

251
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,440
But there are so many people,

252
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,519
what if I...

253
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,559
What if I make a small mistake?

254
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll deduct your money.

255
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,879
I will be a wonderful daughter-in-law.

256
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,879
Watch yourself.

257
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,240
Duoduo.

258
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,360
You need a talk with your uncle, right?

259
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,799
Yes.

260
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,080
I'll look around by myself.

261
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,759
Uncle,

262
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
I want to report to you

263
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,639
about our company's financing.

264
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,159
Can't we talk later?

265
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,399
The dinner is not ready yet,

266
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,679
so we have time to talk a little.

267
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,639
Okay. Make it quick.

268
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,240
Oops.

269
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,799
The security of the Qin family is so weak.

270
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,679
they'll let any cats and dogs get in.

271
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,679
Indeed.

272
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,720
Their barking makes my ears ache.
