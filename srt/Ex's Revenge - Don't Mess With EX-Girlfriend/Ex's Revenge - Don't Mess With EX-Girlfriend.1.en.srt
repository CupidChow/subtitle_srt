=Don't Mess With EX-Girlfriend=

00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,470
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,239
You look amazing!

4
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,399
If the groom were here today,

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,719
he would be crazy for you.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,799
He is an ambitious man

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,200
and always busy with work.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,840
So it's okay.

9
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,170
(Qin Lang: Aiweier Hotel)

10
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:29,920
What time is it?

11
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,879
I have to go see Duoduo
try on her wedding dress.

12
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,560
You are getting married next week.

13
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,680
I want to keep
my last special memory with you.

14
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:40,879
Weiwei.

15
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,640
Don't feel stressed.

16
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,920
I'm willing to do this for you.

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,200
Weiwei.

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,560
If only Duoduo could be half

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,920
as gentle and sensible as you.

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,920
Qin Lang.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,519
I love you.

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,959
Who is it?

23
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,079
Good day. Food delivery.

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,239
Come in.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,919
Duoduo.

26
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,080
Why are you here?

27
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,919
It's not her fault.

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,719
Qin Lang.

29
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,599
You hit me.

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,759
So I did.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,719
You jerk.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,719
And you.

33
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,719
Don't hurt him.

34
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,960
Hit me if you want.

35
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,599
That's all because I love him too much.

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,800
Drop the act.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,199
I treated you as a friend.

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,759
How stupid was I!

40
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,840
Stop. Enough.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,719
Look at you.

42
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,639
You are like a shrew.

43
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,439
Are you done?

44
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,439
Me?

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,199
Are you okay?

46
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,240
I must have been blind

47
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,879
to love a guy like you,

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,639
a jerk who is even blinder!

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,639
An Duoduo.

50
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,840
What are you doing?

51
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,840
Sir, you...

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,400
(What's wrong with them?)

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,280
(So weird.)

54
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,120
(What happened?)

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,599
What?

56
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,639
He didn't cancel the wedding avenue

57
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,639
but changed the bride.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,360
Is he still a man?

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,280
I will not just let it go.

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,560
How dare he cheat on my best friend?

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,199
Let's go.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,159
To the Qins.

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,680
We'll turn their house upside down.

64
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,400
Wait.

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,759
That's too easy for them.

66
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,680
What's your plan then?

67
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,280
I'll back you whatever.

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,080
Congratulations.

69
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,039
That way, please.

70
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,400
(Qin Lang, Li Weiwei)

71
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,959
The bride seems different from the one

72
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,839
on the invitation card.

73
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,240
Mom.

74
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,639
We should just cancel the wedding.

75
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,680
It's awkward
to change the bride like this!

76
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,519
It...

77
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,920
Congratulations.

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,879
Come here.

79
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,519
That way, please.

80
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,199
It's not awkward at all.

81
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,639
Weiwei's family and education background

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,319
are a hundred times better than An Duoduo,

83
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,879
a country bumpkin.

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,439
The most important is

85
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,439
that your youngest uncle is
coming today.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,560
What?

87
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,360
He is also coming?

88
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,120
Yes.

89
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,560
He is now the master of the Qin family.

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,240
Even I have to show respect to him.

91
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,639
It's hard to see him in person.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,079
My son.

93
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,439
If you don't want to be

94
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,879
a vice president for a lifetime,

95
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,240
take this chance

96
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,600
and please him at your best.

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you hear me?

98
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,439
Got it, mom.

99
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,439
Why is he not here yet?

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,680
We've waited so long.

101
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,399
Why is he so late?

102
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,959
There he is.

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,560
Mr. Qin.

104
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,160
Sorry, everyone.

105
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Mr. Qin is not working today.

106
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,759
Mr. Qin is not working today.

107
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,480
Sorry.

108
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,040
Please leave now.

109
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,079
Hello.

110
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,600
(Mr. Qin.)

111
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,519
Dear friends.

112
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
Please put your hands together

113
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,439
to welcome the gorgeous bride

114
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,360
who will walk down the aisle

115
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,199
in the company of her father.

116
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,450
(Groom Qin Lang, Bride Li Weiwei)

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,959
(Such a perfect match.)

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,120
(The bride is stunning.)

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,079
Weiwei has studied abroad after all.

120
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,120
Her temperament

121
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,399
is much better

122
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,800
than that of An Duoduo.

123
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,319
So it is.

124
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,040
Mr. Qin Lang and Miss Li Weiwei.

125
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,519
Today you're about to...

126
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,040
Hold on.

127
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,199
(Who is it?)

128
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,839
(Who is she?)

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,560
(Who is this?)

130
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,839
(What's going on?)

131
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,759
Duoduo.

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,959
Why are you here?

133
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,480
(This is ridiculous.)

134
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,079
Me? I'm here to get married.

135
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,839
Security guard, kick her out of here.

136
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
I booked the avenue.

137
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,639
Why should I leave?

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,519
Because I am the bride of Qin Lang's.

139
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,319
Not you.

140
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,879
Don't you worry.

141
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,800
No one wants to replace you.

142
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,639
(It's the bride and the groom.)

143
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,040
(The bride is a mistress.)

144
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,600
Qin Lang.

145
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,879
That's him.

146
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
That filthy man
who failed to be faithful

147
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,959
has already been dumped by me.

148
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,600
I, An Duoduo,

149
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,959
from today on,

150
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,000
have nothing to do with him.

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,959
Duoduo, stop messing around.

152
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,879
What?

153
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,240
You can

154
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,959
change

155
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,240
your bride,

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,120
so I can also change my groom.

157
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,199
Get her out.

158
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,160
Now.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,759
(Isn't that Mr. Qin?)

160
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,759
(Why is he here?)

161
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
(I thought he'd gone abroad.)

162
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,199
(It's really Qin Qi.)

163
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,959
(He is more handsome than on TV.)

164
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,840
Why are you so late,

165
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:34,919
Hubby?

166
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,159
(Is Mr. Qin marrying her?)

167
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:36,759
Un-

168
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,519
Un-

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,600
Uncle.

170
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,639
Uncle?

171
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
(It's big news.)

172
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,840
Let me introduce to you all.

173
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,200
This is

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,320
my husband.

175
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,120
Husband.

176
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,559
(I don't understand.)

177
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,039
(Which two are a couple.)

178
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,600
Be professional.

179
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,879
Yes.

180
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,799
I am her husband.

181
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm here already.

182
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,639
What should I be afraid of?

183
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm all geared up.

184
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,480
But where is that extra you found?

185
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,279
You said he was professional, but he...

186
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,679
You do have a good look.

187
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,360
No wonder Chengzi recommended you.

188
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,399
Professional.

189
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,000
What's up?

190
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,200
Your mission today

191
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,679
is to pretend to be my husband.

192
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,879
This is

193
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,120
too little.

194
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,120
Cut the crap.

195
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,919
you took my money and you are mine now.

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
You do whatever I tell you to.

197
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,240
Understood,

198
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,519
Boss.

199
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,200
Okay,

200
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,080
Honey.
