Mom.

4
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,920
This isn't the first time
that we've had a family meeting.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,240
Today is the third day.

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,240
We'll choose a new head of the family.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,520
What if you become a candidate?

8
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,640
How is that possible?

9
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,280
Son, as long as I'm here,

10
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,520
everything is possible.

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,560
Mom,

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
aren't we having a family meeting?

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,079
Where is everybody?

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,399
Li Weiwei, why are you here?

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,560
Quit pretending. I told them everything.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,079
They know everything now.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,480
Boss,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,079
this is the evidence
that Li Weiwei and Liu Yuqin colluded

19
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,319
with others to set up Qin Group.

20
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,120
Liu Yuqin,

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,480
do you think
that if you cooperate with Jenny Wu,

22
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,239
Wu family would help Qin Lang
become the head of the Qin family?

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,519
Mom, is that true?

24
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,879
No way, Qin Qi.

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,200
That's a dirty lie.

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,319
Stop pretending.

27
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,560
Li Weiwei, you betrayed me.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,439
Blame Jenny Wu
if you have to blame someone.

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,760
If that crazy woman hadn't exposed me,

30
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,120
how would I have failed?

31
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,439
Uncle,

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,239
my mom was not thinking straight.

33
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,439
Li Weiwei used her.

34
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,280
Please forgive her.

35
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,359
Qin Lang, I loved you so much.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,359
Yet in the end, you are all good people.

37
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm the only bad one.

38
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,079
I did everything for you.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
And you let me down.

40
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,599
You let yourself down.

41
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,680
Shut up, An Duoduo.

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,319
I hate you the most.

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,959
In terms of family background,
education and appearance,

44
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,080
you are no better than I.

45
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,680
Why would both Qin Lang
and Qin Qi love you?

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,199
Why can you have nice clothes and food,

47
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,280
and be the president's wife,

48
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,840
while I lose everything?

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
Liu Yuqin, Li Weiwei,

50
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,199
you can talk to the lawyer

51
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,560
about what's between you two.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,039
Mr. Zhang,

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,000
call the police.

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,800
Okay.

56
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,520
Stay away.

57
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,280
What are you doing?

58
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,199
Let go.

59
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,719
Uncle, please let my mom go.

60
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,639
You can arrest her.

61

Uncle, please let my mom go.

63

Qin Lang,

64
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,520
it's time

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,680
for you to become independent.

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,560
Mom.

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,719
If you hadn't found Li Weiwei

68
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,919
and tricked Liu Yuqin,

69
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,360
the matter wouldn't have been resolved 
so quickly.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,919
You should take all the credits.

71
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,240
In that case,

72
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,520
should I be

73
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,240
the head of the Qin family?

74
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,319
Isn't the head of the Qin family

75
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,199
also

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
at your service?

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,520
Okay, everyone,

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,560
let's give another round of applause

79

Miss An Duoduo,

94
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,439
would you mind sharing with us

95

(Judge: Lin Tiande)

98
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,399
Once there was a little boy

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,000
who was afraid of the dark, loneliness

100
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,120
and needles.

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,879
But he always pretended

102
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,279
that he wasn't afraid of anything.

103
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,160
Later,

104
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,319
he fell in love with

105
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,839
a girl who was like the moon.

106
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,879
But he kept that a secret

107
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,360
in his hand.

108
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,680
Finally, one day,

109
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,759
a miracle happened.

110
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
They met each other again.

111
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,040
I would like to tell that boy,

112
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,560
the moon will always be by your side

113
