1
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:17,315
You must've been scared.

2
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,425
I could never fathom how scared...

3
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,855
you must've been all this time.

4
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:28,625
But today, I could finally understand.

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,735
And I also realized...

6
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:40,305
that I had a rage inside of me that I never knew existed.

7
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:46,815
I thought I was like a plant, calm and composed.

8
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:50,215
But as if I was throwing a vase,

9
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:55,255
I had a rage within me that made me want to destroy him.

10
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:58,525
Don't be like that.

11
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,225
Don't taint your heart...

12
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,995
with such evil emotions.

13
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:09,235
You can't do that for me.

14
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,505
I was never afraid to lose my life.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,715
I just couldn't die because of my mom.

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,715
But now,

17
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,385
there was another reason why I couldn't die.

18
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:27,585
Him.

19
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:38,795
(Episode 21: May I Confess My Love for You?)

20
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,735
- Sir... - Don't touch me!

21
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:52,775
(Vice-Director Joo Hae Ra)

22
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,925
This won't do.

23
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,165
You should come to my place.

24
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,065
It's okay, I'll just stay here.

25
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,435
Don't worry about me and go.

26
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,445
How did you come here?

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,855
You know very well...

28
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,585
why I'm like this, right?

29
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,005
When I was young,

30
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,315
my parents looked so happy,

31
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,715
so I thought marriage was like playing house.

32
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,455
Like in fairy tales,

33
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,370
I thought you just had...

34
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:44,725
to make soup and take a walk through the forest.

35
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,565
I thought marriage was all about...

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,895
those lovey-dovey and heartwarming stories.

37
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,475
Everyone has fantasies about marriage.

38
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:59,835
Going grocery shopping together...

39
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,305
and picking baby socks.

40
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,675
And at times, arguing over the most trivial matters.

41
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,430
And when the wife...

42
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,185
runs away from home after a fight,

43
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:16,285
her husband would go out barefoot to find her.

44
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,740
Barefoot is a bit too risky.

45
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,540
He's so heartbroken that he hurt his wife.

46
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,665
That's why he forgets that he's barefoot.

47
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:30,705
How was...

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,035
your marriage life?

49
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,375
I bet you were so happy.

50
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,645
Did you get into a fight?

51
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,385
"A fight"?

52
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:19,655
"With whom? Where? Why?"

53
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,585
You stabbed me in the back.

54
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,095
I doubt you didn't know all that when you called.

55
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,025
And many times, at that.

56
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:29,510
I stabbed you?

57
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:31,165
You deceived me,

58
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,135
and yet, you wanted to side with me.

59
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,465
Isn't that betrayal?

60
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:38,905
When I asked...

61
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,175
about Woo Ha Kyung's workroom,

62
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,415
you didn't reply.

63
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,315
But that workroom was actually...

64
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,015
a rooftop house.

65
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,485
The director of a gallery...

66
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,185
works at a rooftop?

67
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,455
Do you take me as a fool?

68
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,425
If you're really on my side,

69
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,295
explain it right now.

70
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,105
What's the truth?

71
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,690
Ms. Joo, you know...

72
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,175
where...

73
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,145
my wife is.

74
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:26,655
You shouldn't look for a woman...

75
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,925
who has left you.

76
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:32,555
That'll only make her hide even better.

77
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,795
And even if she returns,

78
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,765
she may not be yours anymore.

79
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,055
I'm afraid...

80
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,025
that my being with him...

81
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,465
will put him in danger.

82
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,605
I'm afraid...

83
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:51,605
this innocent man will suffer my misfortunes.

84
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,965
Forget about your wife,

85
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,565
and look for a woman who will sincerely love you.

86
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:23,975
Never.

87
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,935
No one can replace her.

88
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,815
"No one can replace her"?

89
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,685
Why are you so pitiful?

90
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,995
I lost...

91
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,065
my parents at a young age...

92
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,165
and grew up unknowing of their love.

93
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,705
And...

94
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,035
I loved a man who didn't even look my way...

95
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,915
for a very long time.

96
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,315
You remind me...

97
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,055
of myself.

98
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,655
What do you know about me?

99
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,935
A heartbroken person...

100
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,135
can recognize another.

101
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:40,615
I sympathize with you.

102
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,535
Kang In Wook...

103
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,465
is capable...

104
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,835
of weaving a terrifying web as soon as tomorrow.

105
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,705
I need to leave...

106
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,945
before I get caught.

107
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,895
I wanted...

108
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,965
to look at your eyes up-close.

109
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,645
Those cold, snake-like eyes of yours.

110
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,815
Ma Ri.

111
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,885
Ma Ri.

112
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,495
Where are you right now?

113
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,365
Where are you?

114
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,165
And who are you?

115
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,805
Who are you?

116
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:35,185
Yoon Ma Ri may not have been able...

117
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,855
to tame that lonely beast.

118
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:41,865
But I can.

119
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,485
Ma Ri?

120
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,425
Ma Ri?

121
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:35,615
Stay away from me.

122
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,755
Only then, will you be safe.

123
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,615
I'm sorry.

124
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,835
The number you have called...

125
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,605
If I can disappear like this...

126
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,100
Where are you?

127
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,525
(Where are you?)

128
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,310
I'm looking everywhere for you.

129
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,205
I'm worried sick. Please pick up the phone.

130
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:22,285
Ma Ri, where are you?

131
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,155
Why are you looking for me?

132
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,195
Don't do that.

133
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,765
I want you to stop suffering...

134
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:32,965
because of me.

135
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,710
My being next to you...

136
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,505
will only make you miserable.

137
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:40,180
Ma Ri, what do you...

138
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,975
I don't want to feel sorry anymore.

139
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,345
I promise that one day,

140
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:48,030
I'll pay you back for the debt that I owe you.

141
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,800
This is a pre-boarding announcement.

142
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,730
Munsan. The train heading for Munsan...

143
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,625
- will be arriving soon. - All right.

144
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:58,770
- Please come to gate eight. - Goodbye.

145
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,595
And I'm sorry.

146
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:09,265
Munsan. The train heading for Munsan will be arriving soon.

147
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:52,245
(Seoul to Munsan)

148
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,145
You said you didn't want to see me going through a hard time.

149
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,215
Then...

150
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,755
don't go.

151
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:48,340
If I stay, I'll only endanger you.

152
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,495
That's okay.

153
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,365
So, don't leave.

154
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,325
Her hands...

155
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,525
desperately held me...

156
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,465
as if she was waiting for me.

157
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,295
As if she was telling me to save her.

158
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,935
As if...

159
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,905
she was waiting for me to hold her back.

160
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,545
I could sense her feelings...

161
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,445
when she held me.

162
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,365
Why did I...

163
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,875
Why did I...

164
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,575
see Ma Ri's face...

165
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,875
from Woo Ha Kyung?

166
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,755
What made me think like this?

167
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,645
I'll bring your belongings after work.

168
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,385
I can see through you.

169
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,995
Don't be sorry...

170
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,155
and don't be worried.

171
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:03,965
We can do this together.

172
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,295
Be brave, okay?

173
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:33,870
I'm starting to finally hear...

174
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,665
rumors about you from the financial district.

175
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:42,180
They say that the wife of some corporation's successor...

176
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:44,535
went missing.

177
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:47,250
I think it's too late now...

178
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:49,475
to make people believe it's just a rumor.

179
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,820
Are you concerned about what other people think?

180
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,245
The public...

181
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:58,255
always look forward to the collapse of a successful family.

182
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:01,855
What?

183
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,055
Are you afraid?

184
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,740
You're the opportunistic mistress of the company...

185
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,165
who used to work as a secretary.

186
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,965
I doubt it.

187
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,115
Do you think...

188
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:29,745
I don't know about what you've been up to...

189
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,655
these days?

190
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:39,295
I should've known when you brought a girl who resembled your mother.

191
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,525
I should've known how naive you are.

192
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,210
You must be crying like a baby...

193
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:50,405
to find the missing girl.

194
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,220
What?

195
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:55,875
Did you expect me to tremble in fear when you brought a girl...

196
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,550
who resembled your mother?

197
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,915
No.

198
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,390
I wanted you to feel guilty.

199
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,745
Feel guilty? Me?

200
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,615
I've always known...

201
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,255
that you would become just like me.

202
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:14,455
Think of your wife who ran away from you...

203
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:17,265
being in other man's arms.

204
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,035
Get her back now!

205
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:23,135
Or else I'll remove both of you from the family.

206
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,305
Remember to be thankful to me...

207
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,515
for making you who you are right now.

208
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,985
You arrogant scum!

209
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,515
There are too many eyes around here...

210
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,185
for you to hit your son in public, Father.

211
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,865
I'll give you 10 days.

212
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:54,235
Make sure you bring her back.

213
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,795
Is your hand okay?

214
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:34,675
At least you can see this.

215
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:47,660
Kyung Art Gallery?

216
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:48,830
Yes, Chairman.

217
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:51,130
It was just a place he used to buy a few small pieces,

218
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:54,495
but President Kang made a contract with them recently.

219
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,735
Find out...

220
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,935
- what's happening. - Okay.

221
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,985
What happened to your face?

222
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:41,690
You were never for fighting.

223
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,605
What made you change?

224
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:50,785
I heard from President Kang that...

225
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:53,355
he's going to keep the contract.

226
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,055
That's good.

227
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,765
Good morning, Doctor.

228
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,815
I know you're treating me like I don't exist.

229
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:20,690
Fine.

230
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:23,260
I'm not going to worry about you anymore.

231
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:26,330
But let's make one thing clear.

232
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,925
I'm in charge of the gallery...

233
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,540
don't even think about terminating the contract.

234
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,295
Did you tell Ma Ri beforehand...

235
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,925
about what kind of dinner she was going to?

236
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:45,635
Did you tell her that President Kang...

237
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,235
was going to be there?

238
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,645
Do you know how cruel it was...

239
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,675
for making Ma Ri face President Kang?

240
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,815
You put a fragile bird into a lion's cage.

241
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,355
A fragile bird?

242
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,395
Wake up, Jung Won.

243
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:09,365
She's not weak.

244
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:11,840
You're the one...

245
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:14,365
who is weak to the girl with Ha Kyung's face.

246
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:16,235
On the day of the contract,

247
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:19,950
she didn't seem afraid of President Kang.

248
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:21,620
You had to see it.

249
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:23,475
That's because she tried hard.

250
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:26,890
What?

251
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,815
She did it with courage.

252
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:33,855
Do you remember...

253
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,285
the small bird that came in our house through the window?

254
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,765
That bird tried hard to escape from our house,

255
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,965
and you cried because you pitied it.

256
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,565
I'm begging you.

257
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:54,035
Return to the Joo Hae Ra I know.

258
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:06,155
Do you think I cried because I pitied the bird?

259
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,155
I cried because you were crying.

260
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,295
That's why I cried.

261
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,570
The bird was never my concern.

262
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:18,635
I was only concerned about you.

263
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,035
Don't you know?

264
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,735
Don't you know why I didn't tell President Kang?

265
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,975
Do you still think it's because of the bird?

266
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,545
If President Kang knows, you'll die.

267
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,560
Do you think he'll leave you alone after you changed the face...

268
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,645
of his wife that he obsesses over?

269
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:40,985
Don't do it because of me.

270
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,000
- I'll be fine. - Fine!

271
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:45,525
I don't care if you die or not.

272
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,655
If you're going to be like this,

273
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,740
I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.

274
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:09,730
Woo Ha Kyung's house was rented under Seo Jung Won's name.

275
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:12,300
There was nothing suspicious about the contract.

276
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,355
However, regarding yesterday's disturbance...

277
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,140
The fact that they sent the cops back...

278
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:20,725
seems more suspicious to me.

279
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,825
That's because they're hiding something.

280
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,365
Come in.

281
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:33,780
I've reinforced more men.

282
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:37,405
From this moment on, report on every trivial matter...

283
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:40,715
regarding Seo Jung Won and Woo Ha Kyung's whereabouts.

284
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,185
I'll give you 10 days.

285
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,495
Make sure you bring her back.

286
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:54,255
I need to find her...

287
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:56,565
as soon as possible. I have no time.

288
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:58,795
Ma Ri,

289
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,765
where are you?

290
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:36,835
I can finally return your clothes.

291
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,835
Goodbye, then.

292
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,405
Where are you going?

293
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,475
President Kang won't be coming here.

294
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:50,585
Did that man ask you...

295
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,985
to arrange a dinner with me present?

296
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,815
Correct.

297
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,995
I don't know what he's offered,

298
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:03,995
but you should never trust him.

299
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:07,765
I don't need any advice from you.

300
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:10,110
He'll only use you.

301
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,175
You and I are different.

302
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:16,445
I know very well...

303
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,515
about people like him.

304
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:23,745
I'm going to protect my life in my own ways.

305
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,385
I'm confident.

306
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,485
That man...

307
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,430
- is more terrifying than you... - That's why...

308
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,225
you should hide well...

309
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:35,595
behind...

310
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:38,465
that face of yours.

311
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:46,535
I'm glad the contract wasn't canceled.

312
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,320
President Kang might look for Ha Kyung again.

313
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,805
- When that happens... - I believe...

314
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,075
I've told you.

315
00:31:54,796 --> 00:31:57,445
I do not want to see him anymore.

316
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:01,530
I hope you will never call me out...

317
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,655
like you did yesterday evening.

318
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,635
Ha Kyung?

319
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,085
Who was that?

320
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,955
You two know the truth.

321
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:43,365
Go on and tell me.

322
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,765
I wanted to treat you to some nice coffee,

323
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,295
but it got cold already.

324
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,575
What do you need to tell me?

325
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:35,545
Judging by how you called me here,

326
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,345
it seems like a pretty big secret.

327
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,655
There was something I haven't been able to tell you.

328
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,625
It's Ha Kyung, right?

329
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:52,665
I saw her.

330
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,505
Hae Ra told me everything.

331
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:13,155
(Choi Woo Seon)

332
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,600
Hey, did you visit my mom?

333
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:18,755
I'm with her right now.

334
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,940
I'm sorry. How is she?

335
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,725
You need to come here.

336
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:26,635
Her depression has worsened.

337
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:29,950
I'll come right away.

338
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:32,675
Tell her I'm on my way.

339
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:38,545
You've always been so composed and detached.

340
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,575
Turns out, you caused quite a mess.

341
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,015
And on top of that,

342
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,715
it's President Kang's wife.

343
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:51,885
President Kang called...

344
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,755
and wanted to see me.

345
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:59,295
Doesn't that mean he's suspecting you?

346
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,095
Please...

347
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:03,035
don't meet him.

348
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:05,475
If he visits,

349
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,150
pretend you don't know anything.

350
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:09,405
If they find out,

351
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,275
you won't be able to handle them.

352
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,215
I called you out here to ask...

353
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:19,285
if you knew any competent lawyers.

354
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,460
A lawyer?

355
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:23,485
I want to help Ma Ri live in freedom...

356
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:26,025
without fear.

357
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:30,825
She can't keep running away.

358
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,075
I want to help her fight through this.

359
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:59,700
Woo Seon, I don't think I can go there right now.

360
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:01,400
Someone's following me.

361
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,455
Please take good care of her.

362
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,495
Mom, I'm sorry.

363
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:09,240
Please...

364
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:11,325
Please hang in there a bit more.

365
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:40,000
Ma Ri, I'm at your place right now.

366
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,025
What should I bring?

367
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,340
This is...

368
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,195
just like him.

369
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:50,105
What should I do?

370
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:53,735
How can I see my mom?

371
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:29,705
You should've rested at my place. I told you I'd bring your stuff.

372
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,675
Should we take a walk?

373
00:38:37,265 --> 00:38:40,055
There are two men following us.

374
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,315
Don't look back.

375
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:45,085
There's one on that bench to the left,

376
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,625
and there's one behind you.

377
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:59,875
We need to look like a real couple.

378
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:05,175
Then...

379
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:08,175
what should we talk about?

380
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:12,245
Something a married couple would.

381
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:15,115
About how our day was today...

382
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:18,685
and if there was anything interesting or troubling.

383
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:23,265
How was...

384
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,265
your day today?

385
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,130
Kang In Wook speaking.

386
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,560
This is Ha Seong Ho from Seo and Ha Plastic Surgery.

387
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,055
Hello.

388
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,655
My secretary will tell you where we'll meet.

389
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:55,295
I'm sorry, but I have bad news.

390
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,510
I thought there wouldn't be any appointment...

391
00:39:57,512 --> 00:39:58,740
more important than ours.

392
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,765
But an emergency patient just came in.

393
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:03,510
I'm afraid I won't be able to come out today.

394
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:04,750
All right, then.

395
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:06,535
I'll call you next time.

396
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,785
Here you go.

397
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:05,495
How about moving your workroom as well?

398
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:10,505
He'll suspect us if we suddenly move all my belongings.

399
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,305
I'll keep painting here.

400
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:18,050
All right.

401
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,345
Let's just bring out the things you need.

402
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:21,715
Okay.

403
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,285
Let's take this painting.

404
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,055
Is it all done?

405
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:35,825
Yes.

406
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,495
Have you given it a name?

407
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:42,335
"A Self-Portrait Part Two".

408
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,235
"A Self-Portrait Part Two"?

409
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,805
You seem to always express yourself through flowers.

410
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:53,845
I once drew a painting of myself.

411
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:56,190
But I wasn't drawing my face,

412
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:58,845
but my tears.

413
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:01,700
That's when I realized...

414
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,830
that a self-portrait was not about...

415
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:06,825
drawing your face, but your heart.

416
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:13,695
So that's why Frida Kahlo drew that.

417
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:17,180
The deer that got shot by arrows and was bleeding to death...

418
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:19,575
was how she expressed herself.

419
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:31,015
This painting looks like...

420
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,215
darkness has passed,

421
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,755
and a bright light has appeared.

422
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:29,005
Ma Ri?

423
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:25,225
Woo Seon, it's me.

424
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,135
How is she?

425
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:30,335
That's a relief.

426
00:44:30,518 --> 00:44:33,305
If something happens, do call me.

427
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:37,205
Thank you so much.

428
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:16,405
Do you know the legend behind the Anemone?

429
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,460
Venus was shot by Cupid...

430
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:22,645
and fell in love with Adonis.

431
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:30,185
Ares was enraged by their love and turned himself into a boar.

432
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:33,395
Then, he killed Adonis who was out hunting.

433
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,365
Venus was heartbroken...

434
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:43,965
and her tears dropped on the bloodied ground.

435
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,015
The red flower that blossomed in that very place...

436
00:46:56,497 --> 00:46:57,885
was an Anemone.

437
00:47:01,936 --> 00:47:04,755
Your previous self-portrait was dark and sad,

438
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:07,725
but this one looks happy.

439
00:47:08,209 --> 00:47:10,095
I'm glad...

440
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,895
that your self-portrait looks more heartwarming.

441
00:47:21,856 --> 00:47:23,305
Would you like...

442
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,715
to have dinner with me tomorrow at a nice restaurant?

443
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,965
On my way to the train station, I thought to myself.

444
00:47:53,988 --> 00:47:55,875
I wanted to start all over again...

445
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:01,275
with you.

446
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,085
But...

447
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:11,125
I didn't know you'd be coming here this soon.

448
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,125
Tomorrow,

449
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:20,695
I'd like to officially confess my feelings to you.

450
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,935
I don't deserve...

451
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:28,620
to receive your love.

452
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,145
It's the same for me.

453
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:34,515
I'm not sure whether or not I can love again.

454
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,945
I'm afraid...

455
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,685
and hesitant.

456
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:45,325
Tomorrow,

457
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:48,125
I'll tell you why.

458
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:53,295
I still see...

459
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,835
Ha Kyung when I look at you.

460
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:59,875
I want to ask if it's okay for someone like me,

461
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,445
who still sees another woman in you, to love you.

462
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:06,875
I want to start all over again...

463
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:09,015
if you will allow me.

464
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,585
Do you know the meaning of Anemone?

465
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,785
Its legend is heartbreaking,

466
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,355
but don't be afraid.

467
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,725
Because the blood that soaked into the ground...

468
00:49:26,246 --> 00:49:28,665
blossoms into a beautiful flower.

469
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:44,445
I want to give you these flowers.

470
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:51,055
I want to give my new self-portrait to you.

471
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:53,855
It's like my Anemone.

472
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:12,645
Come in.

473
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,590
Sir, I don't know if this has any direct relations...

474
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,630
to your wife's disappearance.

475
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:21,930
What is it?

476
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,025
I came across these photos during my investigation.

477
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:27,325
Photos?

478
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,335
(President Kang In Wook)

479
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,795
(President Kang In Wook, 2 attached files)

480
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:48,475
The meaning of Anemone is...

481
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:53,960
May I Confess My Love for You?
