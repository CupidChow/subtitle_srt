1
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:31,145
If you must prove...

2
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,515
your love...

3
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:37,885
No!

4
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,835
To you, love is...

5
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,805
just a low-down obsession where you threaten her...

6
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,375
using your life as an excuse.

7
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,165
Ma Ri.

8
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:30,365
Let's leave this place.

9
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:51,095
(Episode 35: I'm Sending My Message to You)

10
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,335
We reached out our hands...

11
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,545
and finally held each other's hands.

12
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,010
We needed...

13
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:48,085
desperate courage...

14
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:51,455
to bud through rough soil.

15
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,085
Do you want me to bring your wife back?

16
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,185
- It's not too late. - Right.

17
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,255
It's not too late...

18
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,895
to be someone even worse.

19
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:38,495
To ruin everything.

20
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,205
Once everything is destroyed,

21
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,805
Let's see what's left.

22
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:28,345
It's from President Kang.

23
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,285
Let's just go.

24
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,555
Don't go too far.

25
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,955
You'll have to come back anyway.

26
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,760
Mother.

27
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,565
It's Ma Ri.

28
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,205
Call her name.

29
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,775
Ma Ri.

30
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,380
Ma Ri.

31
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,880
Ma Ri!

32
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,915
Ma Ri.

33
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,055
Where are you going when your mother is here?

34
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,975
I can't go with you.

35
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,345
Ma Ri.

36
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:31,375
I can't...

37
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,885
leave my mom here.

38
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,235
Ma Ri.

39
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:39,115
Ma Ri!

40
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:42,585
Ma Ri!

41
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,695
Get off me.

42
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,350
Mom, are you all right?

43
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:56,985
See?

44
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,320
I said you'd come back.

45
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,960
How could you use my mom?

46
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,665
Just...

47
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,335
stay with me. Just like you did before.

48
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,840
Like your mom with dementia.

49
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,875
Forget everything...

50
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,105
and stay with me.

51
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,515
I will lay down my life...

52
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,145
to take care of you.

53
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:28,085
Why are you being so scary?

54
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,755
Mom, it's okay. Everything's fine.

55
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,535
Ma Ri!

56
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,245
She must've been...

57
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:28,445
so desperate.

58
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,355
Her hands...

59
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,955
were holding mine...

60
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,755
so passionately and heavily.

61
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:01,710
A new caregiver is coming tomorrow.

62
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,380
I want to...

63
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,585
take better care of her.

64
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,290
And you will feel better that way.

65
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,950
I told you to stay away from my mom.

66
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,625
You...

67
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:13,390
broke your promise.

68
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,565
It's you who broke a promise.

69
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:17,935
You left me...

70
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,830
holding his hands.

71
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,330
You threatened me with a gun.

72
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:24,775
I just did it to hold you and to make you stay.

73
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,675
I had to.

74
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,310
Don't you see it?

75
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,005
This is...

76
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,075
against the law.

77
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,485
As if threatening and confining me isn't enough, you need my mother?

78
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,680
No.

79
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,515
I don't know anything else...

80
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,825
but the fact...

81
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,455
that you're here with me.

82
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,065
What's love?

83
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,235
It's staying with each other...

84
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,600
just like this.

85
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:57,305
Don't you think so?

86
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,445
I don't love you.

87
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,445
- What? - I...

88
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,085
don't...

89
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,085
love you.

90
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,425
I know.

91
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,625
I'm aware of that.

92
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,135
Don't say that again.

93
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,865
Never again.

94
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,770
- I... - Stop it.

95
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,835
Stop saying that.

96
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,315
You...

97
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,415
Do you...

98
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,185
love him?

99
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:57,465
Ma Ri.

100
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,865
How can you love someone else?

101
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,835
How...

102
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,675
dare you...

103
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,915
love someone else?

104
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,815
You can't...

105
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:22,555
get anything from me.

106
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,025
Neither my body or my heart.

107
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:30,895
I'll become...

108
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,635
like a dried flower...

109
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,235
and scatter like dust.

110
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,995
Ma Ri.

111
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,935
Can't you...

112
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,035
see me?

113
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,175
I'm walking...

114
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,775
on a tightrope in the air.

115
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:20,815
Can't you see that?

116
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,515
I'm afraid.

117
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,155
I'm scared...

118
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,355
of myself.

119
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,735
It's all over for us.

120
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,235
You know that too.

121
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,275
Please accept it...

122
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,945
and move on.

123
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,085
Fine.

124
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,555
Keep watching me then.

125
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,530
Me falling into the bottomless pit.

126
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:09,830
I can see it.

127
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:12,795
In the bottomless pit, me, you,

128
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,635
and even him are there...

129
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,075
all together.

130
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:40,390
He took Ma Ri back holding her mom hostage?

131
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,490
In order to free Ma Ri,

132
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:45,065
I have to take her mom to a safe place first.

133
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,500
She's in Kang In Wook's house. How would you do that?

134
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:50,935
I will do it no matter what.

135
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,315
You're here.

136
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,485
Come on in, Doctor Ha.

137
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,895
Make yourself at home.

138
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,765
Honey, you should meet him.

139
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,390
You know him.

140
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,525
He's Doctor Ha from Seo and Ha Plastic Surgery.

141
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,165
You know her.

142
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,195
She's my wife.

143
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,270
- I'll get you some tea. - I don't need tea.

144
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,905
Have a seat.

145
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:35,710
Sit.

146
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,210
Have a seat.

147
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:40,515
You and I have something to talk about.

148
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,510
I don't know why you dragged me here, but...

149
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,585
I invited you over.

150
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:48,555
I have nothing to say to you.

151
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:52,295
Do whatever you want with what I gave you on Doctor Ha.

152
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,465
I won't give you anything more regarding the hospital.

153
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,600
I won't help you anymore.

154
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,665
You won't help me?

155
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,100
Why not?

156
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,435
Did you suddenly make a friend or something?

157
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:07,410
I may not have any say in friendships.

158
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,405
But thanks to you,

159
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:12,015
after losing my job, friends, and everything,

160
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,375
I found my courage...

161
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,380
- to start over from the bottom. - You lost everything?

162
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:19,380
You've still got a lot of things.

163
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,255
Keep your courage up.

164
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,325
About the day of Woo Ha Kyung's accident.

165
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,795
Don't you remember that I know everything about it?

166
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:34,130
The fact that your girlfriend was still alive...

167
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,405
when you abandoned her to save your life.

168
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:43,175
If that fact becomes known, will you be able to deal with it?

169
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:50,945
What kind of hospital would ever let you perform surgery?

170
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:57,485
Do I really have to tell you this?

171
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:04,500
Seo Jung Won will never forgive you.

172
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,160
Who would?

173
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,130
You had an affair with his beloved wife...

174
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:12,800
and even abandoned her when she was dying.

175
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,475
Right.

176
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,870
It's all my fault.

177
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:19,340
It's my fault, so I'll deal with it.

178
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,445
So you should leave...

179
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,580
- Jung Won alone now. - Gosh, no.

180
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,520
You don't seem to catch my drift.

181
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,890
I will save your life if you take my side.

182
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:34,295
That's the only way you can survive.

183
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,905
I will destroy Seo Jung Won.

184
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,000
And you will help me...

185
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:49,505
drag him down into a bottomless pit.

186
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,710
Do you really have to do this?

187
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,955
All you need is me beside you.

188
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,025
My wife...

189
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,755
is so sweet.

190
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,060
But things are different in the world we live in.

191
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,565
If you don't want to be eaten, you have to eat them.

192
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,805
You'll be punished.

193
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,575
You will have to pay...

194
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,975
a heavy price for having a fling.

195
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,375
We all have to...

196
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,345
learn our lesson.

197
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:41,490
Jung Won, you better hide.

198
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:43,890
Let's go to the gallery for now.

199
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:47,430
- Why? - There are reporters outside.

200
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,400
The victims of medical malpractice...

201
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,400
exposed the hospital's corruption.

202
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,135
It didn't happen.

203
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,145
Well...

204
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,180
We're here to ask you about the medical malpractice.

205
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,445
Do you remember Mr. Lee Young Ho who had surgery here in 2018?

206
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,380
Please continue.

207
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,080
He suffered complications from the operation,

208
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,520
but you're trying to avoid your responsibility. Is that true?

209
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:11,425
That's not true. Then...

210
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:14,860
Do you remember Ms. Kim Jin Young who suffers from facial palsy?

211
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:18,000
There were reports that you offered a cash settlement.

212
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,130
Do you admit it?

213
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,900
Did you tamper with the records to cover up medical malpractice?

214
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:24,070
Do you admit to all the accusations?

215
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:26,370
Is it true that you offered settlement money with a memorandum?

216
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,670
Did you shrink from your responsibility?

217
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,770
Did you tamper with the medical records?

218
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:33,615
All the things you have mentioned are not true.

219
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,050
- Doctor Seo Jung Won. - Please wait.

220
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:39,420
Do you have anything to say to the victims?

221
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,650
- Please wait. - Did you offer settlement money?

222
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,490
Please tell us the truth.

223
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,425
Doctor Seo.

224
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,725
- Please make a statement. - None of this is true!

225
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,230
Ha Seong Ho.

226
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,570
He suddenly said he couldn't come to work today.

227
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,170
I don't have a good feeling about this.

228
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,400
I guess Kang In Wook...

229
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:00,070
is trying to ruin the hospital using Seong Ho.

230
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:01,810
We should request a correction of the news.

231
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,075
If it's reported in the press, the hospital will go under.

232
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:12,155
Will you just sit back and take it?

233
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:15,325
Ma Ri and her mother...

234
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,755
are being held hostage in Kang In Wook's house.

235
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,490
If I make a rash move,

236
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:22,825
they will be in danger.

237
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,505
The morning glory bloomed.

238
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,375
They rarely do.

239
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:36,470
A long time ago, there was a painter...

240
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:39,340
who lost his wife to a county magistrate.

241
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:41,545
He missed his wife...

242
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,885
until he died.

243
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:49,155
His wife heard the news and beat her breast in prison.

244
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:51,390
But in prison,

245
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,295
morning glory bloomed towards the wife.

246
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:57,895
To cheer her up.

247
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,565
To tell her that he's here.

248
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,540
He must've wanted...

249
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,170
to tell her that as a flower.

250
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:07,835
So?

251
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,505
Are you saying that you'll die?

252
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:13,780
I should disclose what needs to be known.

253
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,585
Like the morning glory.

254
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:18,085
To the world.

255
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:22,890
It will be reported in the media this evening.

256
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:25,020
Make sure to spread it wide.

257
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,360
Seo Jung Won is a respected doctor.

258
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:30,460
The whole nation should see his ugly face.

259
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,530
I will use all my connections to make it happen.

260
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:33,760
Make sure to corner him up...

261
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,600
so he won't be able to get back up again.

262
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,605
President Kang, I didn't see you at the board meeting this morning.

263
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:44,010
Board meeting?

264
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,075
I didn't hear about it.

265
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:54,355
There was a board meeting without me?

266
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,725
Darn it.

267
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,460
Why would you recruit professional management?

268
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,270
Why would you fire me?

269
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:12,535
I'll get you the herbal medicine.

270
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,945
A friend of mine told me.

271
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,315
Gunha Group is...

272
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:26,080
led by a chairman...

273
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:29,255
who's like a mob boss.

274
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,855
A mob boss?

275
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,660
That's right.

276
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,895
That's how I've led my whole life.

277
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,065
That's how the company has grown.

278
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:46,100
I can't let someone as weak as you...

279
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,540
run the company.

280
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:50,410
Gunha Construction wasn't even on the list,

281
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,010
but I took it to third place.

282
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,710
How can you run a company when you can't even handle your wife?

283
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,410
I'll...

284
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:59,755
- take care of Ma Ri. - Why would you forgive her?

285
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:03,285
You have to make her pay for what she did.

286
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,090
That's not how I taught you.

287
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:06,920
Don't worry.

288
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,190
Everything I've learned from you.

289
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,965
I'll give it all back to you.

290
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:15,805
- What? - You told me all the time.

291
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:19,800
"Don't lose a fight no matter what."

292
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,240
Money laundering.

293
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:22,710
Slush fund.

294
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,180
Connections with gangs.

295
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,315
And illegal lobbying.

296
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:29,450
I know everything.

297
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,680
If I don't use it at a time like this,

298
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,585
I will be betraying your lessons.

299
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:38,695
How dare you challenge me?

300
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:42,130
You should be flattered.

301
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,460
I'm trying...

302
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,900
to follow your teachings.

303
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,370
You're making...

304
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,435
me an enemy just for a girl?

305
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,040
A toothless lion should...

306
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:57,305
hand over the throne to a younger one.

307
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,850
I'll make sure to hold your retirement ceremony...

308
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,285
using proper formality.

309
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,250
I'm well aware of your bottom.

310
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,620
I know what makes you go berserk.

311
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,690
So you better be careful.

312
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,665
I'll throw you...

313
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:18,535
to the bottom...

314
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,265
before I get there.

315
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:32,445
You idiot!

316
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:05,375
You pathetic loser.

317
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:09,750
Because you're like this, your mom abandoned you...

318
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,015
and killed herself.

319
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:28,435
I will destroy Seo Jung Won.

320
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,535
And you will help me...

321
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,935
drag him down into a bottomless pit.

322
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:40,115
(Episode 36)

323
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:54,825
Ma Ri.

324
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:59,335
Guess what I decided today.

325
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,065
I'm going to...

326
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,535
make the company solely mine.

327
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,405
My kingdom.

328
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:09,145
I made up my mind to hold the ultimate authority...

329
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:13,115
and to become the most powerful man in the world.

330
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:14,975
Do you know why?

331
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:20,185
Because I need to protect you.

332
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,855
Ma Ri,

333
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,560
you'll become the woman of the most powerful man...

334
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,455
in the world.

335
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:30,960
I'll do everything you want.

336
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,835
I'll give...

337
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,895
everything you wish.

338
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,875
Should I tell you...

339
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:43,240
what I want?

340
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,905
Go on.

341
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,455
Don't harm...

342
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,325
Doctor Seo.

343
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,025
Then...

344
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:02,665
I'll stay by your side forever.

345
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,235
I'm sorry for saying this,

346
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,405
but he's up to something new.

347
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,180
Doctor Seo, who is known to be...

348
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:21,950
the best plastic surgeon in the country,

349
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,310
is said to have concealed a medical accident...

350
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,220
and fabricated its record...

351
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:28,190
since the opening of his hospital in 2013.

352
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,355
It's causing a huge controversy.

353
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:32,595
How...

354
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,095
How could you do this?

355
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,830
How could you be this cruel and vile?

356
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,735
You...

357
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:44,005
- You're the devil. - Right.

358
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:48,075
I'll be the devil if I must to throw him down into the abyss.

359
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,845
All I need is you by my side. I don't care if we are in the abyss.

360
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,485
Because...

361
00:28:55,851 --> 00:28:57,785
it will be my paradise.

362
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,730
- Dr. Choi. - Please say a word.

363
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,630
Do you have anything to comment?

364
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:17,700
- Is it true? - Why did you do it?

365
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:19,805
Please say a word.

366
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,145
Yes, Mother.

367
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:25,915
Don't worry.

368
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,315
There must've been a misunderstanding.

369
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:32,855
Things will be resolved soon, so don't worry.

370
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,025
Yes, Mother. Get some rest.

371
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,295
Mom.

372
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,295
What should I do?

373
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,935
Doctor Seo...

374
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:52,175
is going through a hard time because of me,

375
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,445
but there's nothing I can do about it.

376
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:00,215
He has lost and suffered so much...

377
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,715
because of me.

378
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:07,455
I at least want to ask him how he's holding up,

379
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:10,525
but I can't even call him.

380
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,895
What should I do, Mom?

381
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,105
Ma Ri.

382
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:25,065
Are you okay?

383
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,740
I'm okay,

384
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,945
so don't worry about me...

385
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,315
and please...

386
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,545
hang in there.

387
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,885
I was...

388
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,055
so scared and frightened...

389
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:42,555
by love.

390
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,225
It tears my heart like this,

391
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:49,665
but I still...

392
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:53,565
want to go back to him.

393
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:58,435
I miss him so much, Mom.

394
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:08,180
There's only one bullet in here.

395
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:09,750
In Wook.

396
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,180
In Wook, please stop.

397
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:13,420
I can prove my love for her again and again.

398
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,320
I'd rather die...

399
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:17,325
than part with you.

400
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:20,795
In Wook! Please!

401
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,300
If we reveal this to the public,

402
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,435
it will cause a huge impact.

403
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,370
But...

404
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:32,270
in order to take this to their divorce...

405
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:34,040
and to punish the assailant,

406
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,240
we need the victim's willingness to file a lawsuit...

407
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:39,415
and concrete evidence of his assault.

408
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:49,255
I'd like to encourage you...

409
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:53,295
by telling you that we already have...

410
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:56,365
the key to set you free.

411
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,690
- Hello? - Are you Mr. Seo Jung Won?

412
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,290
This is the police.

413
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:58,660
We need you to come in...

414
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,620
regarding our investigation of the medical accident.

415
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:02,865
Yes, I understand.

416
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:13,605
(Professor Kim Seok Yun)

417
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:18,275
Hello, professor.

418
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,290
I know you didn't do it.

419
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:37,765
Just think of it as one of the struggles in your career.

420
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,835
I've never forgotten your teaching.

421
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:44,330
You told me to use my medical skills to save people's hearts.

422
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:47,140
That's right, and you saved the lives of countless patients...

423
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:49,610
through your reconstructive operating skills.

424
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,980
I'm sure you'll manage to save yours too.

425
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,810
I trust you.

426
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:56,215
I hope you clear your name.

427
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,115
I'm cheering for you.

428
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,755
Thank you.

429
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,240
Where do you want to sell your paintings?

430
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:29,915
To the gallery.

431
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:36,690
I'll buy your paintings.

432
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:38,220
I told you...

433
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:40,495
I want to sell my paintings myself.

434
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:44,860
What do you want me to do?

435
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:47,135
There's nothing for you to do.

436
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:50,200
I'd like to sell them through Woo Seon.

437
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:53,105
Oh, your friend.

438
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,945
Okay.

439
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,845
I'll do it.

440
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:02,685
I'll...

441
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,855
Ms. Choi?

442
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:09,155
Yes, this is Kang In Wook.

443
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:13,495
Yes.

444
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:20,335
Oh, goodness.

445
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,500
I need your cooperation.

446
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:25,135
What?

447
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:28,100
Show me what you have in your pockets.

448
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:29,210
My gosh.

449
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,545
Is this really necessary? How heartless.

450
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,815
Here.

451
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,985
Here you go.

452
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,325
Ma Ri!

453
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:49,265
They're ready to perform the surgery tomorrow.

454
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:52,365
Everything...

455
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:56,605
will finally come back to its place.

456
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,175
Good job.

457
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,280
It's nice.

458
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:08,375
Can you put it up at the gallery?

459
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:11,815
I've got my husband's permission.

460
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,620
It's precious to me, so please.

461
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:16,090
Okay.

462
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,620
I need to take a look at it.

463
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,660
Look.

464
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,260
She said she got her husband's permission.

465
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,925
Go on.

466
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:51,550
You may take it with you.

467
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,995
That's exactly what I'll do.

468
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,205
(Trustworthy Mapo Police)

469
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:09,645
Ma Ri sent a painting. Come quickly to the gallery.

470
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:14,215
(Seoul Taxi)

471
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,865
Jung Won.

472
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:36,905
It's another piece of her series,

473
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,765
"Flower".

474
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:40,640
How did you get this?

475
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:44,440
Her friend called me, saying she couldn't reach you.

476
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,580
So I met her and got the painting from her.

477
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:48,880
Why were you out of contact?

478
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,015
I was being investigated at the police station.

479
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:53,085
I see.

480
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,385
It must've been hard.

481
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,295
It's morning glory.

482
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,665
Why did she paint morning glory?

483
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:28,580
Hoping...

484
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:31,420
someone would notice my signal for rescue.

485
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:32,560
Flowers...

486
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,265
have been my signal for rescue to the world.

487
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:38,765
Pleasant news.

488
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,865
- What? - Pleasant news.

489
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,205
That's what morning glory means.

490
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,475
Ma Ri is trying...

491
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,775
to deliver some kind of message through this painting.

492
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,375
Finally.

493
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,175
The surgery will take place today.

494
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:03,950
I'll come pick you up after taking care of urgent matters at work.

495
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:05,585
Get yourself prepared.

496
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,210
Don't worry.

497
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,350
I had a nice dream last night.

498
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,815
The surgery will go well.

499
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:13,755
I have a good feeling about it.

500
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:19,085
See you later.

501
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:36,845
Are you still looking at the painting?

502
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:43,585
Did you find anything?

503
00:41:56,831 --> 00:41:59,065
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

504
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:03,305
Don't be like that, and eat some of this.

505
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:29,130
What are you doing...

506
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,730
to this beautiful painting?

507
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:32,565
Jung Won!

508
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,820
Isn't that...

509
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,525
a memory card?

510
00:42:58,225 --> 00:43:00,695
Maybe something was recorded in it.

511
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,535
Please stop.

512
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,945
Come here!

513
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:20,640
This will be the definite evidence like the attorney said.

514
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:23,745
But it's too dangerous for you to go see him alone.

515
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:27,010
This is a copy. I want you to keep it.

516
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:30,685
If something happens to me, send it to the broadcasting station.

517
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,130
Must you do this?

518
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:47,500
They're the world's best surgeons.

519
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:49,335
Don't worry.

520
00:44:50,171 --> 00:44:53,770
Like magic, you'll have your face back...

521
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,275
when you wake up from a deep sleep.

522
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,015
I...

523
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:03,885
like this face.

524
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:07,255
That's not your face.

525
00:45:07,555 --> 00:45:08,580
It's someone else's.

526
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:11,090
I don't care whose face it is.

527
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:13,795
You know what that face means.

528
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:15,520
That face is...

529
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:19,935
Seo Jung Won's dead wife Woo Ha Kyung's...

530
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,895
that he can't get over.

531
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,205
In this face,

532
00:45:29,744 --> 00:45:32,505
I experienced true love.

533
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:45,325
Do you really think...

534
00:45:46,193 --> 00:45:47,660
that punk loves you?

535
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,230
You're wrong.

536
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:53,130
He simply loves Woo Ha Kyung's face he carved...

537
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:54,500
into your face.

538
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,000
No.

539
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,640
You know very well what kind of person his wife was.

540
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,110
This face brought him agony, not happiness.

541
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,180
It must've been so painful for him to see me,

542
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,710
but he overcame it all and loved me.

543
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,350
Instead of my face,

544
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,850
he saw my heart.

545
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,355
- Do you believe that? - Have you ever...

546
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:17,790
seen me as who I am at least once?

547
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:19,960
The only thing you see is my face.

548
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,530
And you're mistaking it for love.

549
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,860
No.

550
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,390
That man...

551
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:27,430
loved me the way I was...

552
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:30,070
regardless of how helpless I was...

553
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,565
or how messy my life was.

554
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,970
He embraced my soul,

555
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:37,575
not my looks.

556

Seo Jung Won.

559
00:46:56,831 --> 00:46:59,865
- We need to meet up right now. - Why?

560
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,130
Why do I have to meet you?

561
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:05,765
You'll desperately want to meet me once you hear this.

Ma Ri and I...

565
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,115
will wring each other's necks,

566
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:20,955
will love each other,

567
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:22,655
and will die together.

568
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:26,325
We're meant to be together.

This isn't everything.

I have more evidence to drag you down.

571
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:05,130
Isn't your hospital about to close down?

572
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,400
I guess you're doing all right so far.

573
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,295
I'm not afraid of losing my hospital...

574

people's trust.

575

Ma Ri withering in your hands.

I'm hoping that good news would bloom...

578
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,825
over the prison wall that confines me.

579
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:38,030
My dear love,

580
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:41,135
please take me.

00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:07,660
will connect our hearts together.

Go with me.

588
00:49:08,896 --> 00:49:10,230
Right.

589
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,000
This is our ending.
