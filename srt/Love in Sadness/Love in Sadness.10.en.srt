1
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:10,720
The feelings I have for her...

2
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,825
may be...

3
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,365
then perhaps...

4
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,835
I want to start...

5
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,405
all over again.

6
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:28,515
(Episode 19: I Am Happy to Know Your Heart)

7
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:44,625
Ma Ri.

8
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,425
It's me.

9
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,775
It was a mistake.

10
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,345
That I called you...

11
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,785
Ha Kyung.

12
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,525
About Hae Ra.

13
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,635
Sometimes she gets overzealous and makes mistakes.

14
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:23,035
Please forgive her.

15
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:26,465
That's what I wanted to do.

16
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,635
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.

17
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,145
And...

18
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,115
when I see you...

19
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,285
The reason...

20
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:18,325
I called you Ha Kyung earlier...

21
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,595
is because...

22
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,925
I went to my wife's grave today.

23
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:29,465
I had a deep resentment in my heart.

24
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,235
Because of those feelings,

25
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,845
Ha Kyung's name just came out of my mouth.

26
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,215
I guess...

27
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:47,785
you loved your wife a lot.

28
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,220
I did.

29
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,255
I'm glad to hear that.

30
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,820
I don't want you to be upset...

31
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,735
when you see my face.

32
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,965
To be honest,

33
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,735
I'm confused.

34
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:11,745
My feelings for you.

35
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,175
I'm not sure what they are.

36
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:20,655
I'm not sure about my feelings yet.

37
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,455
So I want to...

38
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,855
look closely at my feelings.

39
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,165
(Seo Jung Won)

40
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,455
Seo Jung Won.

41
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,485
I think...

42
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,155
I have to tell you now.

43
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,955
You've always cared for only one person...

44
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,095
with an unchanging heart.

45
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,465
So I couldn't...

46
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,135
dare to tell you this.

47
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,965
But...

48
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,275
Ha Kyung is gone now.

49
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,145
So I...

50
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:07,685
I think I can say this now.

51
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,195
I'm...

52
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,395
in...

53
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:21,765
love with you.

54
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,305
I loved you even before Ha Kyung did.

55
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,640
To you,

56
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,645
I'm just like a little sister...

57
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:40,585
or a business partner who runs the gallery with you.

58
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,755
- But I... - I'll pretend...

59
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,525
I didn't hear it.

60
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,355
Both you and I...

61
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,265
have been through a lot lately.

62
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,005
I love you.

63
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,475
I'm in love...

64
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,555
with you, Jung Won.

65
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,755
I really do.

66
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,695
I've felt this way for a long time.

67
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,995
From the moment we first met.

68
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,905
Until now.

69
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,675
The whole time.

70
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:54,995
Hae Ra.

71
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,730
You're my friend and family.

72
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,590
You were like that at first,

73
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,500
and you've been like that the whole time.

74
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:08,005
And it won't change in the future.

75
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,405
I'll forget about today.

76
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,685
But if you bring this up again,

77
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,685
I won't be able to see you anymore.

78
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,025
I don't want to lose...

79
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,255
my dear friend.

80
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,375
Why can't I?

81
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,315
Why?

82
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,385
Why can't I love you?

83
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,615
Because I'm not Ha Kyung?

84
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,480
Ha Kyung is dead.

85
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,250
She's not here anymore.

86
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,090
But you still want Ha Kyung?

87
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:05,625
Is Ha Kyung everything to you?

88
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,865
Make an appointment...

89
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,270
with Joo Hae Ra for dinner as soon as possible.

90
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,270
Can we trust...

91
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:25,145
Vice-Director Joo Hae Ra?

92
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:29,215
My gut is saying so.

93
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,085
It's like a signal from angels for me to find Ma Ri.

94
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,415
But it's also like the signal of witches...

95
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,925
leading me to confusion.

96
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:44,565
We'll see.

97
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:48,295
Whether she's our friend or enemy.

98
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,235
Or she might be a spy.

99
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,005
(Art Gallery Agreement)

100
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,085
Yes.

101
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,280
Did the operation go well?

102
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,085
Of course.

103
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,650
While you focus on reconstructive operations,

104
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,465
I'm making the majority of our profits. You know that, right?

105
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,465
I do.

106
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:23,760
The reason I called you is...

107
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,005
You have something to tell me about President Kang In Wook.

108
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:32,075
I thought it was weird when you asked me to look into him.

109
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,040
What's the matter?

110
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:36,370
Why did he come here to see you?

111
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,180
President Kang In Wook will...

112
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,245
come to see you again.

113
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,480
Please don't tell him anything about Ha Kyung.

114
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,280
What is this about?

115
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,055
It's not like one of your surgeries would've gone wrong.

116
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,260
Give me some more time...

117
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,365
to tell you what it is about.

118
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,105
Okay.

119
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:02,270
Don't keep me waiting too long though.

120
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,205
I'm worried about you.

121
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,345
Thank you.

122
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,115
I should get going.

123
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:16,810
Hello?

124
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,625
This is Kang In Wook.

125
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,965
I was going to give you a call.

126
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,760
The cultural foundation of Gunha Group...

127
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:29,960
went into partnership with Kyung Art Gallery.

128
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,300
Let's have dinner together to celebrate it.

129
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,035
Please forget about the partnership.

130
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,075
What are you talking about?

131
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,440
I've already talked about this with Director Woo Ha Kyung.

132
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,240
We're working on canceling the contract.

133
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,175
I'll call you back.

134
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,210
I'll talk to Director Woo about...

135
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,880
Our gallery is...

136
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:49,655
not interested in working with Gunha Group.

137
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,955
I'm hanging up.

138
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,215
Hae Ra. You're my friend and family.

139
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,610
You were like that at first,

140
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:20,385
and you've been like that the whole time.

141
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,855
And it won't change in the future.

142
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,365
If I were a flower,

143
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,565
I would've had a lot of meanings.

144
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,535
I would mean...

145
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,305
unchanging love...

146
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,405
or heroic ambition.

147
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,485
It's the language of flowers I've treasured like my own life.

148
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:57,185
The unwearying flower of love finally falls off...

149
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,225
and only the thorns are left.

150
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,995
They will stab me in the heart...

151
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,525
and to yours.

152
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,470
I'm just the vice-director.

153
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:23,570
Why did you want to see me?

154
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,710
I just can't leave you alone...

155
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,415
when you want to be alone.

156
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,185
Shall we go?

157
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,105
Have a seat.

158
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:56,915
Don't blame me, Jung Won.

159
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,685
Kyung Art Gallery is...

160
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,695
my dream.

161
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:14,565
The only dream I've achieved in my whole life.

162
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,935
It's not Woo Ha Kyung,

163
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,905
but me who achieved it.

164
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:25,745
You must've been dying to sign the contract.

165
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:27,840
No way.

166
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,675
That's surprising.

167
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,785
I didn't think you'd be satisfied with that little corner shop.

168
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,685
Instead of that tiny Kyung Art Gallery,

169
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,325
I can make you the director of the biggest gallery in the country.

170
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,425
If you...

171
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:50,595
cooperate with me.

172
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,935
You got me all wrong.

173
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:57,905
I don't want it...

174
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,405
if it's not Kyung Art Gallery.

175
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,710
I'm disappointed.

176
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,415
I thought you had big ambitions.

177
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,755
I do have big ambitions.

178
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,750
I want to make...

179
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:15,555
Kyung Art Gallery become the biggest art gallery in the country.

180
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,320
You're loyal. I like that.

181
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,065
So...

182
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,890
you don't want a different gallery?

183
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,900
Right. I don't.

184
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,805
Kyung Art Gallery is where I began.

185
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,715
If you want to make it the biggest art gallery,

186
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,045
I won't say no to that.

187
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,245
It's okay. Let me do it.

188
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,425
Thank you for today.

189
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:31,195
Forget about the time when you were number two, Hae Ra.

190
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,385
To be honest,

191
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,325
I'm confused.

192
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,995
My feelings for you.

193
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,525
I'm not sure what they are.

194
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:03,595
I'm not sure about my feelings yet.

195
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,305
So I want to...

196
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,745
look closely at my feelings.

197
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:40,505
I guess you loved your wife a lot.

198
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,675
I'm glad to hear that.

199
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,315
I don't want you to be upset when you see my face.

200
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:10,095
Why did you ask about Kyung Art Gallery?

201
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,300
It's nothing.

202
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:15,770
I just owe them something.

203
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,170
I think...

204
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,500
they have an eye for paintings.

205
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:23,170
But the financial situation is quite bad.

206
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,780
Well...

207
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,680
The doctor's wife is the director of the art gallery.

208
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:31,050
They even put the building up as collateral...

209
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,620
to run the art gallery.

210
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:35,050
So...

211
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:38,220
don't even think about working with them.

212
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:40,465
Okay?

213
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:18,535
(Patient: Kim Ji Min)

214
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:53,265
(Thread Cleaners)

215
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,280
Hello, Ma Ri. This is Joo Hae Ra.

216
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:09,410
Hello. I was going to give you a call.

217
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:12,250
I should return the dress and shoes.

218
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:16,850
Then will you have dinner with me tonight?

219
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,625
Okay.

220
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:22,265
I'll text you about the time and place.

221
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,135
Something came up, so I'll be a little late.

222
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,645
Take your time.

223
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:06,500
To celebrate the partnership between Gunha Group and Kyung Art Gallery,

224
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:09,205
I arranged a dinner for us.

225
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,905
I heard Joo Hae Ra is coming late.

226
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,430
You look like a different person...

227
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,395
from the one I met before.

228
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:41,065
Which one is your true face?

229
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,705
I was working on my painting.

230
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:52,840
It's embarrassing that I look like this.

231
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,285
You're not wearing the wedding ring.

232
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,055
Today.

233
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:04,995
I don't wear it when I paint.

234
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,665
And you're not wearing the scarf.

235
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,895
How did you know I was here?

236
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,105
I heard from Hae Ra.

237
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,875
Documents for canceling the contract.

238
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,740
Why would you cancel the contract?

239
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,170
I have to.

240
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:56,270
I prepared it with my attorney.

241
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:58,140
- So sign the document and... - Move over.

242
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,685
I'm going to meet President Kang In Wook.

243
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,480
And I'm going to celebrate the contract with him...

244
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:05,320
popping champagne.

245
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,780
Don't go there. I canceled the dinner.

246
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:10,450
No, you didn't cancel it.

247
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:14,320
There's one more guest Kang In Wook wants to see,

248
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,335
so I called her.

249
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:44,490
Something came up, so Vice-Director Joo Hae Ra won't make it today.

250
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:46,460
So did you change your mind?

251
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,695
Are you here to celebrate our contract?

252
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:54,205
The documents for the cancellation.

253
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:59,145
There's nothing to celebrate, so we should get going.

254
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,375
Let's go.

255
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,485
Is Director Woo Ha Kyung okay with that?

256
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:15,850
I wonder if you really don't mind...

257
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:18,555
the compensation you have to pay for the cancellation.

258
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,020
You don't have to worry about our gallery.

259
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:23,535
I'm asking Director Woo Ha Kyung.

260
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,765
Are you with him?

261
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,640
Doctor Seo also...

262
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:35,170
wants to revive the gallery,

263
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,115
but he just can't ask you a favor.

264
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,625
Let's have dinner.

265
00:26:58,433 --> 00:26:59,460
Have a seat.

266
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:14,185
(Episode 20)

267
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,945
You two look great together.

268
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,210
Thank you.

269
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:47,610
I hope you're happy with your family too.

270
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:49,680
I'd like to,

271
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:52,385
but it's just that my wife vanished.

272
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:54,450
On a street...

273
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,225
on a rainy night.

274
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,525
Just like that.

275
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:05,365
I'm sorry.

276
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,505
It's not going to last long.

277
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,505
She's going to come back soon.

278
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,315
By the way,

279
00:28:17,412 --> 00:28:20,285
it's so hard to understand women.

280
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,980
I give her love,

281
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:24,885
but she doesn't realize it.

282
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:28,325
Why do you think...

283
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:31,025
my wife is like that?

284
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,430
Maybe...

285
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,365
it wasn't love.

286
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:43,175
If it was true love,

287
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,945
she must've felt your sincerity.

288
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:55,010
My wife...

289
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:56,955
is fragile.

290
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,920
As if she'll fly away somewhere.

291
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:02,695
So I tried to protect her,

292
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:05,795
and she used to whine how suffocating it was.

293
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:11,760
You pick a flower to keep it,

294
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,835
and the flower is bound to wither.

295
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:19,405
You catch a butterfly, and its wings shatter.

296
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,985
You sound like you know well about me and my wife.

297
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,095
Why don't we stop talking about your wife?

298
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:40,795
Go ahead and eat.

299
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:51,570
Well, I'll be able to go back to my happy marriage...

300
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:54,145
like the two of you soon.

301
00:29:57,412 --> 00:30:00,185
Because I've found my wife.

302
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,055
I'm going to go see her.

303
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,425
Right away...

304
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,665
tomorrow.

305
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:50,965
I really enjoyed our dinner today.

306
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,805
But I haven't gotten your answer yet, Ms. Woo.

307
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,705
Are we canceling...

308
00:30:58,874 --> 00:30:59,940
this contract?

309
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,745
I clearly told you we're canceling the contract.

310
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:12,150
I'll be looking forward...

311
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:13,955
to working with you.

312
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,595
What are you doing?

313
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:23,065
Pleasure is mine.

314
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,935
Ms. Woo.

315
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,105
See you around.

316
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:06,175
Why did you go see him?

317
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:10,845
The gallery issue has nothing to do with you.

318
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,110
Do you know how dangerous that was?

319
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:16,555
Your wife used to run the art gallery.

320
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,680
I wanted to be of help.

321
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,620
It was the only thing I could do.

322
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,325
You escaped in order to survive.

323
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,860
Why did you see him again because of me?

324
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,290
I'm fine...

325
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:30,265
as long as I can repay your kindness.

326
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:32,235
I...

327
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:35,330
was happy that I could finally do something for you.

328
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,005
You were happy?

329
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:39,670
Don't you realize what I want?

330
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:43,345
It's for you to be safe, away from danger so I won't worry about you.

331
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,715
Why would you walk into danger?

332
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,855
That's how I am.

333
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:57,125
I'm a complete mess.

334
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,295
That's how I've been.

335
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,460
I chose a horrible man as my husband.

336
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:06,000
I ruined my life.

337
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:08,435
And my foolish decision is...

338
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,905
causing trouble...

339
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,545
to someone so nice like you.

340
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,945
It's always...

341
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,145
my fault.

342
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:21,610
It isn't your fault.

343
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,255
You better leave my side too.

344
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:26,655
Or you'll face misfortunes.

345
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,705
Don't go.

346
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:47,045
I'm not angry at you.

347
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,275
I'm just surprised.

348
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:55,015
I'm to blame for changing your face into Ha Kyung's.

349
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:59,785
So even if Kang In Wook visits the gallery or asks for Ha Kyung,

350
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,425
don't face him.

351
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:06,190
I'll take care of the gallery.

352
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,565
Being with me...

353
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,965
might put you in danger.

354
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:14,935
I'm fine.

355
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,405
I want you...

356
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,775
to smile as you live your life.

357
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:27,585
I want you to be free.

358
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:15,965
- Let's go. - Okay.

359
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,255
Don't worry about the art gallery.

360
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:44,125
I tell Hae Ra.

361
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:47,795
You won't have to play Ha Kyung anymore.

362
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:50,865
So stop doing it.

363
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:53,005
That's...

364
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:56,305
not for me.

365
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,885
Hae Ra said...

366
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:11,280
that you fell in love with your wife...

367
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:13,755
at first sight.

368
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:17,025
Right.

369
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,765
I was wrong.

370
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:24,160
I thought you eventually came to love her...

371
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:28,635
because you're a careful man.

372
00:36:31,806 --> 00:36:33,875
There was one moment...

373
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:38,545
that was worth...

374
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,515
the rest of my life.

375
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:55,395
Does seeing someone's face...

376
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,705
hold such a huge meaning?

377
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:04,705
You get to find hope...

378
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,845
from their face...

379
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:16,015
even if it's a foolish misunderstanding...

380
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:21,855
or a huge mistake.

381
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:26,995
How do you feel, seeing my face then?

382
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,595
Have you found any hope?

383
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:12,570
Goodnight.

384
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:14,775
Take care.

385
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,185
Ms. Woo?

386
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:55,825
Ms. Woo.

387
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:41,135
Ma Ri.

388
00:43:43,104 --> 00:43:44,805
Ma Ri?

389
00:43:47,475 --> 00:43:49,645
I know you're here.

390
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:53,745
Come out now.

391
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:58,455
Let's go home.

392
00:44:00,755 --> 00:44:02,655
Yoon Ma Ri.

393
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:20,405
Ma Ri.

394
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,070
I know you hid her.

395
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,245
Where is she? Where is she?

396
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:47,435
Tell me. Tell me!

397
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,740
What are you doing?

398
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,410
The person you're looking for.

399
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:04,180
She isn't here,

400
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:06,185
President Kang.

401
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,955
I don't believe you.

402
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:13,965
A hospital director and an art gallery director.

403
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:16,935
What are you doing at this shabby rooftop studio?

404
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:20,335
This is...

405
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,735
my workroom.

406
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:27,075
I'm not a fool.

407
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:32,645
See?

408
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,110
Ma Ri was here.

409
00:45:35,116 --> 00:45:38,485
Ma Ri painted these.

410
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,685
I know it.

411
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:45,225
Ms. Woo.

412
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:48,695
Where is she?

413
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:52,360
Where is Ma Ri?

414
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:55,405
Where is my wife?

415
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:10,015
Who are you?

416
00:46:13,754 --> 00:46:15,625
What are you?

417
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:18,025
How... Why do you...

418
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,825
You...

419
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:21,695
You...

420
00:46:22,096 --> 00:46:25,065
Who are you?

421
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:27,705
Enough!

422
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:38,245
It's okay.

423
00:46:38,813 --> 00:46:40,585
Goodness.

424
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,590
Ma Ri.

425
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:53,625
Call the police.

426
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:10,475
How dare you make a fool out of me?

427
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:14,985
You two know the truth.

428
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:17,585
Go on and tell me.

429
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,855
Tell me now!

430
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:30,660
Is this the police?

431
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:32,030
Someone...

432
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:33,830
Someone broke into my house.

433
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:37,075
Hurry here, please.

434
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,550
Do you want to know the truth?

435
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:59,120
You're a filthy scum who abuses women that are weak.

436
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,290
That is the truth.

437
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,530
What do you know?

438
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,230
We must leave, sir.

439
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:08,805
Let go of me!

440
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:10,500
Sir.

441
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:11,900
Ma Ri is here.

442
00:48:11,906 --> 00:48:13,140
People are watching.

443
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,510
Ma Ri is here!

444
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,710
Sir, we must leave.

445
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:19,640
- Let go! - Hurry.

446
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,110
- Let go of me! - Hold him.

447
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:22,710
We must hurry and leave, sir.

448
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:25,280
- No! - Sir.

449
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:28,125
Let go of me!

450
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,100
Ma Ri was there.

451
00:49:52,106 --> 00:49:53,905
Ma Ri...

452
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:56,975
Woo Ha Kyung...

453
00:49:57,544 --> 00:49:59,515
was hiding her.

454
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:02,685
But why...

455
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:06,055
Why...

456
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:08,955
Why did Woo Ha Kyung...

457
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:11,690
Why, why, why?

458
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,195
Why?

459
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:30,445
Why...

460
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:32,545
Why...

461
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:37,685
Why?

462
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,345
The moment he embraced me, my frozen heart melted.

463
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:07,015
It was as if he wanted us...

464
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:09,715
to hang on and love again.

465
00:51:10,217 --> 00:51:12,755
A flower is blooming inside...

466
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:16,425
like the red, burning sunset.

467
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,760
I Am Happy to Know Your Heart.

468
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,935
(I Am Happy to Know Your Heart)

469
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,380
(Love in Sadness)

470
00:51:44,384 --> 00:51:46,450
Why did you do it?

471
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:49,250
Why did you do it, Ha Kyung?

472
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:50,890
But...

473
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:53,425
I'm not her.

474
00:51:53,594 --> 00:51:56,595
I'm not your wife.

475
00:51:57,564 --> 00:51:58,830
Mr. Seo.

476
00:51:58,832 --> 00:52:00,565
I'm sorry.

477
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:03,735
Please...

478
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:07,005
change my face again.
