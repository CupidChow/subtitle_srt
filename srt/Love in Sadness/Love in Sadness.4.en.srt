1
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:11,555
There are a lot of branches. Be careful.

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,655
- Look in every nook and corner. - Do you see anything?

3
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,395
Search carefully.

4
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,115
They found the bag.

5
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,480
If he found out that I'm alive,

6
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,515
what am I going to do?

7
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:17,385
What do I do now?

8
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,095
(Episode 7: Tell Me)

9
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,430
I'm Oh Cheol Young who gave you a call.

10
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:30,505
After I got your call, I checked it in advance.

11
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:32,670
It's like playing detective. This is amazing.

12
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,070
Is it?

13
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:37,005
Help us catch the criminal then.

14
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:41,850
Here. Do you see this serial number?

15
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,150
This is our dress.

16
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:47,050
Speaking of which, I need to check the customer list for this dress.

17
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:49,390
Pardon. That's...

18
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:52,025
Why? I can't?

19
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,460
Once we increase surveillance and start a compulsory search,

20
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:57,400
you'll be in bigger trouble.

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,835
- All right then. - No, please wait for a moment.

22
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:36,465
It's a limited edition dress, and there are 30 purchasers.

23
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:40,505
It's a dress of great value, so they all would still have it.

24
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:44,840
We confirmed that these three still have the dress.

25
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:46,580
We can single out a suspect...

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,245
by narrowing them down to one.

27
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,585
I'll be back then.

28
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,315
Yoon Ma Ri.

29
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:45,340
Hello? What do you think this is?

30
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,810
This is Kang In Wook.

31
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,305
Kang In Wook or whatever...

32
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,845
I'm Ma Ri's husband.

33
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,160
I'll appreciate your help.

34
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,030
Okay. Sure.

35
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:10,300
Once Ma Ri calls me,

36
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,435
you will be the first one to know that.

37
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,155
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,925
- Sir. - Wait.

39
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,075
Here.

40
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:12,860
President Kang.

41
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,695
Let's move on to the next purchaser.

42
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,055
I already gave her a call.

43
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,920
Why is it so hard for the three of us to get together?

44
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,745
It's been so long.

45
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:42,815
That's because Doctor Seo's busy.

46
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,985
Isn't that because of your busy schedule?

47
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,860
That's not my fault.

48
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,630
I want to rest too.

49
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,830
Then you should say this from time to time.

50
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,730
"You don't need this surgery."

51
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:57,070
You always say that you can do it.

52
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,005
It's not like you're a money-grubber.

53
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:02,835
You like Jung Won, don't you?

54
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:05,640
What are you talking about?

55
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,645
You always take his side.

56
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,415
That's...

57
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,320
Don't you know that we grew up like brother and sister?

58
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:20,385
No, not like that. I mean, as a man.

59
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,225
Gosh.

60
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,800
Have I lost my mind?

61
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,370
He only cares about his wife even when she's dead.

62
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:30,740
Gosh.

63
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,805
Why are you upset? Whatever.

64
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,705
Doctor Seo.

65
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,075
Did you recently do surgery on someone without telling me?

66
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,785
It's a little disappointing.

67
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,855
Who is the VIP that you'd keep it secret from me?

68
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,190
You're supposed to keep things secret because they're a secret.

69
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,065
Why would you pry?

70
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,735
I should get going.

71
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,180
You know how he feels now.

72
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,880
He must miss Ha Kyung a lot.

73
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,785
Can't you just let it go?

74
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,825
I'm also sad that Ha Kyung died.

75
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,165
It might be a good chance for you.

76
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,905
You liked Jung Won even before he met Ha Kyung.

77
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:40,610
If you have a secret crush, do it right.

78
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,675
You're not supposed to show it. You're such an amateur.

79
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,145
I didn't show anything.

80
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,480
I think it's one of these two.

81
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,115
Number one.

82
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,985
Jung Won knows everything, but he pretends not to know it.

83
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,650
Number two. Jung Won...

84
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,620
only cares about Ha Kyung,

85
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,390
so he really doesn't know.

86
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,890
Number three.

87
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,065
Ha Kyung is the only love of Jung Won's life.

88
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:07,170
And it's fine by me.

89
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,335
So I like Jung Won.

90
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,205
It's number four.

91
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,005
Both of you are crazy.

92
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,845
I'm Oh Cheol Young who called you about the dress.

93
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,455
- Is this it? - Yes.

94
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,925
President Kang, I think this is it.

95
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,825
Thank you.

96
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:02,215
(Employment placement agency)

97
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,590
Hello. I heard you are looking for an employee.

98
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:12,555
We already found one.

99
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:21,570
(Wanted: a waitress)

100
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,795
I came here for this job.

101
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,305
Not even one position?

102
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,190
Hey, Miss. You have nowhere to go?

103
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,320
Do you want to come with us and have a drink?

104
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,760
I know a good place.

105
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,260
Hey.

106
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,460
Hey, let's have fun together.

107
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,730
Hey, we have a big umbrella here.

108
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,730
You don't even have an umbrella.

109
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,270
Here's an umbrella.

110
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,600
Hey.

111
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,770
My gosh.

112
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,970
Hey, Miss.

113
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,875
Why are you...

114
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:54,995
Hello?

115
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:57,600
Hey! What are you going to do?

116
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,930
This is an expensive suit. This is a limited edition.

117
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:02,330
Gosh, please stay quiet.

118
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,665
Her family is coming over.

119
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,910
So why did you complicate the situation?

120
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,605
I won't let her get away with it.

121
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:12,240
This is an expensive suit.

122
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,710
How dare you...

123
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:16,315
Darn it.

124
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,245
I have a witness.

125
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,790
Hey.

126
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,715
Are you Mr. Seo Jung Won?

127
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:27,790
- Yes. - It seems like...

128
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,660
a drunk man provoked her to a quarrel.

129
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,800
I guess his suit got ruined a little while she scuffled with him.

130
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:35,135
She could've just given him some money,

131
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,870
but she wouldn't say a word.

132
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,500
I asked her over and over again...

133
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,905
to get your number.

134
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,905
Do you know her?

135
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,235
How have you been?

136
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,875
Well...

137
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:25,985
I've been around looking for a job.

138
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:30,015
I can do anything if they hire me.

139
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,725
I thought...

140
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:38,695
I'd be able to do anything with a new face.

141
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,335
But...

142
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,805
it turns out there isn't much I can do.

143
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,335
I thought I would be...

144
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:54,875
free once I change my face.

145
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,715
With a new face,

146
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,150
I thought...

147
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,725
I would be able to get away from him.

148
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,525
But I can't.

149
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,325
I'm still scared...

150
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,895
and pathetic.

151
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,105
I feel lost.

152
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,285
Eat it when it's warm.

153
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:04,415
(Chicken soup, pork rib hangover soup, pork backbone stew)

154
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:18,295
We have 10 people left.

155
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:21,165
Give me.

156
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:25,400
(Purchaser list)

157
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,805
(Woo Ha Kyung)

158
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,745
Let's call it a day. I'll see you tomorrow.

159
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:55,995
Ma Ri...

160
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,705
Ma Ri is out there.

161
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,475
It's raining now.

162
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,845
She must be really cold.

163
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,985
She must be terrified.

164
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,395
Where are you?

165
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,725
Where are you, Ma Ri?

166
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,205
Come in.

167
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,505
Then...

168
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,145
I'll be in your debt.

169
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,625
This way.

170
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,605
There's nothing in this room.

171
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,945
I'll buy things you need tomorrow.

172
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,975
Get some rest then.

173
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,810
You're up?

174
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,375
I've been trying to keep quiet.

175
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,920
I'm sorry. I didn't even ask you.

176
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:02,655
I just wanted to make you breakfast.

177
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,395
It's okay. It smells good.

178
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:12,295
The food is ready. I'll just put the soup in a bowl.

179
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:41,725
Are these from my fridge?

180
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,030
Yes.

181
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:45,400
I just made them with the ingredients you have.

182
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,160
I hope you'll like them.

183
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,795
Of course, I will.

184
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,635
I don't even know how long it's been.

185
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,910
Since I had breakfast with someone like this.

186
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,480
I'll make your breakfast every day.

187
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,705
Please let me do that while I stay here.

188
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,050
I'm a good cook.

189
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:07,280
I used to be a full-time housewife.

190
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,120
No, you don't have to do this.

191
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,490
Please let me at least do that.

192
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:12,660
Then...

193
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:16,395
I'll be more comfortable staying here.

194
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,055
Please.

195
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,565
Thank you.

196
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,700
While you stay here,

197
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:30,375
I want you to feel comfortable and plan for the future.

198
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,575
Okay. I'll do that.

199
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,355
By the way,

200
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:48,625
can I ask you something?

201
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:56,635
Did your wife go somewhere?

202
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,840
I shouldn't have asked that.

203
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,535
I'm sorry.

204
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,530
- Good morning. - You're early.

205
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,100
I should work hard.

206
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,765
The gallery is going through a financial crisis.

207
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:39,040
(Seo and Ha Plastic Surgery)

208
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,075
Any hope with this artist is done for.

209
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,110
Why?

210
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:44,680
I can't reach her.

211
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,420
I'm sure another gallery contacted her.

212
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:51,085
I think I lost to my rivals even before I knew it.

213
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,555
Because you can't hide your light under a bushel.

214
00:21:56,699 --> 00:22:00,325
And there's a secret you can't hide.

215
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,165
Going up.

216
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:08,870
The doors are closing.

217
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:10,370
(Seo and Ha Plastic Surgery)

218
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:14,305
So you finally performed the surgery on her, right?

219
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,410
What?

220
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,250
The woman who asked you...

221
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,220
to change her face to get away from her husband.

222
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,820
Am I wrong?

223
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:24,760
I heard a patient without a name was hospitalized for a month.

224
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,890
So I was curious who she was.

225
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:29,530
And it occurred to me last night.

226
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:32,225
Right, that's her.

227
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,365
She was an emergency patient.

228
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,930
I guess she was thinking about killing herself.

229
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,800
It was about a month ago.

230
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,905
Was it around Ha Kyung's funeral?

231
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:42,775
It was that day.

232
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:45,175
That's why I wanted to help her.

233
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:49,075
I can't believe this.

234
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:52,920
So you're Seo Jung Won Theresa.

235
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,615
You're such a philanthropist.

236
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,600
If you find the painter, ask her if she wants to sell it.

237
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:09,465
I want to meet the painter too.

238
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:18,975
I'm sure there are more paintings of flowers.

239
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:23,875
Flowers that beckon people to take a look at them.

240
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,655
Can't you just look at me?

241
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,885
Now that Ha Kyung is gone, can't you...

242
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,355
What am I doing?

243
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,065
Where's your pride?

244
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,185
I'm back.

245
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,825
Hey.

246
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,125
I heard you're busy these days.

247
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,495
You're busy with your new business...

248
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,505
and busy looking for your wife.

249
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,805
I'll take care of everything without making any mistakes.

250
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,645
Your mother...

251
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:29,415
was a very nice person.

252
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,485
She ran away numerous times,

253
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,715
but she eventually came back.

254
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:41,125
With black and blue bruises all over her body,

255
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,955
she came back home with a limp.

256
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,635
Why do you think she did that?

257
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:53,000
Please don't talk about Mom.

258
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,210
It was because of you.

259
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,735
She had no one but you to turn to.

260
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:03,245
No one understands you, but I do.

261
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:06,215
You take after me to the bone.

262
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,120
Have a baby as soon as your wife comes back.

263
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:14,560
Once she has a baby, she can't run away from you.

264
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:18,325
She will come back even if she gets beaten to death.

265
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,545
Call your mom.

266
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:09,045
Tell her to come back now.

267
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:56,125
You take after me to the bone.

268
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,595
No. No!

269
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,105
Ma Ri.

270
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,875
Please come back.

271
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,745
Come back and comfort me.

272
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:30,495
Come back...

273
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:35,025
and console me.

274
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:38,395
Now!

275
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:47,675
(Find a job, prepare for a contest, go to Woo Seon)

276
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,985
I can do this.

277
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,385
Everything will be fine.

278
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:08,270
Let's survive and live a happy life.

279
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,195
You and me.

280
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,175
What are you doing?

281
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,945
You're home.

282
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:30,415
I was looking for a vacuum.

283
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:32,955
I'll take it out.

284
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:56,350
I'll do this.

285
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,525
He seems fine on the outside, but I doubt it.

286
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,400
He must be in shock.

287
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:19,165
You know he always keeps his worries inside.

288
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:23,535
He must be doing the same about Ha Kyung's death.

289
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,145
Exactly.

290
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:33,185
He hasn't reported her death either.

291
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,420
Okay, I understand.

292
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:39,585
I'll take good care of him. Don't worry, Mom.

293
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,285
Are you home?

294
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,265
Who are you?

295
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,585
Ha...

296
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,025
Ha Kyung?

297
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,975
Let's talk outside.

298
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,315
Ha Kyung is dead.

299
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,055
So how...

300
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:56,695
How is this possible?

301
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,680
Explain.

302
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,745
What did I just see?

303
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:18,320
It's a long story to tell. Let's go talk somewhere.

304
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
Explain it here. Who is she?

305
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:23,255
The woman with Ha Kyung's face. Who is she?

306
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,095
Tell me...

307
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,035
it's not what I'm imagining. It's not true, is it?

308
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,005
What...

309
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:52,075
have you done?

310
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:12,200
Is there a certain face that you'd like?

311
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,835
You know what?

312
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,735
If you have a face that you like,

313
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:19,375
feel free to make me look like it.

314
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:25,315
Did your wife go somewhere?

315
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:31,685
I shouldn't have asked that.

316
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,325
I'm sorry.

317
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,430
I was just wondering...

318
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,565
if I could stay here without her permission.

319
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:46,505
My wife...

320
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,275
passed away.

321
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,505
I suffered for a long time,

322
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,185
and I think my mother got rid of all her pictures...

323
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:03,255
in case they'd remind me of her again.

324
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,295
What are you doing?

325
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:37,515
What were you thinking?

326
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,190
You've done something crazy.

327
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:43,295
Are you aware of that?

328
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,195
If people find out,

329
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,465
then...

330
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:53,735
you'll lose your medical license.

331
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:45,955
I think I know...

332
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:48,385
whom...

333
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:50,995
I look like.

334
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:19,185
What do you want me to do now?

335
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:22,995
Just...

336
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:26,425
act like you don't know.

337
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,005
What about you?

338
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,605
What will you do?

339
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:41,205
I'll be cheering on that woman...

340
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,215
who looks like Ha Kyung.

341
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:47,815
So that she can be happy at least from now on.

342
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,195
Ma Ri.

343
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:20,205
I know...

344
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,535
whose face I have.

345
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:27,375
I finally found the reason...

346
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:29,875
why you looked surprised...

347
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:33,615
when the bandage was removed from my face.

348
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,555
I'm sorry.

349
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,285
I'm not mad at you.

350
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,595
I was the one who said I was okay...

351
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,265
with any face.

352
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:08,615
I think...

353
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,720
it was a miracle...

354
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:14,155
that you came to me that day.

355
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,725
A miracle given by a deity...

356
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,495
so that I could...

357
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,295
live my life anew.

358
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,605
And I'm grateful for it.

359
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:33,105
You saved me.

360
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:39,115
Your wife...

361
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:43,355
must've been wise and brave.

362
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,020
I want to...

363
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,625
be that kind of person too.

364
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:52,660
I won't go back to being my old self...

365
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:56,435
who went in hiding and ran away out of fear.

366
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,395
So...

367
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:01,135
don't be sorry.

368
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:16,785
I don't think...

369
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:21,225
I can stay by your side in this face.

370
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:26,195
Otherwise, you'll be faced with difficulties.

371
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,595
Seeing my face...

372
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,935
will be a torture for you too.

373
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,935
I can deal with it.

374
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,835
You may stay...

375
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:40,005
until you find something stable.

376
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:41,980
No.

377
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:45,575
I shouldn't put my savior in trouble.

378
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,645
I'll leave.

379
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:56,655
Why don't we have dinner together for the last time tomorrow?

380
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:00,800
I want to serve you a decent meal.

381
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,735
Let me show off my cooking skills in a while.

382
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:46,875
She looks like her.

383
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:50,375
So much like her.

384
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:18,335
I was quite stunned yesterday.

385
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:20,575
Ha Kyung...

386
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,180
was my long-time friend.

387
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:26,985
Jung Won first met her because of me too.

388
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:31,085
I watched the two the longest of all.

389
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:35,385
Ha Kyung is the only love in Jung Won's life.

390
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:37,895
She was in a coma...

391
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,195
for five years due to a car accident.

392
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:44,735
He was devoted to her like always even during that time.

393
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,575
The night when he operated on your face...

394
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:51,705
That day...

395
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:55,475
was Ha Kyung's funeral.

396
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,915
Jung Won...

397
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,385
is a thoughtful man,

398
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:06,485
but that day, he suffered a mental breakdown...

399
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:09,185
which made him...

400
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:12,595
do something unacceptable.

401
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:15,565
He created someone...

402
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:19,035
who'd replace Ha Kyung.

403
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,640
I pity you...

404
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:26,675
for having your face changed into hers without knowing any of this.

405
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,875
The result...

406
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:36,115
may be considered that way.

407
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:41,455
But I have no intention of blaming him.

408
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,495
He saved my life.

409
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:48,765
I am...

410
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:51,195
truly grateful to him.

411
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,005
Did you say your name is Yoon Ma Ri?

412
00:44:57,344 --> 00:44:59,740
His feelings aren't for you.

413
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,845
Don't be mistaken.

414
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:07,245
Please forgive...

415
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:09,350
Jung Won.

416
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,885
Overlook his foolish mistake,

417
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:15,255
and leave...

418
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,855
quietly.

419
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,465
Please smile with that face...

420
00:45:54,535 --> 00:45:56,635
from now on.

421
00:45:58,105 --> 00:46:00,470
Cherish...

422
00:46:00,474 --> 00:46:02,365
and love yourself.

423
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:08,605
No one is more precious than yourself.

424
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:11,275
His warm comfort.

425
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:23,455
His kind consideration.

426
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,735
His happy heart.

427
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:38,335
Everything...

428
00:46:38,746 --> 00:46:42,205
was for the owner of this face.

429
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:32,555
Welcome home.

430
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:38,395
I wanted to dress up for our dinner,

431
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:42,335
so I wore this dress without your permission.

432
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,975
It looks good on you,

433
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:53,145
but please don't make me surprised.

434
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:56,615
The princess sheds tears for losing someone she loves.

435
00:47:57,224 --> 00:48:00,425
And the lavender blooms where her tears have dropped.

436
00:48:00,895 --> 00:48:04,795
Lavender means, "Tell me."

437
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:09,025
His warm eyes are gazing at the face,

438
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,235
but whose face is it?

439
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:15,335
I know I can't, but my heart insists on asking.

440
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:32,255
Thank you for your cooperation. Bye.

441
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:37,195
There are only two left now.

442
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:42,595
(Purchaser list)

443
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,535
(Joo Hae Ra, Woo Ha Kyung)

444
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:58,480
I'm Oh Cheol Young, who called you earlier.

445
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:00,315
Thank you for your cooperation.

446
00:49:03,324 --> 00:49:05,055
Let's go in.

447
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:20,265
It's been confirmed that you purchased the same dress.

448
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:22,400
Can we take a look at your dress?

449
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:24,910
Why do you need it?

450
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:28,145
It's an important clue to a missing person case.

451
00:49:57,878 --> 00:49:59,580
Are you going to buy that one too?

452
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,175
You too?

453
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:10,385
Did Jung Won lend Ha Kyung's dress to that woman?

454
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,000
What's the matter?

455
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,305
Is Ms. Woo Ha Kyung inside?

456
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:33,445
Why are you...

457
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:35,975
looking for my wife?

458
00:50:46,894 --> 00:50:48,925
Where is your wife?

459
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:54,460
Tell me.

460
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,365
(Lavender, Tell me.)

461
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:11,180
(Love in Sadness)

462
00:51:11,185 --> 00:51:13,920
I'll find you however you look or wherever you hide.

463
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,920
So you better give up on running away from me.

464
00:51:16,924 --> 00:51:18,690
Is that woman all you think about?

465
00:51:18,692 --> 00:51:20,360
What does Ma Ri mean to you?

466
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,420
You're doing this because she looks like Ha Kyung.

467
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:24,730
What? That's not it.

468
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:27,160
Ms. Woo. You know me, don't you?

469
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,100
Why act like you don't, when you do?

470
00:51:29,103 --> 00:51:31,470
Ma Ri. Ma Ri.

471
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:33,095
Honey.
