1
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:23,365
Change...

2
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,835
my face again.

3
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,065
To a different face from this.

4
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,675
I can't stand the fact that...

5
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,645
you're struggling...

6
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,585
every time...

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,185
you see my face.

8
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,955
Please...

9
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,595
change my face again.

10
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,425
I beg you.

11
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:05,905
If you ask me once more...

12
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,875
about what face I want to change to,

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,175
I want to have a face that lets me stay beside you,

14
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,845
and a face...

15
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,315
that lets me love you.

16
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:24,755
(Episode 25: If You'd Let Me, I Want to Love Again)

17
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,025
It's mint tea.

18
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,235
It will help soothe you.

19
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,315
Just like you said,

20
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,315
the longest stem of the rosemary...

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,785
was not a coincidence.

22
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,425
Ha Kyung chose me...

23
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,295
as her husband.

24
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,265
But for our entire marriage,

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,035
she lied to me.

26
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,965
I don't think I can...

27
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:13,005
forgive my wife.

28
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,215
You're right.

29
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,245
I saw Ha Kyung...

30
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,015
from you, Ma Ri.

31
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,055
There were times I missed her.

32
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,955
There were also times I resented her.

33
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:38,295
But on that day,

34
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:43,705
I wanted to say this to you at the restaurant.

35
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,975
Are you okay with the kind of person I am?

36
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,985
The kind who sees another person...

37
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:00,015
from your face, Ma Ri.

38
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,225
Are you okay with that?

39
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,595
You can answer...

40
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,535
when you are ready.

41
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,975
Ma Ri.

42
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,705
Ma Ri!

43
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,115
It's just a dream.

44
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,085
Everything is fine.

45
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,795
Everything is fine. It was just a dream.

46
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,355
You're up early.

47
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,355
Did you sleep well?

48
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,405
When I was little,

49
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:06,645
I used to get a gift from Santa every Christmas.

50
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,490
I knew it was my dad who dressed as Santa,

51
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:13,385
but I would get excited anyways.

52
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,765
Last night,

53
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:24,065
what you told me...

54
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,095
reminded me of the Christmas gift,

55
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,265
and I was very happy.

56
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:32,810
Who cares if you see someone else from this face?

57
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,745
I don't care if it's not my face.

58
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:37,475
I can't deny the fact that...

59
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,945
I want to open my gift right away.

60
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,915
But...

61
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,625
this gift is too precious...

62
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,795
which is why...

63
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,265
I want to be more careful...

64
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,465
for myself, and for you.

65
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,405
If you keep thinking of your wife from my face,

66
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:07,005
I can't get any closer to you.

67
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:12,575
I don't want to give you a hard time with this face.

68
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,815
But...

69
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,085
I'll wait.

70
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:22,385
I'll wait until you solely think of me...

71
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:25,225
from my face.

72
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:51,915
In Wook.

73
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,325
Father is waiting.

74
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,155
Do you know how many times...

75
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,895
I called your name?

76
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,700
Wasn't inheriting the company enough?

77
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,440
Do you want me to spoon-feed you now?

78
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:09,965
I apologize.

79
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,875
I have something urgent in the morning.

80
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,480
I must get going.

81
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,045
Sit down!

82
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,720
Son, please let your father...

83
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,690
finish breakfast in peace.

84
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,890
I think...

85
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,925
the time I gave you is over.

86
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,995
Considering the energy...

87
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,065
you need to empty and clean up your table at the office,

88
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,495
you need to eat well.

89
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,995
It was too vivid.

90
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:07,895
It was almost real.

91
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,985
I really must give you credit for your nerve, Dr. Seo.

92
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,655
What do you want...

93
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:15,900
this early in the morning?

94
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,865
I have something to ask,

95
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,340
and I must warn you about something as well.

96
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,070
Let me go first.

97
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,905
If you spread rumors about my marriage,

98
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:25,810
I will see you in court.

99
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,405
Are you saying that the picture I sent you was a fake?

100
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,950
Patients highly revere you, Dr. Seo.

101
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,590
The wife of a genius doctor...

102
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,985
who is praised by everyone across the country...

103
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:40,615
is having an affair with her husband's colleague.

104
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:44,255
It can't get any worse.

105
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,625
So...

106
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:52,100
bring me what I want before I make you look like a fool.

107
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,100
Kang In Wook.

108
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,170
I'm pointing my blade...

109
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,505
right at you...

110
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:01,045
from now on.

111
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,145
Bring my wife, Ma Ri,

112
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,245
or it will be the end of you.

113
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:11,655
Ending your life, Dr. Seo, is more than easy to me.

114
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,425
It's just a matter of time.

115
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:55,170
I'm pointing my blade...

116
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,325
right at you...

117
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,995
from now on.

118
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,415
- Good job. - Thank you.

119
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,615
Something smells like garbage in here.

120
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,830
Let's talk outside.

121
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,360
I have nothing to talk about with a piece of garbage like you.

122
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:30,225
- Get out. - You slapped me three times.

123
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,840
Slapping you three times isn't enough.

124
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:37,280
It will never be enough even if I resent you for the rest of my life.

125
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,775
Do you know that?

126
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,775
Then let me ask you one last thing.

127
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:48,115
How much does Kang In Wook know?

128
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:52,355
- What? - He handed the photo to Jung Won.

129
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,885
How did he even get the photo?

130
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,360
How much does he know about Ha Kyung and me?

131
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:01,430
Kang In Wook lives in a different world from us.

132
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,000
He's looking after Ha Kyung...

133
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,870
by using private investigators and detectives.

134
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,910
It's obvious that he already has your personal information.

135
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:12,135
- What is he doing this for? - Are you kidding?

136
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,245
He will never back down...

137
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,675
until Jung Won...

138
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,245
gives away Ma Ri.

139
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,560
Here is a summary of Seo Jung Won and Woo Ha Kyung's...

140
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,055
route analyzed by our detectives.

141
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,170
(Got on the 2000 bus. Got off the bus all of the sudden.)

142
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,695
This point.

143
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:44,305
Woo Ha Kyung took the bus and got off all of the sudden.

144
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,645
Did she know she was being followed?

145
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,735
These are the photos Kang In Wook sent to Jung Won.

146
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:17,205
The victim isn't Ha Seong Ho. It's Jung Won.

147
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:26,345
Do you have Woo Ha Kyung's wedding ring?

148
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:27,690
Yes, I do.

149
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,945
Please lend me her clothes and her ring again.

150
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,055
What for?

151
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,355
Let me borrow your phone.

152
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:50,470
- Yes. - Hello.

153
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:53,335
This is Woo Ha Kyung from Kyung Art Gallery.

154
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,950
Hello.

155
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:59,015
To what do I owe the pleasure of your call?

156
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:00,820
Let's meet up.

157
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,250
Sounds good. Let's meet up.

158
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,220
Let's meet up at my gallery at three in the afternoon.

159
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:07,115
No.

160
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,355
Let's meet up in my office.

161
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,525
I'll send you my secretary.

162
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,765
He'll bring you to my office.

163
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,090
Are you planning to meet up with Kang In Wook?

164
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,045
Just like what you said,

165
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:39,485
I'll try to completely hide myself using this face.

166
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,530
I'll paint as well.

167
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:45,560
Without publishing my real name.

168
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,000
Are you sure that will be okay?

169
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,695
You said you wanted to use him.

170
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,735
Leave it up to me.

171
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:57,335
I'll give you double the amount he's promised you.

172
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,480
But in return,

173
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,105
please don't disclose my identity for the time being.

174
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,375
When it's time,

175
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,085
I'll reveal it myself.

176
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:12,555
The moment you do,

177
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:17,285
he might kill you.

178
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,670
I know.

179
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,325
Tell me.

180
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:28,635
Is this because of Jung Won?

181
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,285
Dr. Seo.

182
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,585
We need to talk.

183
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,605
I won't ask for your forgiveness.

184
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,275
I know I don't deserve it.

185
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,845
But don't forgive Ha Kyung either.

186
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,075
Not only did she betray you,

187
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,015
but she betrayed me as well.

188
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,315
She said she loved me.

189
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,655
She said nothing would change even after she got married.

190
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:28,295
She said you'd believe her no matter what...

191
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,700
and that our relationship would be hidden forever.

192
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,495
Don't use her...

193
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,505
to make such a pitiful excuse.

194
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,735
It's not an excuse.

195
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:42,310
She knew everything.

196
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,475
She knew that even if we were caught,

197
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:47,715
you wouldn't be able to abandon her.

198
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,715
She knew I wouldn't be able to leave her either.

199
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,285
She had us in the palm of her hand.

200
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,785
She was haughty.

201
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,395
That's her true self.

202
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,895
So don't forgive her.

203
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:06,195
Right.

204
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,765
I shouldn't.

205
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,435
I shouldn't forgive both her...

206
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,515
and you.

207
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:23,085
I wanted to end it with her.

208
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,220
I wanted to forget her.

209
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,385
But it just wouldn't work.

210
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,555
I've drowned myself in alcohol and met other women too.

211
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,930
It wasn't easy for me either.

212
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,865
I couldn't bear it.

213
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:37,965
I've been ruining my life all this time.

214
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,505
All farewells leave traces behind.

215
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,315
Some farewells...

216
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,585
leave fragrant petals behind that can be used as bookmarks.

217
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,315
Others...

218
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:01,285
leave scars that cannot be healed.

219
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,945
My once fragrant memories have turned into scars.

220
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,845
I must erase them.

221
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,185
I must forget them.

222
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:40,225
In Wook.

223
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,400
You were right.

224
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,565
It's only a matter of time.

225
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,005
You're getting closer and closer to catching me.

226
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:02,120
I have nothing to hold onto anymore.

227
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,520
But...

228
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,855
there's something I must do beforehand.

229
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,655
I need more time...

230
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,925
for those whom I love.

231
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,965
Wait until then.

232
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,735
When the time is right,

233
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,565
I'll die in front of your eyes.

234
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,855
Aren't you Director Woo Ha Kyung of Kyung Art Gallery?

235
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,060
Director Woo Ha Kyung...

236
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,325
of Kyung Art Gallery?

237
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,125
I'm Kang Il Gook.

238
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,265
It's nice to meet you.

239
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,215
Chairman Kang is talking to Director Woo at the lobby.

240
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:48,525
I heard that my son, President Kang,

241
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:51,400
made an expansion...

242
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,860
in our company's business with you.

243
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm grateful that he has rated...

244
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,770
our gallery's competence quite highly.

245
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,800
"Competence"?

246
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,735
Your gallery is nothing but a small store.

247
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:07,775
I wonder what attracted my son to your gallery.

248
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,815
He said our gallery was prospective.

249
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,355
She's my guest.

250
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,695
I'll write up a report on our investment soon.

251
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,465
This way.

252
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,015
I'll look into this and let you know, sir.

253
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,200
You came here to confirm,

254
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:36,595
so why aren't you believing me?

255
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,665
If you can't believe me,

256
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:40,440
you can check the ob-gyn.

257
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,410
You'll know once you look at her medical records...

258
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,335
from five years ago.

259
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:49,105
(Hamer Ob-Gyn)

260
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,245
When she asked me to come with her to the ob-gyn,

261
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:56,450
I congratulated her.

262
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,015
But...

263
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:01,020
I later found out that it wasn't something to congratulate.

264
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:03,090
I tried to dissuade her,

265
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:05,855
but she wouldn't listen to me.

266
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:09,365
She knew...

267
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,235
that I wouldn't be able...

268
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,765
to say anything to you.

269
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:17,835
Ha Kyung used...

270
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:20,405
the feelings I had for you.

271
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,345
She did so every time.

272
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,615
Thank you for telling me.

273
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:34,285
What will you do with Yoon Ma Ri?

274
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,725
Why did you bring her back in?

275
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,155
I am going...

276
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,725
to start all over...

277
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,765
with her.

278
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,680
What?

279
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,175
That's why I came here.

280
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:56,475
I'm planning...

281
00:23:57,553 --> 00:23:59,745
to let go of Ha Kyung.

282
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,945
That way,

283
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,615
I can look at Ma Ri in the eye.

284
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:08,955
Do you think In Wook will just sit still and watch?

285
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:11,585
Do you know what he said to me?

286
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:15,825
I asked what he'd do if his wife was seeing someone else.

287
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:17,825
He said he'd kill him.

288
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,095
He'd kill them both.

289
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,305
He will end up...

290
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,280
killing both of you.

291
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:27,880
Are you okay with that?

292
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,505
I am.

293
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,015
Because I'll protect her.

294
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,325
They're both insane.

295
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,505
All right.

296
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:59,640
Why did you want to see me?

297
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,275
On that day,

298
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:04,345
I didn't tell the cops anything...

299
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:07,275
because I wanted you to keep your dignity.

300
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:14,185
So...

301
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,595
what is this dirty trick you're pulling?

302
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,665
It's all water under the bridge.

303
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:25,265
And it was my mistake.

304
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:28,665
My husband has suffered enough.

305
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:32,540
You need to leave him alone.

306
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:35,645
Then you should've given me what I wanted.

307
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:37,850
Why did you allow things to come this far?

308
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:41,020
If it's regarding your wife, I said I didn't know.

309
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,585
You don't?

310
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:45,360
Is that true?

311
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,315
I wonder...

312
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:50,125
if it was truly because of me that you didn't make a scene...

313
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:52,130
by calling the cops.

314
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,565
Perhaps, you have a secret that needs to stay hidden.

315
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:13,375
If you're looking for the artist who painted the Cistus flowers,

316
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,115
I'll help you.

317
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,385
But in return,

318
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:20,455
promise me two things.

319
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:24,085
First, stop tormenting...

320
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,755
my husband.

321
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,095
And second,

322
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:35,610
only discuss with me the things related...

323
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:37,265
to that artist.

324
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,505
Leave out my husband and Vice-Director Joo Hae Ra.

325
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,505
Just talk with me.

326
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,190
You seem confident.

327
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,620
My honor,

328
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:55,655
my family's peace,

329
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:58,695
and the gallery's success are in your hands.

330
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,925
So I'll do my best...

331
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,925
to find that artist.

332
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:07,665
I'm fine...

333
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,165
as long as you don't take too long...

334
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,705
to find my wife.

335
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,575
All right, then.

336
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,545
I'll trust that you'll keep your word.

337
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:45,335
What are you doing?

338
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,425
And...

339
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,455
third,

340
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,155
don't you ever...

341
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:10,595
come near me again.

342
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,525
Director Woo.

343
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:39,325
I'll drive you home.

344
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:43,100
It's all right. I can go alone.

345
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:46,365
- The president ordered that... - I'll go alone.

346
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:09,285
Stop imagining absurd things.

347
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:12,995
Snap out of it.

348
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:15,925
You must.

349
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,705
(Episode 26)

350
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,450
You just need to heat the stew.

351
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,575
Don't skip your meals.

352
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:08,945
I'll be painting at my workroom for the time being.

353
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:27,295
Hello?

354
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,535
I'll come pick you up once you're done painting.

355
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:35,705
I'll just sleep here once I'm done.

356
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:40,515
Okay.

357
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:43,815
Make sure you eat.

358
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,385
I will.

359
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,835
I don't want to give you a hard time with this face.

360
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,995
I'll wait.

361
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:05,265
I'll wait until you solely think of me...

362
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,205
from my face.

363
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:36,125
It's me.

364
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,205
Is this place a nice spot to read during the weekends?

365
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:53,075
Don't mind me, and keep painting.

366
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,075
I'll just read.

367
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,815
The moments when I want time to stop.

368
00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:29,650
The moments I want...

369
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:32,485
to put into a time capsule and store in a treasure chest.

370
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,960
The moments I want to keep safe...

371
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:38,185
from all destruction.

372
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,830
The moments that I wish would last forever.

373
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:43,825
What are they?

374
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:48,765
Those valuable moments that I'd like to cherish forever...

375
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:51,265
are very ordinary moments.

376
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:55,235
They're moments that are...

377
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:58,945
so ordinary that you're not even aware of how happy you are.

378
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:02,315
Ma Ri.

379
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,155
What is this?

380
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:13,095
I heard painters tend to have dry skin.

381
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,465
Thank you.

382
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:28,205
Just in case you get paint in your hair.

383
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:38,955
Excuse me for a minute.

384
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,055
Yes?

385
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:51,465
Sorry? So what happened?

386
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,605
Okay, I'll go there right now.

387
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,580
- What is it? - My mom's gone missing.

388
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,605
I need to find her.

389
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,745
Calm down.

390
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,915
I'm sure she's fine.

391
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,415
Hold on.

392
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:32,005
Get closer.

393
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,420
Okay, I did it.

394
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:46,255
What's that car in front of us? Get closer.

395
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,765
All right.

396
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,765
You're quite good.

397
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,600
Hey! Watch how you drive!

398
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,770
I'm so sorry.

399
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,295
As you can see, I'm a rookie driver.

400
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:36,535
"You'll be blessed for your patience."

401
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,525
Ma Ri, what should we do?

402
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:01,900
Tell me what happened.

403
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:04,770
Your mom, her caregiver, and I were taking a walk.

404
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,970
But in a blink of an eye,

405
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,465
she disappeared.

406
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:14,035
They told me to wait here, in case she returned.

407
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,045
Give me the caregiver's number.

408
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:27,215
We can find her. We'll split up.

409
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:30,155
Hello, ma'am. Where are you?

410
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:33,125
Mom!

411
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,095
Mom!

412
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:38,995
Ma'am!

413
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:41,095
Ma'am!

414
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:46,735
Ma'am!

415
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,390
Ma'am.

416
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:04,360
Why are you here?

417
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,825
I'm waiting for my husband.

418
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:11,195
I was told to wait here.

419
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,395
But he's not here.

420
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,940
Your husband said that it's cold out...

421
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:19,835
and wants you to wait indoors.

422
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:27,345
Let's go inside.

423
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,545
Mom!

424
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,315
Mom! Mom!

425
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,685
Are you okay?

426
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:38,800
Why are you out here when you're not even well?

427
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,195
I've been looking everywhere for you.

428
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:44,525
I told you not to go alone.

429
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,665
I was waiting for my husband.

430
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:54,535
He said he'd come.

431
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:59,775
It's all right. You're okay.

432
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,820
My husband said he'd come.

433
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:07,920
Outside the village

434
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,055
On the fruit garden way

435
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,225
Acacia flowers have bloomed

436
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:20,400
Snow-white

437
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:23,710
Flower leaves

438
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:28,675
Like snowflakes, they fly away

439
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:11,015
It's okay.

440
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,295
Can we go out for a minute?

441
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:21,925
Okay.

442
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,825
You gave me a lot of alone time,

443
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,925
so I've been pondering.

444
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:03,865
When you're having a fever,

445
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:07,005
in order to know how high your fever is,

446
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:09,375
it's best to check...

447
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,405
by putting your foreheads together.

448
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:34,795
Like this.

449
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:49,445
A hand for a hand.

450
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,585
A forehead for a forehead.

451
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,825
And if you want to confirm that person's feelings,

452
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,355
you have to look with the eyes of your heart.

453
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,065
But...

454
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,565
I only looked at you with my eyes.

455
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,065
I'm sorry about that.

456
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:16,475
I've been repenting a lot.

457
00:42:17,385 --> 00:42:20,075
Now, I can see you clearly.

458
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:22,845
Even in this darkness,

459
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:28,585
I can see you very well.

460
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:25,245
It's odd.

461
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:28,475
The closer I get to completing the puzzle,

462
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,520
the stranger the picture looks.

463
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,215
My instincts...

464
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:36,390
keep warning me.

465
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:38,185
Whenever I see Jung Won,

466
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,455
I feel like...

467
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,265
I have lost...

468
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:46,635
my wife...

469
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:49,535
- to him. - I'll bring out some tea.

470
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,115
You said you were drinking alone.

471
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,355
I guess you drank one too many.

472
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:14,425
Aren't you being too emotional?

473
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:17,125
Emotions are easier...

474
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:20,895
to see than reason.

475
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,805
Then...

476
00:44:26,313 --> 00:44:28,405
look at this through your emotions.

477
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:31,975
Why are you looking so desperately...

478
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:33,715
for your wife who has run away?

479
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,745
You know what?

480
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:40,515
I held my breath when I saw her for the first time.

481
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:43,055
I thought...

482
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,055
my mom had come back to life.

483
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:49,625
You're such a fool.

484
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,095
Your wife and your mother are separate individuals.

485
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,935
Aren't we both fools?

486
00:44:58,713 --> 00:45:01,275
This is Jung Won's favorite music.

487
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:05,575
And that is Jung Won's favorite cup.

488
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:12,145
Why are you living like this?

489
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:21,895
You know everything, don't you?

490
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:24,565
Why don't you stop prying into other people's lives...

491
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,040
and focus on healing your broken heart?

492
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,795
Exactly!

493
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,210
So hand her over.

494
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:33,075
She's the only one who can heal me!

495
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:36,510
I know already.

496
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:39,980
A poison is spreading inside of me,

497
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,180
so I need an antidote.

498
00:45:42,189 --> 00:45:47,455
That is exactly why I'm looking for my wife, Yoon Ma Ri!

499
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:57,165
How dare you...

500
00:45:58,105 --> 00:45:59,795
toy with me...

501
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:03,965
by giving me one puzzle piece...

502
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:06,335
at a time?

503
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:09,205
I gave you money.

504
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,080
But Woo Ha Kyung came,

505
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:13,950
telling me that she'd find the artist of the Cistus painting.

506
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:15,745
Something's fishy.

507
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:18,785
If...

508
00:46:18,893 --> 00:46:20,515
you...

509
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:22,115
and Ha Kyung...

510
00:46:22,163 --> 00:46:25,555
deceive me and hand me a fake antidote,

511
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:29,995
you'll die first.

512
00:46:45,686 --> 00:46:47,120
Hurry up.

513
00:46:47,121 --> 00:46:50,645
While tracing Woo Ha Kyung's course, I've found something interesting.

514
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,590
These in red are all secret, private sanitariums.

515
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:58,385
And this is the route for the bus she was in.

516
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:01,025
And at the end of this route,

517
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:02,695
there is...

518
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:04,865
a secret sanitarium.

519
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:07,465
It's right here.

520
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:25,385
Mom.

521
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:29,285
I'm sorry that I keep asking you to wait.

522
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:32,525
But...

523
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,925
this is the last time.

524
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:36,965
Okay?

525
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,265
I'm really sorry.

526
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:09,765
I'll visit you again.

527
00:48:11,906 --> 00:48:15,040
Don't go. Don't go.

528
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:17,140
Don't go.

529
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,570
Please don't go.

530
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:20,380
- I'll be back, mom. - Don't go.

531
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:22,375
Don't go.

532
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,080
- Don't go. - Ma'am, we'll be back soon.

533
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:27,950
Why are you leaving?

534
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:30,015
Please don't.

535
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:10,855
Let's move her to another place soon.

536
00:49:12,499 --> 00:49:15,425
There are many flowers there, and you can even see the ocean.

537
00:49:15,803 --> 00:49:17,825
I'm sure she'll like it.

538
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:22,095
If fate allows,

539
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,565
I'd like to start with this person...

540
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:32,845
a kind of love...

541
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:35,645
that will never...

542
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:39,315
fail.

543
00:49:42,162 --> 00:49:46,355
If Fate Allows, I'd Like to Love Once Again.
