1
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,245
Ever since I saw her soul,

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,285
her soul has permeated my heart,

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,615
and it gives me a sharp stab of pain.

4
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:25,825
I don't even know why it pierces my heart.

5
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:33,265
(Episode 15: Your Love Stays In My Heart)

6
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:36,335
But there's one thing I know for sure.

7
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:40,205
I want to protect her.

8
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,380
Ms. Kim, I'm on my way there now.

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,195
Please get things ready so I can start the operation immediately.

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,575
So...

11
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,060
a patient who's been lying here for five years...

12
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,045
got up all of a sudden...

13
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,445
and went home in Seoul?

14
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,985
Is that what you're saying?

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,715
Yes. That's true.

16
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:29,725
Ms. Kim, give me that file.

17
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,785
Let me ask you one more thing.

18
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,325
You remember the date, right?

19
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,110
- Pardon? - The day...

20
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,295
Woo Ha Kyung went back to Seoul.

21
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:12,795
A miraculous thing happened that day.

22
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,465
You must remember the happy day.

23
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,005
The day Ma Ri went missing,

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,215
Woo Ha Kyung went back to Seoul.

25
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,860
The place Woo Ha Kyung's way back to Seoul...

26
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:31,015
and the one Ma Ri took when she ran away intersect...

27
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,825
That's right.

28
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,195
That's the place.

29
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,435
Ma Ri.

30
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,405
We will be meeting soon.

31
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,645
Postpone the meeting for 5pm to 7pm.

32
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,685
I'm going to meet Director Woo Ha Kyung now.

33
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,705
What is he up to? We're almost out of time.

34
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,520
He has never been late for an operation before.

35
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,120
He'll be on time.

36
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,575
You should trust him and wait.

37
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:33,960
Is everything ready?

38
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,515
- Yes, sir. - Yes, Doctor.

39
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,615
Wow, it's beautiful.

40
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,925
It smells like flowers.

41
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,335
How much do you want?

42
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:52,480
You take care of it.

43
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,905
Okay.

44
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,350
Just trust me.

45
00:03:57,354 --> 00:04:00,705
You can just wait here. I'll go sell this painting now.

46
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:04,220
Wish me luck. We can do this.

47
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,775
Good luck.

48
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,045
It should sell well.

49
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,185
Irrigation.

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,305
The meeting is postponed to 7pm.

51
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:39,160
Hello, Ms. Park.

52
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:41,845
We believe you.

53
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,085
Yes.

54
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,755
I'll call you back.

55
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,565
What brings you here all of a sudden?

56
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,095
Director Woo Ha Kyung.

57
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,165
Call her right now.

58
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,935
We talked about this.

59
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:08,190
She doesn't come to the gallery because she's busy with her work.

60
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:11,575
I heard she was unconscious for five years.

61
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,885
Is it okay for her to work so hard already?

62
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,725
How did you know that?

63
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,795
I went to the place she was nursed at.

64
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,595
And I met Doctor Seo Jung Won there.

65
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,010
I don't know why, but every time I go to...

66
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:35,905
meet Woo Ha Kyung, Doctor Seo Jung Won is there.

67
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,445
Where's Woo Ha Kyung's studio?

68
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,055
I'll go there myself.

69
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,155
Ma Ri!

70
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,725
Hey.

71
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,535
Do you know...

72
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:09,465
how much I asked for your painting?

73
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,735
1,000 dollars.

74
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,590
- That much? - Yes.

75
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:15,850
Isn't it too much?

76
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,620
We can totally do that.

77
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,420
We put your first painting up at auction,

78
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,645
and it sold only in a few days.

79
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:23,115
And...

80
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,285
this is the money from your first painting.

81
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,355
It's 500 dollars.

82
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,470
Are you sure it was sold?

83
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,695
It was sold only in a week.

84
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:37,835
What do you think? Aren't I good?

85
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,265
Aren't I a reliable agent?

86
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:46,550
Thank you, Woo Seon.

87
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:50,190
Just focus on your work from now on.

88
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:54,345
I'll make sure to sell your paintings, okay?

89
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,715
What would I have done without you?

90
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:04,525
I felt completely lost.

91
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:11,195
Why is it so hard...

92
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,695
to tell me where her studio is?

93
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,265
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:18,250
She doesn't want to meet anyone while she works.

95
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,005
I'm telling you again.

96
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,105
Director Woo Ha Kyung will...

97
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:25,015
need to sign the contract herself.

98
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,845
Otherwise,

99
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,885
we will sign a partnership...

100
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,685
with another gallery.

101
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,200
I asked you to give us some time.

102
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,795
I told you. I'm not good at waiting.

103
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,465
You better make...

104
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,725
a wise choice.

105
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,585
Doctor Seo.

106
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,230
What do we do?

107
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,730
He kept asking me with insistence,

108
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,885
so I ended up telling him the date of Ha Kyung's funeral.

109
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,530
I said she went back to Seoul that day.

110
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,895
Okay.

111
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,925
If he comes again, give me a call.

112
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,595
Please.

113
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,025
What are you doing here?

114
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:54,435
Now that you're saving your breath,

115
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:57,435
I'm on the move doing things.

116
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,530
I said I wouldn't tolerate you coming here again.

117
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:50,955
Cut it out.

118
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,295
Where's my wife?

119
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,365
So you've been looking for your wife.

120
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,980
But why are you looking for your wife here?

121
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:03,565
Director Woo Ha Kyung...

122
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,875
went back home after a very long recovery.

123
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,150
So?

124
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,175
You wouldn't forget it then.

125
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:16,745
The day your wife left her treatment after five years.

126
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,255
You had a patient in your car.

127
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:23,955
It was a dark rainy night, so you couldn't drive fast.

128
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:28,770
What are you trying to say?

129
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,265
That day,

130
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:34,805
my wife went missing.

131
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:45,975
Don't you remember?

132
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,185
On that rainy night,

133
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,085
a woman ran into the roadway.

134
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,725
Unfortunately,

135
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:38,535
I don't know anything about your wife's whereabouts.

136
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,350
I'm sorry about your wife,

137
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,175
but you can't threaten my family without any evidence.

138
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,675
Please stop it.

139
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:49,645
This is my last warning.

140
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,445
Doctor Seo.

141
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,215
Listen to me, Doctor Seo.

142
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,870
If it's you and your wife...

143
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,985
who took my wife that night,

144
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,625
you will have to be ready to lose everything.

145
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:10,835
I'm serious.

146
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:14,865
I'll make it happen.

147
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,545
Is there anything else you can do other than threats?

148
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,715
I don't believe those who threaten others, Mr. Kang In Wook.

149
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,465
I think you should know.

150
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:55,175
I know.

151
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:58,590
Kang In Wook went to your mom's place.

152
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:01,860
And you went all the way there right before an operation.

153
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,600
Don't face him alone ever again.

154
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,915
That's the last thing I want to do.

155
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:10,425
He just barged in and threatened me.

156
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,100
If he doesn't meet Director Woo Ha Kyung,

157
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,270
he will break up the partnership.

158
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,140
What do I do?

159
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,265
We have to come up with something.

160
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,035
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

161
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:26,875
It's just once.

162
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,620
If Ma Ri meets him as Ha Kyung once,

163
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,675
it will clear up all his doubts.

164
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:46,395
I was going to call you.

165
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,965
Yes. Right.

166
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,895
Okay. I'll see you there.

167
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,935
Was that Yoon Ma Ri?

168
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:04,515
If you meet her, tell her to be Ha Kyung.

169
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,675
I mean, she has to be Ha Kyung.

170
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,845
- What do you want to eat? - What would you like to eat?

171
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:41,230
The dinner is on me tonight.

172
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,985
I made some money.

173
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:47,670
(Research Data of Kyung Art Gallery)

174
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,785
(Report of Tax Investigation)

175
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,365
(Cash-in-hand, Savings, Instalment savings, Pension...)

176
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:02,050
The financial situation of the gallery is quite bad.

177
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:05,475
It seems Doctor Seo has used his own money to run the gallery.

178
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,405
Last year,

179
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,520
- they even lost a whole building. - Right.

180
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,390
It's been operating at a loss for the past five years,

181
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,185
but Director Woo Ha Kyung is making excessive investments.

182
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:19,315
It's so bad that they'd take the bait knowing what it is.

183
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,555
Come in.

184
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:31,010
As you instructed, I met Seo Jung Won's neighbours.

185
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,135
And no one saw his wife in the neighbourhood.

186
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:39,705
- Keep looking into it. - Yes, sir.

187
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,445
By the way, there's one strange thing.

188
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't think Woo Ha Kyung lives there.

189
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,260
What?

190
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:55,855
All the neighbours think that he lives alone in the house.

191
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,665
Keep an eye...

192
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:05,735
on his house 24 hours a day.

193
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,485
It looks so delicious.

194
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,885
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

195
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:34,070
I wanted to buy something better than this.

196
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,165
This is good enough. Let's eat.

197
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,375
So what did you do?

198
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,575
You said you made money. How much did you make?

199
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:57,145
It's not a lot, but I sold my painting for the first time.

200
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm so excited that my painting sold.

201
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,300
I heard you majored in art,

202
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,725
but I didn't know you still paint.

203
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,955
This calls for a celebration.

204
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:16,035
She's finally got her own life back.

205
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,475
- Is it good? - Yes.

206
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,020
- Here. - Let me do that.

207
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,090
It's okay. I'll do it.

208
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,615
She finally...

209
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,755
gets to enjoy pleasant moments.

210
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,045
- By the way... - Well...

211
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:32,845
You go first.

212
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,285
Well... Here.

213
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:45,070
With the money I made for the first time,

214
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:48,325
I wanted to buy something for my mom and you.

215
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:54,535
You bought me dinner...

216
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,950
and got me a gift.

217
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,035
I'm not earning much yet,

218
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,005
but I'll buy you something better next time.

219
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,425
Gosh, it's so warm.

220
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:58,065
What were you trying to say?

221
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:00,935
Let's just...

222
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,465
stay happy like this tonight.

223
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,435
With no worries.

224
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:08,975
With a smile.

225
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,475
I forgot.

226
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,785
I'll tell you next time. Go home.

227
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,660
Okay. Go home safely.

228
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,455
Hey, that's her. She's the one I was talking about.

229
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:25,395
She lives here alone. Amazing right?

230
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,895
Hey, stay quiet.

231
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:31,895
Quiet. Hey.

232
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,865
Do you know him?

233
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,505
He lives downstairs.

234
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,385
Let's go.

235
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,185
What?

236
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,870
Hey, she's coming.

237
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,440
Just wait.

238
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,070
- Let me see. - Wait.

239
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:01,870
Just wait. I'll show you.

240
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:03,625
Wait.

241
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,505
I thought she lives alone.

242
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,115
That's strange.

243
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:32,125
Wait here. I'll be right back.

244
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,275
Keep them on here.

245
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,375
To show that you have someone in and out at your place.

246
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,545
I'll get going then.

247
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:28,985
Good night.

248
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:34,925
Wait.

249
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:47,365
I only have instant coffee,

250
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,735
but would you like some?

251
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,555
Please come in.

252
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,975
Do I have any fruits?

253
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:28,275
Of course not.

254
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,295
Here.

255
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:27,495
They are beautiful.

256
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,905
Did you paint all of them?

257
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,905
Yes.

258
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,375
They are flowers.

259
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:40,115
It looks like they have feelings.

260
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,285
They are weak but tough.

261
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,545
They are sad but shining.

262
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:48,355
Is it something like Frida Kahlo's saying?

263
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:52,325
"I paint flowers so they will not die."

264
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,535
Because...

265
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:02,565
I don't want to die.

266
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:07,675
The bruises...

267
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:11,175
on my body...

268
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,075
looked like flowers.

269
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:19,115
They are yellow, red, and blue.

270
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,385
Sometimes they are purple and maroon.

271
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,570
Having thoughts like that,

272
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,495
I painted flowers.

273
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,595
Hoping someone will see them.

274
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:39,420
Hoping someone will...

275
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:42,075
recognize my signal for help.

276
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,815
Flowers were...

277
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,215
my signal for help to the world.

278
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,930
But my husband...

279
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:56,785
never gave me a chance to show them to others.

280
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,255
So no one...

281
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,925
could receive the signal.

282
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:10,365
I'm really happy now.

283
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,620
I can paint flowers whenever I want,

284
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:15,005
and I can show them to others.

285
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:18,090
I can live on the money I made...

286
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,215
from my paintings.

287
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,615
This is the happiest moment of my life.

288
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:28,215
And I owe it all to you.

289
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,585
Thank you so much...

290
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,525
for giving me such precious time.

291
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:42,165
Actually,

292
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:45,635
I submitted my painting to Kyung Art Gallery.

293
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:49,075
My gallery?

294
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,860
My wife used to run the gallery.

295
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,645
Hae Ra has been running it since my wife died.

296
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:02,655
I just thought it was in the same building.

297
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:04,725
What was your painting?

298
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,225
Is it perhaps...

299
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:14,065
the painting of the Cistus?

300
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:17,135
Did you see the painting?

301
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,605
It's mine.

302
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:22,105
That's my own portrait.

303
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:28,645
It was you?

304
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,485
I've been looking for you.

305
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:37,325
I can't believe this.

306
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:40,195
I'm the one...

307
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,525
who picked your painting for the rookie award.

308
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:45,710
What?

309
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:47,280
It was you?

310
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,805
Yes, it was me.

311
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:56,745
I'm glad I found the painter of that Cistus painting.

312
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,520
I've been looking for you thinking you'd save the gallery.

313
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:02,585
You must treasure your art gallery.

314
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,345
It's precious to me.

315
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,485
The gallery...

316
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,555
and your painting.

317
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,395
I'm sure there's something.

318
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,405
The gallery...

319
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,365
and...

320
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,135
the couple who was driving on the road that night.

321
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:04,445
And Ma Ri.

322
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,715
Among them.

323
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,785
Cistus means...

324
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,585
"I'm dying tomorrow."

325
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:19,725
So the title is "A Self-Portrait".

326
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:21,925
That's...

327
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,825
how I felt every day.

328
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,965
I painted...

329
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,565
my bruised body and wounded soul...

330
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,205
back then.

331
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:41,885
Ma Ri.

332
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:46,285
I said...

333
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,770
hide-and-seek isn't fun.

334
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:19,555
(Episode 16)

335
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:45,275
(President Kang In Wook)

336
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:52,415
Seo Jung Won entered his home alone just now.

337
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:06,095
You were the first person who noticed...

338
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,365
my signal for help.

339
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:23,345
So that your self-portrait isn't in any more pain...

340
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,015
So that a happy flower...

341
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,055
blooms in your painting instead of a sad one.

342
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:31,555
I will...

343
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,625
protect you.

344
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,550
What? Whom did you find?

345
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:49,105
The genius rookie who we desperately looked for.

346
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,645
The genius rookie?

347
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,685
("A Self-Portrait")

348
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:03,085
I found the artist who we really wanted to find.

349
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,225
You did?

350
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,425
How? Who is it?

351
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:11,295
It's Yoon Ma Ri.

352
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:16,010
- What? - Yoon Ma Ri.

353
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,135
Are you surprised? I'm surprised too.

354
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:24,175
No.

355
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:26,890
It can't be her.

356
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,460
It's unbelievable for me too.

357
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:32,085
We looked so much for her, but she was actually right next to us.

358
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:36,655
How...

359
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:38,500
did you find out?

360
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,900
Are you sure about it?

361
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:42,640
How can this be? Why didn't she tell us all along?

362
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:45,595
Ask one question at a time, will you?

363
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:47,270
She has more paintings?

364
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,870
And they're very good.

365
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:51,195
Enough to be our gallery's star artist.

366
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:54,435
Does this mean...

367
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,035
President Kang knows...

368
00:33:57,385 --> 00:34:00,505
who drew that Cistus painting?

369
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:04,720
That is why he suspected us.

370
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:07,545
Because her painting was in our gallery.

371
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,245
Did you ask Ma Ri...

372
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:13,660
- to be Ha Kyung? - I already said no to that.

373
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:15,485
Don't mention it again.

374
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:27,910
How about we take some time in exhibiting her paintings?

375
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,335
What if...

376
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:32,050
President Kang notices them?

377
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,705
I'm working on a way...

378
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:35,520
to set her free completely.

379
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:37,120
Jung Won.

380
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,890
This is enough already.

381
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,390
That isn't what's urgent.

382
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:44,385
We must save the gallery first to exhibit and foster artists.

383
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,615
Let's keep our gallery small.

384
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,625
There's nothing to worry as long as we don't get greedy.

385
00:34:53,274 --> 00:34:55,895
Don't you know who we're up against?

386
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,165
Don't worry.

387
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,235
I'll come up with a way to get through this.

388
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:05,475
Just focus on running the gallery.

389
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,245
Hey.

390
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,655
("A Self-Portrait")

391
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:32,865
Isn't it warm?

392
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:36,735
Yes, thank you.

393
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,250
From now on,

394
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:41,675
I'll buy you a lot of delicious food and pretty stuff.

395
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:44,645
I can make lots of money now.

396
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,845
Wait...

397
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:55,315
just a little more time, Mom.

398
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:03,495
I'll have you stay in a place more comfortable.

399
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,435
Why didn't you come with him?

400
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:08,140
What?

401
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,605
Why didn't you come with him?

402
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:13,175
You said you'd bring him.

403
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:18,645
Did you...

404
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,215
wait for Doctor Seo?

405
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:22,730
He wanted...

406
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,085
to come see you with me,

407
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,315
but you know, he's busy.

408
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,855
So I didn't tell him and came alone.

409
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,125
He's a kind man.

410
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,095
A kind man.

411
00:36:36,744 --> 00:36:38,165
Right.

412
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:44,105
He really is so kind.

413
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:51,205
He promised he'd visit me again.

414
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:02,825
Yes.

415
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,025
Seo Jung Won is always alone.

416
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,325
And Woo Ha Kyung never leaves the house.

417
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:49,305
It's strange.

418
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,405
It's very strange.

419
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,120
Remind Mr. Park of the exhibition schedule.

420
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:57,990
See how much he's done with his paintings.

421
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:00,045
Well...

422
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,760
We got a call from him,

423
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:06,055
and he wants to reconsider the exhibition.

424
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,600
What?

425
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:10,770
Rumours seem to be saying...

426
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:13,995
it's dangerous to work with our gallery.

427
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,595
And he's worried because of it.

428
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,135
(President Kang In Wook)

429
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,350
Hello, President Kang.

430
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,975
I'll visit your gallery at 3pm tomorrow.

431
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,690
Excuse me?

432
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:34,775
You better have Director Woo in the office tomorrow.

433
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:41,955
Hello? Sir.

434
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,945
Hello, Ms. Yoon. This is Joo Hae Ra.

435
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:29,095
I can't believe she's the one who painted that Cistus.

436
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:32,265
She has the face of Ha Kyung...

437
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,235
and is way more talented than her.

438
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:56,955
I ordered the tea for you.

439
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,865
Why did you want to see me?

440
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,355
Is Ms. Woo Ha Kyung in the house?

441
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,625
Why are you looking for my wife?

442
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:34,540
I need to check...

443
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,065
if the woman in the house is really your wife.

444
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:38,510
Why?

445
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,265
Is there any problem with it?

446
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:43,680
If you don't show her right now...

447
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:45,065
Honey.

448
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:50,975
Can I talk to you for a second?

449
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,515
Sorry. We're running out of time.

450
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:08,195
They're a married couple?

451
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,165
I want to tell you...

452
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:49,635
a better way...

453
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:51,505
for you...

454
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:54,205
to hide.

455
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,345
A way...

456
00:42:57,592 --> 00:42:59,545
to hide for good.

457
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,325
President Kang is oppressing the gallery.

458
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:13,425
I think he believes Ha Kyung is protecting you.

459
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,240
He even went to Jung Won's mother's house...

460
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:18,965
to do a background check on her,

461
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,095
looking for clues to you.

462
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:28,120
I had no idea.

463
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:29,675
I'm pretty sure...

464
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:32,145
Doctor Seo couldn't tell you.

465
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:33,845
That's how he is.

466
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:37,315
He keeps his mouth shut in case he might hurt others.

467
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,725
To be honest,

468
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,695
I'm upset.

469
00:43:48,743 --> 00:43:52,465
Your sudden appearance put us into a mess.

470
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:57,105
- I'm sorry. - Are you even sorry?

471
00:43:59,654 --> 00:44:02,575
Of course, I am.

472
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:08,815
Then...

473
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:13,155
do me a favour.

474
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,855
Like I told you earlier,

475
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:20,725
it's also a way for you...

476
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:23,395
to hide for good.

477
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,395
What...

478
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,405
do you want me to do?

479
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,775
Be Director Woo Ha Kyung.

480
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:41,060
What?

481
00:44:41,062 --> 00:44:42,915
Meet President Kang...

482
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,085
as Ha Kyung.

483
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:11,705
Kang In Wook has us in his trap.

484
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:13,945
We know that it's a trap,

485
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,215
but if we want to end this, we have to enter his trap.

486
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,810
I don't think that's my decision to make.

487
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,835
What if there's no other way?

488
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:37,480
That's the only way...

489
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,705
to keep the gallery going.

490
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:43,520
Doctor Seo invested all his money in the gallery.

491
00:45:43,524 --> 00:45:46,745
Besides, he's almost like a charity doctor.

492
00:45:48,863 --> 00:45:51,385
In order to get the sponsorship from President Kang,

493
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,485
the director must sign the contract herself.

494
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:58,125
I'm so frustrated because I can't do it even if I want to.

495
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:00,925
Doctor Seo...

496
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:03,595
also wishes to save the gallery,

497
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:07,465
but he's feeling too bad to ask you for this.

498
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,275
You said...

499
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,035
you're apologetic and grateful to him.

500
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:19,050
You just have to...

501
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:21,615
play Woo Ha Kyung without letting him know...

502
00:46:21,662 --> 00:46:23,815
and sign the contract.

503
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:26,855
That's the best shot we've got.

504
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:48,075
(Call history, Contact list)

505
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,365
Hello, Mother.

506
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:15,140
How did the seminar go?

507
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:16,380
It went well.

508
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,565
And I came back safely.

509
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,675
Is everything all right?

510
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:23,990
I heard a detective visited to inquire about Ha Kyung...

511
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:26,715
and things seemed serious.

512
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:30,015
What is going on?

513
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,855
There's something...

514
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:38,425
I haven't gotten to tell you.

515
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,025
What is it about?

516
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:47,210
If you invest 2,000 dollars, it'll only be a matter of time...

517
00:47:47,214 --> 00:47:49,280
for it to become 20,000 then 30,000 dollars.

518
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,350
Trust me...

519
00:47:51,352 --> 00:47:54,350
and invest in your future.

520
00:47:54,355 --> 00:47:57,975
I need your support. Bottoms up.

521
00:47:58,092 --> 00:47:59,560
Someone's calling you.

522
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,915
Oh, okay.

523
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,830
Hey.

524
00:48:03,831 --> 00:48:06,330
Don't even mention about Kyung Art Gallery.

525
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,860
I do feel bad about your rookie award,

526
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:10,655
but that place is about to shut down.

527
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,525
Rumours are rampant...

528
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,395
that they're in a serious financial deficit.

529
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,410
- A financial deficit? - Yes.

530
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:22,580
It seems like the contest was their final attempt...

531
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,135
which didn't work out so well.

532
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:27,305
You were the only one they got, but you didn't sign the contract.

533
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,575
Too bad for them, but your survival should come first.

534
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,145
Mark my words.

535
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,685
Don't even think about working with them.

536
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:39,345
Okay.

537
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,055
Thanks.

538
00:48:46,874 --> 00:48:49,595
I'm glad I found the painter of that Cistus painting.

539
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,210
I've been looking for you thinking you'd save the gallery.

540
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:55,195
You must treasure your art gallery.

541
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:57,135
It's precious to me.

542
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,305
The gallery...

543
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,305
and your painting.

544
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:37,245
He's a kind man.

545
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:39,305
A kind man.

546
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:45,185
There must be something you can do for him.

547
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,140
Hi, Ma Ri.

548
00:50:28,142 --> 00:50:30,595
Hello. I want to give it a go.

549
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:33,765
Really?

550
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,680
Good thinking.

551
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:38,035
I know...

552
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:41,005
he won't be fooled by a clumsy act.

553
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:43,075
I want to prepare for it thoroughly.

554
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,445
Send me the information about Ms. Woo.

555
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:49,060
Okay, I'll send you the information about the gallery...

556
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:51,160
and on recent trends in the art field.

557
00:50:51,165 --> 00:50:54,400
And also I'll send you a list of paintings...

558
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:55,700
that Gunha Group will be interested in.

559
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:58,585
I just need the information about the gallery and Ms. Woo.

560
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:01,025
I already know the trends in the art field,

561
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,695
and about his liking,

562
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,895
I'm well aware of it.

563
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,335
You must be.

564
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,635
Okay then.

565
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:26,685
The deity of winds was jealous...

566
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:30,625
over Apollo, the deity of sun, and Hyacinth, the prince he loved.

567
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:34,025
He sent winds to kill the prince.

568
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:43,905
A Hyacinth flower bloomed where he died.

569
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,175
Why do flowers...

570
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:51,345
always bloom on places with tears and shadows?

571
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,760
Your Love Stays in My Heart.

572
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:58,585
(Your Love Stays in My Heart)

573
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,635
(Love in Sadness)

574
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:17,680
You're here early.

575
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:19,050
Don't be afraid.

576
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,850
I'm not Yoon Ma Ri.

577
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:23,720
Why is Woo Ha Kyung...

578
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,850
I know where my wife is.

579
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:27,490
Let's stop talking about your wife.

580
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:29,075
I'll go see her...

581
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,530
right now.

582
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:31,885
Ma Ri.

583
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,485
Let's go home.

584
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:36,655
Yoon Ma Ri.
