1
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:11,525
Let's move her to another place soon.

2
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,095
There are many flowers there, and you can even see the ocean.

3
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,595
I'm sure she'll like it.

4
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,480
Please, make way.

5
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:39,185
Ma'am... Ma'am stay with me.

6
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,785
Ma'am, stay with me.

7
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:55,235
Stay with me.

8
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:09,845
(Episode 27: Goodbye, Thank You For Everything)

9
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,970
You're here.

10
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:35,735
Mother.

11
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:42,980
Give me that.

12
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:45,520
It's my husband.

13
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,485
- Give it back. - Mother.

14
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,225
Who drew this?

15
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:59,025
My daughter drew it for me.

16
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,865
I guess Ma Ri was here.

17
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,770
Yes.

18
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,805
With my son-in-law.

19
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,675
Your son-in-law?

20
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,380
He even wiped my tears.

21
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,445
My son-in-law.

22
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:22,755
They just left.

23
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,225
You didn't see my daughter?

24
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:40,975
I don't know why it's so hard to leave this place.

25
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,375
It feels weird.

26
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,575
Do you want to go to the new place for your mom?

27
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,075
Now?

28
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,955
You can see it before making any decision.

29
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,355
Where is it?

30
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,095
I'll tell you on the way.

31
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,565
Move over!

32
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,570
Yes. We're on our way.

33
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,470
We'll be there in two hours.

34
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,500
Ma Ri is coming too.

35
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:48,135
Yes. I'll see you soon.

36
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,575
(End call)

37
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:53,275
Mom says we can go take a look around.

38
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,750
I couldn't tell you sooner...

39
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,985
because you felt uncomfortable about it.

40
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,755
But I've talked about it with my mom.

41
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,355
We need someone...

42
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:06,860
who can take care of your mom like a family.

43
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,795
I don't know how to thank you.

44
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,030
You can just be nice to me.

45
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,495
And stop saying that we need a break.

46
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,705
I can't live...

47
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,965
without you.

48
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,210
It was my first time...

49
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:32,445
to spend a night with my mom without surveillance or guards...

50
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,215
ever since I got married.

51
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,720
Thank you for letting me...

52
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,795
do that with my mom.

53
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,965
From now on, only think about living a happy life with your mom.

54
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:59,845
How can you not know her daughter's number when you're her caregiver?

55
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,210
Wait.

56
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,580
I think we came to the wrong room.

57
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:06,520
Please, excuse us. Let's go.

58
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,085
yes, sir.

59
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,655
Have some radish soup.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,630
If Ma Ri knows that we found her, she will try to hide again.

61
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,700
- What do we do then? - She will come back soon.

62
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,970
I'm sure she'll be back...

63
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:29,070
in a few days.

64
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,640
Until then,

65
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:33,575
she shouldn't know that we found this place.

66
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,345
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:40,585
I'll catch her no matter what.

68
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,700
Mom, we're here.

69
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,465
Hello.

70
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,590
Nice to meet you.

71
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,885
I'm Yoon Ma Ri.

72
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,590
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:22,295
I'm Jung Won's mom.

74
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,595
Let's go inside.

75
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,840
Where's the chief nurse?

76
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:35,640
She got a few days off.

77
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,580
Now that you're here, get some rest.

78
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,275
Come on in.

79
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,825
What should I say when I see you?

80
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,535
I've thought about it a lot.

81
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,105
But now that we're here,

82
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,635
I just want to say I'm sorry.

83
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,945
Please forgive my son.

84
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,010
No.

85
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,785
He saved my life.

86
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:22,215
He ran into danger because of me.

87
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,885
I'm the one...

88
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,885
who should apologize.

89
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:36,095
I believe we met for a reason.

90
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,835
And life is all about finding out the reason.

91
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:45,575
You've been strong this whole time.

92
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,195
Did you look around the rooms?

93
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,900
I think the room at the end of the hall would be good.

94
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,470
You think?

95
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,335
Ma Ri, you should go take a look later.

96
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:17,480
Thank you.

97
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,880
I'll be gone for a seminar for a few days.

98
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:23,945
Let's bring her here as soon as I come back.

99
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:26,085
Okay.

100
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,925
Have some.

101
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,165
Thank you for the food.

102
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:51,905
The chief nurse who's worked here for a long time will look after her.

103
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,745
And they have the necessary medical facilities here.

104
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,895
My mom...

105
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:21,135
will love this place like a child.

106
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,875
So don't worry about your mom anymore.

107
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,395
Do you want to take a look around here?

108
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:51,135
There's someplace I need to be.

109
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,735
Okay. Go ahead.

110
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:57,435
Ha Kyung. I wanted...

111
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,810
to live with you...

112
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,475
and grow old with you.

113
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,115
At some point,

114
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,115
I found out about your betrayal,

115
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,885
but I sank it deep inside my heart.

116
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:16,855
I just prayed for you coming back to me someday.

117
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,670
But now I know...

118
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,735
it was a stupid prayer.

119
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,535
In my heart where a thorn of a betrayer got stuck,

120
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,435
all I have left is hatred.

121
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,645
And now I will forget...

122
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,515
about the hatred...

123
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,755
and disillusion.

124
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:48,295
I don't want to be bound with you by those feelings.

125
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,025
So now I'm really...

126
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:57,665
going to leave you.

127
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:10,250
Look at the flowers.

128
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,985
They are beautiful.

129
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,655
I grow them myself.

130
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,830
I think Jung Won loves plants...

131
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,165
because you love them.

132
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:32,135
This is a flower that grows in a field.

133
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,170
But one day,

134
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:37,135
it bloomed in my garden.

135
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:41,915
It's pretty.

136
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,580
What's the name of it?

137
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,285
A gentian.

138
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,350
A gentian.

139
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,885
Love in sadness.

140
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,525
That's what the flower means.

141
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:02,365
It's not hard to be with someone when you're happy.

142
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,235
But if you can embrace someone's sorrow,

143
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:09,275
I think it's true love.

144
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,775
I guess Jung Won...

145
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:17,145
is looking for love like that.

146
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,305
President Kang In Wook wants to meet you.

147
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,785
It isn't supposed to be so hard...

148
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,025
to meet you.

149
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:09,860
What are you doing?

150
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,625
Don't be surprised though.

151
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,430
I just needed a place where we can talk in private.

152
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,840
What do you want to talk about?

153
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,135
You're about to lose your job...

154
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,870
and hard-earned reputation...

155
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:24,540
just because you loved someone else's wife.

156
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,840
It's because of common sense.

157
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,210
My gosh.

158
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:30,645
You don't even know what you did wrong.

159
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,350
All right.

160
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,620
I don't mean to be bothering you.

161
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,515
It turns out you're just pitiful.

162
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:40,220
Your brother never stays out of trouble,

163
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:44,255
and your father ran away leaving debt behind him.

164
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,025
It's not like you went from rags-to-riches.

165
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,730
It's more like trash-to-riches.

166
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,365
Impressive.

167
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,905
I should get going.

168
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,035
Hey.

169
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:59,305
I just want to talk about life.

170
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,750
About the strong and smart guy,

171
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,645
Ha Seong Ho.

172
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,645
You went to college...

173
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,950
thanks to your friend's rich parents.

174
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,460
And you even worked as a director at Seo Jung Won's clinic.

175
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:17,495
But you ruined everything because of a woman.

176
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,765
What a shame.

177
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:26,035
What are you trying to tell me?

178
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,475
My wife.

179
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,415
Yoon Ma Ri.

180
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,785
Doctor Seo and his wife are hiding her.

181
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,125
You dragged me down to the bottom.

182
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:49,255
What do you think you can get from me?

183
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,765
I don't know anything about it.

184
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,535
Doctor Ha.

185
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,765
You think this is the bottom?

186
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,765
It goes down much further.

187
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,790
Ha... Ha Kyung.

188
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,425
You recognize her.

189
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,840
Are you feeling all right?

190
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,340
I think I have an upset stomach.

191
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,745
- An upset stomach? - I think so.

192
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,475
Give me your hand.

193
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,220
- What are you doing? - You have an upset stomach.

194
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,815
Gosh.

195
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,320
Your hand is so cold.

196
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,120
I know. It's cold.

197
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:53,960
What are you doing? It tickles.

198
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:56,495
It's cold. Just wait.

199
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:13,775
Ha Kyung.

200
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,185
Ha Kyung?

201
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,755
No, Ha Kyung.

202
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,585
Ha Kyung.

203
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:25,285
Wake up.

204
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,685
Wake up, Ha Kyung!

205
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,825
No, Ha Kyung!

206
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,275
No. I've been through so much to come this far.

207
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,935
Darn it.

208
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:28,450
I got this from the driver of the other car in the accident.

209
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:31,390
The accident was concluded as negligence on Woo Ha Kyung part.

210
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,555
But he kept this video just in case.

211
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,190
Doctor Ha.

212
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,560
How could you run away...

213
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,965
when she was badly wounded like this?

214
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,365
At the time of the accident,

215
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:51,035
I thought Ha Kyung was already dead.

216
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,410
Then why did you not call the police?

217
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,675
There was no chance that she would survive.

218
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,585
The fact that Ha Kyung died after...

219
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,355
staying a vegetable for five years...

220
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,455
is a miracle.

221
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,765
What did you just say?

222
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,965
Woo Ha Kyung...

223
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,805
is dead?

224
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,445
Then...

225
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,315
Then...

226
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,785
The woman who lives with Seo Jung Won, Woo Ha Kyung...

227
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,725
Who is she?

228
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,495
Who?

229
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,335
Who is she?

230
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,505
Who on earth is she?

231
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:20,955
Your hand is cold.

232
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,305
Once your mom gets here,

233
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,675
you should get divorced.

234
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:45,585
I've tried everything to separate from him.

235
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:49,115
But nothing worked.

236
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:53,085
You were alone back then.

237
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,525
But you're with me now.

238
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,135
I found a good divorce lawyer and consulted with him.

239
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:08,605
You'll be in danger.

240
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,715
I, too, once...

241
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:23,085
ran away feeling afraid.

242
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,955
Knowing about my wife's betrayal,

243
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:32,025
I was afraid to face the truth, so I just avoided it...

244
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,465
and kept it to myself.

245
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,435
But...

246
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:40,735
I shouldn't have done that.

247
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:45,045
Let's not avoid anything anymore.

248
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,345
Let's not run away.

249
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,750
We will face the problem and fight against it.

250
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:55,955
He's a lot scarier...

251
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,285
and crueler...

252
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:02,290
than you imagine.

253
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,525
There must be a way.

254
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,825
I'll be stronger.

255
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,495
And I need you to be strong.

256
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,275
(Woo Ha Kyung)

257
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:46,525
People usually sign contracts,

258
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:48,230
but I see you've brought your seal?

259
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,030
It's the first seal...

260
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:53,535
I engraved myself after I rose from my sickbed.

261
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:56,440
It's like starting a new life.

262
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:59,505
The seal means a lot to me.

263
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,945
Woo Ha Kyung...

264
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,685
is dead...

265
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:09,815
and buried here?

266
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:14,425
Then...

267
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,325
Then...

268
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,995
Who is the woman I met?

269
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,365
Who is she?

270
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:48,525
Bring my wife, Ma Ri, or it will be the end of you.

271
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:53,095
Ending your life, Dr. Seo, is more than easy to me.

272
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,035
It's just a matter of time.

273
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,205
Aren't you cold?

274
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,515
I'm fine.

275
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,175
Seo Jung Won.

276
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:12,045
Seo Jung Won was here.

277
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:14,040
Seo Jung Won.

278
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,075
Hey!

279
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,315
Seo Jung Won!

280
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,995
(Episode 28)

281
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,205
Do you want to listen to music?

282
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,145
What song is this?

283
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:33,525
"Loving You in Every Way".

284
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:38,795
"Loving You in Every Way".

285
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,465
How do the lyrics go?

286
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:59,915
"How painful was it?"

287
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:06,155
"How scared were you?"

288
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:15,265
"When you approached me with sadness,"

289
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,965
"I was standing in the desert."

290
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:23,805
"Out of loneliness,"

291
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,980
"I backed away sometimes."

292
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:31,310
Why did you have to betray me and put me in pain?

293
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,145
Why?

294
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:35,885
Why did you have to do that to me?

295
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,755
"Counting my footsteps."

296
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,165
"Now, you're..."

297
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:58,745
"Maybe you are..."

298
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,515
"the light..."

299
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,745
"that lights up my gloomy life..."

300
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,515
"and embraces my cold soul."

301
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,955
"Now, you're..."

302
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:22,665
"my way."

303
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:27,105
"Love only in happiness can't be true love."

304
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:29,905
"I love you..."

305
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:34,975
"in sadness."

306
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,415
"I love you..."

307
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,855
"in pain."

308
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:49,855
"Even if it's sad..."

309
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,055
"or painful,"

310
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,595
"I'm happy..."

311
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:58,235
"because it's you."

312
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:05,905
"I'll protect you."

313
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:09,515
"The flower that blooms only in my heart."

314
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:15,285
"I'll protect you."

315
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,315
You missed them?

316
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,720
They shook off the tail and disappeared,

317
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,015
but you found out only after you went to his house?

318
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:22,520
I'm sorry.

319
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:26,020
I think they tried to look for them before reporting this to me.

320
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,655
Maybe they went to...

321
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:30,055
the workroom of that woman...

322
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,365
who called herself Woo Ha Kyung.

323
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:45,365
Take all her stuff...

324
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,000
and compare her fingerprints.

325
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,270
What? With whose?

326
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,470
Ma Ri.

327
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:53,240
Compare Ms. Woo's fingerprints with your wife's?

328
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,075
- I don't understand what you mean. - Just do as I say.

329
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:02,315
Do it right now.

330
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:04,685
Yes, sir.

331
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:27,640
The person you're calling isn't available at the moment.

332

(Doctor Seo Jung Won)

335
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:46,065
Sir.

336
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:50,030
- Where are you heading to? - It's none of your business.

337
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:52,635
Call me as soon as you get the fingerprint comparison.

338
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:06,415
You...

339
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:08,215
You.

340
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,755
Who are you?

341
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:14,355
The way she looked at me.

342
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,465
Was it you, Ma Ri?

343
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,165
No, no.

344
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:27,105
No way.

345
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:30,235
It can't be her.

346
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,325
You came here...

347
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:24,730
without notice again.

348
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:26,725
It's not time...

349
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:29,235
to enjoy music at ease.

350
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,035
I'm selecting which music to use for the exhibition.

351
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:35,270
Curators have a lot of work indeed.

352
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,905
They have to select paintings and music,

353
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,245
and they have to choose between truth and deception too.

354
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:45,945
Do you have more...

355
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:47,450
to ask?

356
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,520
Seo Jung Won and Woo Ha Kyung...

357
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:52,120
aren't at the house or the workroom.

358
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,760
I want you...

359
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:57,790
to tell me where they are.

360
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:01,425
Maybe they went on a trip. They're married, you know.

361
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,865
They're married?

362
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,270
- Yes. - President Kang,

363
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:13,610
the results are out.

364
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:15,605
But this is strange.

365
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:19,315
- Go on. - I don't understand.

366
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,915
Ms. Woo's fingerprints match with your wife's fingerprints.

367
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:34,695
Did you say they're married?

368
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,070
What is going on?

369
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:38,665
Too bad for you.

370
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,765
I just...

371
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,435
finished...

372
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,245
putting the puzzle together.

373
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:55,215
Woo Ha Kyung.

374
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,055
No,

375
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,260
tell me where Ma Ri is. I'm sure you know it.

376
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:02,760
Where is she? Tell me!

377
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:05,225
Stop being obsessive already!

378
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,695
What?

379
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,405
Let me guess...

380
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:20,605
why your wife...

381
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:23,515
ran away from you.

382
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,885
It's the same reason...

383
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:36,395
why your mother...

384
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,325
left you.

385
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:43,365
- That's enough. - No.

386
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:47,265
I always wanted to tell you this.

387
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:50,175
You were...

388
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:54,275
a sweet boy who wanted to protect your mother...

389
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,575
from your father's abuse.

390
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,885
But you couldn't.

391
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:05,685
She suffered from his violence,

392
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:09,355
and one day, left this world by the hands of your evil dad,

393
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:12,795
leaving you behind alone.

394
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,825
It traumatized you.

395
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:18,935
Stop it.

396
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,035
And...

397
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,870
you let your resentment,

398
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,675
anger, and longing toward your mother...

399
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,515
swallow you.

400
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:37,955
The sweet boy...

401
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:42,795
grew up without being loved by anyone.

402
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,295
It made him resemble his father,

403
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,395
whom he despised so much.

404
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,265
His father's abuse...

405
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:58,475
turned him into a monster...

406
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:02,775
who's ignorant about love.

407
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:06,220
Stop... Stop.

408
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,815
Stop.

409
00:40:08,423 --> 00:40:09,985
Stop it.

410
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,790
Stop already.

411
00:40:12,794 --> 00:40:14,290
Stop!

412
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,125
Stop! Stop...

413
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:20,030
Stop it.

414
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:23,965
Stop it. Stop...

415
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,835
Stop...

416
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:36,815
Stop...

417
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:42,015
Poor man.

418
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:47,455
I told you.

419
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:52,195
I'm a lot like you.

420
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:56,735
Whenever I see you,

421
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:59,265
I'm reminded of myself.

422
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,435
You see,

423
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,580
I can fix...

424
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,715
your broken heart.

425
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,915
So...

426
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:16,315
get over Yoon Ma Ri,

427
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:19,485
who abandoned you.

428
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,945
This is so fun.

429
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:45,375
Thanks for the amusing story.

430
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,545
Are you a psychiatrist or what?

431
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,485
But...

432
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:52,885
you see,

433
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,465
I'm not here...

434
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:02,465
to listen to your lecture.

435
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,685
(Vice-Director Joo Hae Ra)

436
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,990
Hello?

437
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,265
Where are you?

438
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:38,995
I'm outside.

439
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:42,765
I guess you aren't in Seoul.

440
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,805
Yes.

441
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:48,780
Are you there...

442
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:50,645
with Jung Won?

443
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:56,315
Yes.

444
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:02,685
When are you coming back?

445
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:09,900
I'm not sure about that.

446
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:12,365
I'll have to ask him.

447
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:16,235
What's the matter?

448
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,775
Tell her to come here.

449
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:25,215
Listen.

450
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:31,285
You...

451
00:43:33,327 --> 00:43:34,690
must not come back.

452
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,760
- Don't come back! - Ms. Joo.

453
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:38,395
Hello?

454
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:40,230
What's going on, Hae Ra?

455
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:41,825
Hello?

456
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,945
Ma Ri?

457
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:08,385
We should meet again...

458
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,595
like in the past.

459
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,295
You better.

460
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,695
I know my kind wife...

461
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:20,735
can't stand...

462
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:22,440
seeing someone innocent hurt.

463
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:23,540
Don't come here.

464
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,875
You should never...

465
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:29,815
Listen carefully.

466
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,115
Come to the art gallery...

467
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,055
by midnight.

468
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:39,415
If you show up,

469
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:41,690
I'll forgive you for everything.

470
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:43,230
But if you don't,

471
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,195
I don't know...

472
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,325
what will happen to this woman.

473
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:49,365
You may look forward to it.

474
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:53,305
What are you doing?

475
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:55,865
Come back and ask me for forgiveness.

476
00:44:57,745 --> 00:44:59,975
Say that you missed me.

477
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,380
That you missed me like I did.

478
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:04,715
That it almost drove you crazy.

479
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:07,785
That's all you have to do.

480
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:09,590
If you do,

481
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,385
my pain and anger will disappear like always.

482
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:15,725
Ma Ri.

483
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,695
The world will go back to peace.

484
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,595
It's something...

485
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:25,595
only you...

486
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:28,905
can do.

487
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:04,505
Dinner's ready.

488
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,405
Okay.

489
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:09,545
I'll go out.

490
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,715
Come out when you're ready.

491
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,800
Is something wrong?

492
00:46:30,805 --> 00:46:32,835
I'm sorry.

493
00:46:34,508 --> 00:46:36,705
I know it's shameful of me.

494
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:38,575
What do you mean?

495
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:40,675
Please...

496
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:43,745
take good care of my mom.

497
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,315
Is that what you've been concerned about?

498
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,755
You don't have to worry about her anymore.

499
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:13,410
I'll get changed and come out.

500
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,045
Okay.

501
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:00,825
Ma Ri.

502
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:10,065
(Don't worry.)

503
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,440
Don't worry.

504
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:22,105
I'm not running away again.

505
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:26,680
To be happy with you,

506
00:48:26,687 --> 00:48:28,885
I'm mustering up my courage.

507
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,425
The person you're calling isn't available at the moment.

508
00:49:13,734 --> 00:49:15,630
Even if...

509
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:18,165
I don't get to see you again,

510
00:49:18,906 --> 00:49:21,405
like adorable sweet peas,

511
00:49:21,675 --> 00:49:24,205
I want to send a happy goodbye...

512
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:27,680
to you who taught me...

513
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:29,915
what love is.

514
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:35,545
Goodbye, Thank You for Everything.

515
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:50,370
(Love in Sadness)

516
00:49:50,371 --> 00:49:51,430
Change it...

517
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:53,270
back to her original face.

518
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:55,100
The face that I love.

519
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:57,905
Do it. Change...

520
00:49:58,312 --> 00:50:00,010
my face again.

521
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:01,240
I can't do that.

522
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,680
Please.

523
00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:04,750
If I die,

524
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,250
everything will end.

525
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,380
Seo Jung Won.

526
00:50:07,388 --> 00:50:10,120
He's the one who has to die.

527
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:11,715
Ma Ri.

528
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:13,625
Ma Ri!
