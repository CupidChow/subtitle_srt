00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,360
Seo Jung Won.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,460
We need to meet up right now.

3
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:14,230
Why?

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,600
Why do I have to meet you?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,430
You'll desperately want...

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,905
to meet me once you hear this.

7
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,630
There's only one bullet in here.

8
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,140
In Wook.

9
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:25,700
In Wook, please stop.

10
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,140
I can prove my love for her again and again.

11
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,070
I'd rather die...

12
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,115
than part with you.

13
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:33,985
In Wook! Please!

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,855
This isn't everything.

15
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:42,190
I have more evidence to drag you down.

16
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,865
If you're curious,

17
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:47,805
come here.

(290 Mulbit-ro, Yeongdeungpo-Gu, Seoul)

19
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,685
You'll have to go.

20
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,325
Because it seems like...

21
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:10,595
he received my message.

22
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,680
What?

23
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,995
I sent him footage of you hitting me.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,395
I had no choice...

25
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,935
if I wanted to escape that place.

26
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:37,255
(Episode 37: I Will Never Change)

27
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:00,270
Postpone...

28
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,570
the surgery.

29
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,440
Sorry? They're all ready.

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,370
Postpone it!

31
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,175
This instant.

32
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,235
Isn't your hospital about to close down?

33
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,660
I guess you're doing all right so far.

34
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:04,575
I'm not afraid of losing my hospital...

35
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,635
and the people's trust.

36
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:08,870
What I'm afraid of is...

37
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:12,745
Ma Ri withering in your hands.

38
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,080
Are you trying to see...

39
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,750
which one of us is crazier?

40
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,655
That doesn't sound too bad.

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,420
I have a few more things to tell the media about you.

42
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,820
There's nothing I can't do.

43
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:31,265
I'll do anything and everything.

44
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,960
Until...

45
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,330
you are loathed...

46
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,300
by every single person,

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,060
I will never stop.

48
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,075
Then how about this?

49
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,550
You'll receive a criminal punishment for domestic violence.

50
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:59,880
It'll be enough to file for a divorce.

51
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,695
Ma Ri...

52
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,460
came back to me on her own.

53
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,265
I will expose your violence, threat, and confinement...

54
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,665
to the world.

55
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:12,335
Let Ma Ri and her mother go.

56
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:15,145
If not, you'll see this on the news.

57
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,110
If you don't...

58
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,555
erase that file this instant,

59
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,755
you will never see her again.

60
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,695
Before that,

61
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,890
you'll witness everything that you wanted to protect...

62
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:39,760
crumble down like a sand castle.

("About Kang In Wook of Gunha Construction")

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,830
One click of the button...

65
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,770
and the entire world will know...

66
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:51,170
about your disgusting doings of controlling your wife...

67
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:53,245
through violence and fear.

68
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,855
It will also reveal my location.

69
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:02,485
The people will see us in real time.

70
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,855
If you want to do worse, do so.

71
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:11,935
Choose.

72
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,605
Whether to lose everything...

73
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,235
or let go of Ma Ri.

74
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,380
Don't get smart with me.

75
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:37,180
I locked the video and sent it to the media.

76
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:39,955
If I tell them the password, they can access it.

77
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:42,265
I have many duplicates as well.

78
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,055
Decide.

79
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,455
Will you stay with me...

80
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:46,095
or go with him?

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,060
It's your decision.

82
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,445
You can go to him...

83
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,700
or...

84
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,475
stay here...

85
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,915
by my side.

86
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:22,265
- I... - Please be considerate.

87
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,490
I want to leave...

88
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,595
this place.

89
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,005
I want to leave.

90
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,445
Please let me.

91
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,900
Ma Ri.

92
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,870
I forever repent...

93
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,785
for hurting you, so...

94
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,690
Where are you going?

95
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,865
This is our home, so where are you going?

96
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,545
If...

97
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,285
If you leave me as well,

98
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,455
what should I do?

99
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,095
Your mother...

100
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,035
didn't abandon you.

101
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,500
She...

102
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:44,600
She felt too suffocated to live in the same world as your father.

103
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,300
That's why...

104
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,470
she had no choice but to do so.

105
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,485
She never...

106
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,185
abandoned you.

107
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,520
Look at my face.

108
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,180
The face of your mother that you wanted to see in me...

109
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:02,220
is no longer here.

110
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,060
So...

111
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,035
please let me go.

112
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,565
Let go of your mother...

113
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,075
and me.

114
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,045
I...

115
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,875
I don't want to die.

116
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:23,545
I want to live.

117
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,975
Go.

118
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,580
Mom.

119
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:08,125
Mom. Mom, wake up. Let's go.

120
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,995
Hurry. We have to leave.

121
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,140
Ms. Yoon? You're letting her go?

122
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,840
Let her go.

123
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:32,285
Do you mean outside?

124
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:34,385
Yes.

125
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,155
Open the door.

126
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,225
Open it.

127
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,325
Mom.

128
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:13,655
Hello.

129
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,455
Have you been well?

130
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,385
It must've been difficult.

131
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,525
But you pulled through.

132
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,395
Please let this be the light at the end of the tunnel.

133
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:02,860
Please let this be...

134
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,335
the end of my misfortunes.

135
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,610
Where...

136
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,455
are we going?

137
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,025
It doesn't matter...

138
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:59,325
as long as I'm with you.

139
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,875
Please let me go.

140
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,215
Let go of your mother...

141
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,855
and me.

142
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,380
Welcome.

143
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,255
I've been waiting for you.

144
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,125
Let's go.

145
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,300
Hello.

146
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:30,270
I am...

147
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,570
almost like a sister to Jung Won.

148
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,385
I'm his best friend, Joo Hae Ra.

149
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:38,910
Hello.

150
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,680
I've prepared dinner for you.

151
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,625
It's takeout though.

152
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,665
Let's go inside.

153
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,765
Let me.

154
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,605
Is she sleeping?

155
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,615
It's a laurel tree.

156
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,880
Peneus turned Daphne into a laurel tree...

157
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:21,885
who wanted to be free from Apollo.

158
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:24,350
From a beautiful fairy...

159
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,780
to spiny bay leaves,

160
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,425
Daphne had to escape.

161
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:33,620
I can relate to that.

162
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,765
To the laurel tree.

163
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,370
You're the winner...

164
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,615
like the symbol of a laurel tree.

165
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,670
He loved me...

166
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,640
whether I was a mess or not,

167
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:24,110
whether my life was filled of complexity or not.

168
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:26,715
He loved me just the way I was.

169
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,950
He didn't care about how I looked on the outside.

170
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,655
He only cared for my soul.

171
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,420
Have you ever...

172
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,530
looked at me like the way he had?

173
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,560
You only care about how I look...

174
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:46,435
and you're deluding yourself that you love me.

175
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,705
Look at my face.

176
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,740
The face of your mother that you wanted to see in me...

177
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,775
is no longer here.

178
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,575
Ma'am, look this way.

179
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,240
Do you like it?

180
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:05,515
Not really.

181
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:07,650
Can you take another one...

182
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,050
with the flowers this time?

183
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:12,425
Sure thing.

184
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,135
Do you like it?

185
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,175
Goodness. It's beautiful.

186
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,530
Ma'am, should we take a picture together?

187
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,015
3, 2, 1.

188
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,640
Because you like flowers,

189
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,315
let's take another one with the flowers this time.

190
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,425
Ma Ri.

191
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,550
Yes?

192
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,065
You can breathe now.

193
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:14,810
Your mother...

194
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,685
didn't abandon you.

195
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,390
She felt too suffocated to live in the same world as your father.

196
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,150
That's why...

197
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,160
she had no choice but to do so.

198
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,165
She never...

199
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,065
abandoned you.

200
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,360
I'll be back right after my morning operation.

201
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,600
Let's go to my mom's house together.

202
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,305
Okay. See you.

203
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:16,685
Oh, right.

204
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:25,425
I already miss you.

205
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:35,635
I'll be back soon.

206
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:58,025
(President Go Sung Cheol)

207
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:01,920
I don't believe it.

208
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:03,690
I've already been replaced.

209
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,965
I only heard that the new president was announced.

210
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,505
I didn't know it would be so quick.

211
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,375
Did you find what I asked?

212
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:16,770
This is a document related to the chairman's slush fund.

213
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:20,245
I have all the list of clients and pictures as proof.

214
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,615
That's good.

215
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:29,880
Get the divorce papers ready as well.

216
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,650
- What was that? - The one for mutual consent.

217
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,620
Are you going to let her go?

218
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:36,395
Why?

219
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,895
Do you think I'm not able to do that?

220
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:41,135
No.

221
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:43,205
I'll get them ready.

222
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,275
(Operating room)

223
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,400
Aren't you getting ready?

224
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,040
Doctor Seo...

225
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:59,480
- Yes. - The patient scheduled...

226
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,410
for the morning surgery cancelled.

227
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,250
There are people protesting outside the hospital.

228
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,655
Who would want to get surgery from here?

229
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,390
I checked...

230
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:12,365
and more than half of this week's surgeries were cancelled.

231
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,590
Mom.

232
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,775
We're going to move to a much better place.

233
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:23,770
There are flowers and you can see the ocean.

234
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,375
There are nice people there too.

235
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,110
Once you get there,

236
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,485
I'm sure you'll like it.

237
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,355
I'm so happy.

238
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,520
Hello?

239
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:48,705
I knew you would be there.

240
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,060
I have something to give you.

241
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,200
I won't meet you.

242
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:58,045
Okay.

243
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,300
Then I'll deliver the divorce papers.

244
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,870
But...

245
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:04,440
we will still have to meet up at least once.

246
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,980
Both parties...

247
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,125
have to show up at court.

248
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:33,445
Come in.

249
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,480
What brings you here?

250
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,555
I have something to give you.

251
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,865
You keep beautiful flowers with you...

252
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,065
in your office and your house.

253
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:54,595
Foxgloves.

254
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,560
A fairy that was disliked in the Irish legend.

255
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,230
That fairy...

256
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:03,930
bullied other fairies out of spite.

257
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,540
The God of Rage took her into the mountain...

258
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,715
and turned her into flowers...

259
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,255
so that she would stop bullying other fairies.

260
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,380
The only reason why the flowers are beautiful is because of his mercy.

261
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,625
But if you smell them,

262
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,450
they stink.

263
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:24,690
It's to prevent others from approaching...

264
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,665
and to constantly remind people of the bad deed.

265
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:31,435
I'm not here for stories.

266
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:39,075
These are divorce papers.

267
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,015
I'm going to divorce her.

268
00:27:42,678 --> 00:27:44,440
Tell Ma Ri.

269
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,315
I look forward...

270
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,355
seeing her in court on the day of our divorce.

271
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,930
(Divorce Agreement)

00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:23,455

(We demand you to close down your hospital due to malpractice!)

275
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:43,075
- Why did you bring that flower? - This?

276
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:47,345
Because it reminded me of myself.

277
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:51,885
A deity turned an evil fairy into a flower.

278
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,415
It smells awful.

279
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,725
This is why I hate deities.

280
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,695
I'm sure Foxglove...

281
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,525
wasn't a bad fairy to begin with.

282
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,395
Here.

283
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:39,520
(Divorce Agreement)

284
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,835
He came to my office and asked me to hand this to you.

285
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:47,900
I can't believe this.

286
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:50,275
We're almost there.

287
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:53,375
Freedom is right around the corner.

288
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:07,080
Mom, are you happy?

289
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:10,425
Yes, I am.

290
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:21,930
Yes?

291
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:23,975
Put Ma Ri on the phone.

292
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:27,345
I need to speak with her about our divorce.

293
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:39,255
(President Kang In Wook)

294
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:45,025
It's me.

295
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,190
Let's file in our divorce papers.

296
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,765
Let's do it today before I change my mind.

297
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,800
I want it to be just us two when we say our final goodbye.

298
00:30:56,805 --> 00:31:00,270
We were the only ones who entered the wedding hall,

299
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,145
so it should be...

300
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,515
just us two who enter the court.

301
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:08,215
Come to my house.

302
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:13,080
No. Not there.

303
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,850
Then...

304
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:17,365
come to the restaurant we frequented.

305
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,835
In an hour.

306
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:22,090
If it goes past that,

307
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,565
I'm sure I will change my mind.

308
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,975
The divorce...

309
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,845
will no longer happen.

310
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:44,280
I should go.

311
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:46,050
Not alone.

312
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:48,080
Let's drop your mother off and go together.

313
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:49,820
If he sees me with you,

314
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,360
I don't know how he'll react.

315
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,220
I'll go by myself.

316
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:58,260
I need to see him for the last time if I want to end this for good.

317
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,700
Meet him tomorrow.

318
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:02,445
I'll call him right now.

319
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:07,740
I need to do this before he changes his mind.

320
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,310
I started this relationship,

321
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:12,715
so I need to end it.

322
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:16,725
I won't run away anymore.

323
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:21,095
I'll regain my freedom and return with a laurel on my head.

324
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,395
You don't have to worry.

325
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:31,005
Give me a minute.

326
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:46,785
Take this with you.

327
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,885
I was going to give it on our way there.

328
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,180
Call me.

329
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:54,620
Just in case,

330
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:57,265
I've downloaded a GPS application.

331
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,490
Okay.

332
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:03,435
If you're in the slightest danger,

333
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,665
call me immediately.

334
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:07,960
We can...

335
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,090
head straight to the court, right?

336
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,165
Let's eat first.

337
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,030
- I don't have much... - I've already ordered.

338
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:18,175
It's your favourite.

339
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,115
This will be...

340
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,785
our last meal together.

341
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,060
Mother, I'm home.

342
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,605
- Welcome. - Hello, ma'am.

343
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,175
We're finally here. Come out.

344
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,175
Be careful.

345
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,000
Welcome. I've heard a lot about you.

346
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,185
You must've struggled a lot.

347
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:05,425
This place is safe.

348
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,930
Shall we have a drink?

349
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:24,400
I have somewhere to go after this.

350
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,215
I see.

351
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,085
I wonder...

352
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,985
where we went wrong.

353
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,555
Ma Ri.

354
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:41,595
I thought I'd be okay.

355
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:45,325
But seeing you in front of me makes me lose my confidence.

356
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:47,720
Do you think this divorce...

357
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,605
will help me...

358
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:52,230
forget you?

359
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,205
You have said...

360
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:58,305
the same things over and over again.

361
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,070
That you'll change, that you'll be better,

362
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,585
that you'll never do it again.

363
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:05,880
I no longer...

364
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,055
believe in those words.

365
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,580
I won't hate you anymore.

366
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,380
I won't stay by your side and pity you anymore.

367
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:16,625
I won't pray for you to change anymore.

368
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:18,765
I'm exhausted.

369
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,435
You should...

370
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,030
find out where the cause of your rage and hatred lies in.

371
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,860
Only once you overcome that...

372
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,545
will you be able to heal yourself.

373
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:34,375
The cause...

374
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,715
of my rage and hatred?

375
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:39,515
Are you talking about my mom?

376
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:43,410
All right.

377
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,320
I'll heal it.

378
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,650
I'll go to a hospital.

379
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,950
I'll get treated for every wound I have, so...

380
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,525
- In Wook. - One last time.

381
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,195
We are...

382
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,535
over.

383
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,215
I guess...

384
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,715
we are really over.

385
00:37:28,563 --> 00:37:32,205
Don't you worry about anything and just rest.

386
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:34,800
I'll prepare dinner.

387
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:37,730
Once she's settled down, bring her to the main house.

388
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,645
Okay.

389
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,750
You must be tired from the car ride.

390
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,210
Would you like to nap?

391
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:51,985
Ma Ri.

392
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,720
Where's Ma Ri?

393
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:56,120
Ma'am.

394
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:59,390
Ma Ri will fix some things and come here.

395
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:00,760
Don't worry.

396
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:03,890
Please save my poor daughter.

397
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:06,000
My poor baby...

398
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,270
has only suffered because of me.

399
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,415
Please don't let her be alone.

400
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,885
- Ma'am. - Please...

401
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,080
save her. Okay?

402
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:22,885
I will.

403
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,425
I will do that.

(Seoul Family Court)

406
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,545
It wasn't easy...

407
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:49,315
for me to let you go.

408
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,645
This is our final moments together.

409
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:55,455
I hope you can focus on me.

410
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,055
I beg you.

412
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:20,615
The final destination of our marriage...

413
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:23,470
is right there.

414
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:26,315
It must've been a difficult decision to make.

415
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,380
Thank you.

416
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,825
It's such a pity...

417
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,125
that we have come to this.

418
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:58,310
What are you doing?

419
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,485
Remember that day when I borrowed...

420
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:04,150
an entire amusement park because you told me...

421
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,925
that you had never been to one?

422
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:08,890
Back then,

423
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,195
you looked so happy.

424
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:13,520
Come to think of it,

425
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:17,365
we were the happiest when we did...

426
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,135
trivial things.

427
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:24,305
I wanted to see you smile one last time,

428
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:26,840
so I borrowed that place again.

429
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,685
- What? - Come with me...

430
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:33,055
to our place of memories one last time.

431
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:35,340
I want to remember...

432
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,455
that during our final moments,

433
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,720
we were happy.

434
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,095
- Turn the car around. - I will divorce you.

435
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:44,790
Don't worry.

436
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,635
This is...

437
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,720
my last favour.

438
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:51,665
Turn the car around this instant.

439
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:01,275
(Address Book)

440
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:23,305
We agreed to go to court.

441
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:28,835
Then...

442
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,845
let's just talk somewhere.

443
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:34,245
It won't take long.

444
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,600
Where are we going?

445
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,415
Let me out.

446
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,570
It won't take long.

447
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:09,210
I have nothing more to say to you.

448
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,345
Let me out.

449
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,010
If you won't let me, then I have no choice...

450
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:17,385
but to get out myself.

451
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:32,130
I was wrong to have believed you.

452
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,830
I just want to talk.

453
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,930
What's so wrong about that?

454
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:37,775
Let me go.

455
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:42,115
Stop running away for once.

456
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,940
I just want...

457
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:46,045
to talk.

458
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,670
What did you infuriate me again?

459
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:48,775
Why? Why again?

460
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:16,805
There was a time...

461
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:22,345
when we were happy.

462
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:25,185
There was a time...

463
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:27,855
when you smiled at me.

464
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:31,225
You comforted me...

465
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:34,355
and held my hand.

466
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,865
Back then,

467
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:42,335
I truly thought...

468
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,965
that we'd be happy forever.

469
00:44:56,744 --> 00:44:58,785
Back then,

470
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,685
you did...

471
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:06,855
love me, right?

472
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,505
Back then,

473
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:27,575
you did...

474
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:31,345
love me, right?

475
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:37,655
You can tell me that.

476
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:40,425
This is our last moment.

477
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:47,595
I'm sorry...

478
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:53,205
that I couldn't...

479
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:56,235
love you.

480
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:07,455
I tried so hard,

481
00:46:07,882 --> 00:46:10,555
but your wounds were too deep.

482
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,095
Let me tell you again.

483
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:16,865
I'm not your mother.

484
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:19,995
So you should...

485
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,015
I think it's really time...

486
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:37,915
to say goodbye.

487
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,095
You may kill me,

488
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:55,795
but you may never have me.

489
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,805
Because...

490
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,635
I'll die while loving someone else.

491
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:10,785
Is that so?

492
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:15,085
If that's so...

493
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:18,825
If you can't love me for who I am,

494
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:23,595
then I'll look for a way...

495
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,135
to win your heart back.

496
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,865
Like him,

497
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,905
I won't focus on your face,

498
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:38,305
but on what you have in your heart.

499
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:46,380
What are you doing?

500
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,655
I will still love you...

501
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:51,780
even if I lose my eyes.

502
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,080
So please don't go.

503
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,520
Don't do this. Please.

504
00:47:55,522 --> 00:47:57,865
Your face will be...

505
00:47:58,058 --> 00:47:59,865
the very last thing...

506
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:01,660
I'll remember.

507
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:03,535
And I'll...

508
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,125
Ma Ri!

509
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,595
Ma Ri!

510
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:37,665
Ma Ri!

511
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:41,475
Would you like to hear a simple story about laurel trees?

512
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,175
In a cold world,

513
00:48:45,272 --> 00:48:49,015
there was an elderly couple who had warm hearts.

514
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:50,840
One day, they were out in the garden...

515
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,810
and talking about the past.

516
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:54,340
Suddenly,

517
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,925
leaves started forming from their bodies.

518
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,120
They loved each other so much...

519
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,520
that they wanted to die together.

520
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,425
- Ma Ri! - The deity granted their wish.

521
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,165
Ma Ri!

522
00:49:09,063 --> 00:49:11,660
It's not that simple.

523
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:13,430
It's a story about never-ending love.

524
00:49:13,434 --> 00:49:15,030
Ma Ri!

525
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,600
That's...

526
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:19,505
the hardest...

527
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,570
and most valuable story in this world.

528
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:25,615
Let's love each other for a long time...

529
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:28,610
and become trees that share...

530
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:30,585
the same roots and branches.

531
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:33,720
Even when we die,

532
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,295
let's hold onto each other.

533
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:38,225
Let's love like that.

534
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:53,670
I Will Never Change.

535
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:55,675
(I Will Never Change)
