2
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,920
Help.

3
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,780
Is anybody here?

4
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,545
Help.

5
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,245
In Wook.

6
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:08,005
Ma Ri.

7
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,315
Ma Ri.

(Episode 39: I Love You Even When You Are Sad)

9
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:27,195
Ma Ri. Ma Ri?

10
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:28,830
Where's my wife?

11
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,135
She was taken to the ER. Please calm down.

12
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,205
Ma Ri.

13
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:36,170
- Ma Ri. - You need to calm down.

14
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,635
Ma Ri.

15
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,025
Are you feeling better now?

16
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,100
You lost consciousness in the ambulance.

17
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:07,005
Are you all right?

18
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:09,570
What about my husband?

19
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:11,380
He hurt his eyes, so he needs surgery.

20
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,450
But he's refusing it.

21
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,505
He just keeps looking for you.

22
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,975
Please stay in bed.

23
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,455
Are you feeling better?

24
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,145
Yoon Ma Ri.

25
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,620
Where's my wife?

26
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,215
Ms. Yoon Ma Ri?

27
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,530
She was right here.

28
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:36,185
Where did she go?

29
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,400
We found it.

30
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,910
It seems to be a firearm accident.

31
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:49,465
That's it.

32
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,230
What happened?

33
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,895
There was a firearm accident. Two people were taken to a hospital.

34
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,095
Which hospital?

35
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,600
Sir, where are you going?

36
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,205
Sir.

(Emergency Room)

38
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,795
Yoon Ma Ri!

39
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,670
President Kang.

40
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,265
Are you all right?

41
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,295
My gosh.

42
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,065
Excuse me.

43
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,605
Excuse me.

44
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,040
I'll take you to the ER.

45
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,635
Please help him up.

46
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,615
(Emergency Room)

47
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,160
President Kang, you need the surgery immediately.

48
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,470
Wait. I can't find Ma Ri.

49
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,730
Go find Ma Ri.

50
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,230
If you keep doing this, it will only get worse.

51
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,900
Where's my wife?

52
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,100
- Please calm down. - Go find Ma Ri.

53
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,970
- Calm down. - Where's my wife?

54
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,870
- Please stop it. - Go find her.

55
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,235
You can't do this. Calm down.

56
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,005
Even when you despair...

57
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:54,275
and feel sad,

58
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,915
I love you.

59
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,545
He said it would be the last time.

60
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:06,515
He said he'd let me go.

61
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,595
It's okay.

62
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,475
You're safe now.

63
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,315
Let go of me! Get off!

64
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,630
I don't want to see.

65
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,530
I don't want to see!

66
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,955
Just let me go.

67
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,460
Don't do the surgery.

68
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,130
I don't need it.

69
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,765
Let me go.

70
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,095
Ma Ri.

71
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,995
Ma Ri...

72
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,530
The gates of heaven are open to those who pray...

73
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:56,570
Did you sleep well?

74
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,095
as well as to those shed tears.

75
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,205
Just like the passage from the Talmud,

76
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:04,475
your tears...

77
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,735
will be a key...

78
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:09,805
to the door of your happiness.

79
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,455
I can't stay here.

80
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,455
President Kang.

81
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,925
Where are my clothes?

82
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,910
President Kang, you are not supposed to move now.

83
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,065
The result of the surgery isn't so good.

84
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,235
Sung Wook.

85
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,650
Go distract the police.

86
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,810
I need to go somewhere.

87
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,210
President Kang.

88
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,720
Now.

89
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:46,475
I don't have time.

90
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,485
Okay. I'll be there soon, Mom.

91
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:56,030
She likes that there are flowers outside the window.

92
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,195
You should get better soon and go see your mom.

93
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,455
Yes.

94
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,150
"As an image,"

95
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,615
"it just looked happy and peaceful."

96
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:29,125
"A yellow flame flares up crackling."

97
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:59,915
(We demand you to close down your hospital due to malpractice!)

98
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:08,925
Is Ma Ri here?

99
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,865
No.

100
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,995
She went home.

101
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,065
You've never told me the truth.

102
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,775
Please.

103
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,005
Please go back.

104
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,290
Hello, Hae Ra.

105
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,795
Kang In Wook is going up now.

106
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,895
Okay.

107
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:56,405
Get some rest. I'll be right back.

108
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,565
Where is she?

109
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,735
Where is...

110
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:19,895
Ma Ri?

111
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:06,875
Where is...

112
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:08,745
Ma Ri?

113
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,315
Look at me.

114
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,125
I lost everything.

115
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,455
Let me...

116
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,795
just see if she's okay.

117
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,025
Where's...

118
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,295
Ma Ri?

119
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,620
You still don't get it.

120
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,175
This...

121
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,945
never ends...

122
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:45,355
before Ma Ri or I die.

123
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,185
No.

124
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:53,155
The happy ending is in your hands.

125
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,125
And you already know...

126
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:57,170
how to do it.

127
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,795
No, I don't.

128
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,235
The only thing I know is...

129
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,665
that you have no right...

130
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,535
to poke your nose into our matter.

131
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,305
Not anymore.

132
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:12,680
If it weren't for you,

133
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,450
Ma Ri would've never left me. It's your fault!

134
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,050
So you have to die.

135
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,360
Die.

136
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,455
Just die here.

137
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,945
Fine.

138
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,215
Even if I kill you,

139
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,485
nothing will change.

140
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,755
I get it.

141
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,415
No matter how hard I try,

142
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:30,585
Ma Ri will run away from me again.

143
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,295
And I'll...

144
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,725
be a monster.

145
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:39,295
I should put an end to it now.

146
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:43,305
You...

147
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,580
want Ma Ri to be safe.

148
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:47,075
Then...

149
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,905
you should kill me.

150
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,215
And Ma Ri will be free.

151
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,215
Right here.

152
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:00,915
Push me.

153
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,195
Kang In Wook.

154
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:17,505
You say you love your wife.

155
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,610
But why can't you see the tears she sheds are because of you?

156
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,305
Because I can feel it.

157
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,115
Because I can feel...

158
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:39,155
that she doesn't love me back.

159
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,315
I've tried many times,

160
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,630
but I can't do this myself.

161
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,125
So...

162
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:11,185
you do it.

163
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,655
Once you kill me,

164
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,025
Ma Ri can be free.

165
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,565
Only when you kill me,

166
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,835
Ma Ri can become happy.

167
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,045
Just think about happy moments...

168
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,705
where you smile with your mom.

169
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,845
Here's your chance.

170
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,715
If you miss this chance,

171
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,030
I'll find Ma Ri again.

172
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,585
And...

173
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,570
stay with her forever.

174
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,165
This time,

175
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,435
I will never let her go.

176
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,835
So kill me.

177
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,865
Kill me now!

178
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,780
Why won't you just give up?

179
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,545
Why are you giving her such a hard time?

180
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,220
No one has...

181
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,920
the right to ruin someone else's life.

182
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:10,150
End it. Now!

183
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,415
If I have to kill you to keep her safe...

184
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,025
If I have to kill you...

185
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,355
to protect her...

186

Doctor Seo.

187
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:37,205
Go away.

188
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,685
- Please don't do that. - I said go away!

189
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,160
Please don't do that, Doctor Seo.

190
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,715
Go away!

191
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,790
You can't do this because of me.

192
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,895
Kill me. Just do it.

193
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:57,925
Do it.

194
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:26,760
Kang In Wook.

195
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,230
You have the right to remain silent.

196
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:30,670
You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice.

197
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,600
And anything you say...

198
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:35,210
can be used against you in court.

199
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,005
Do you understand?

200
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,820
(Police)

201
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:55,390
This is Seo Jung Won who provided the video of Kang In Wook's assault.

202
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,855
I just texted you the password to the video.

203
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:02,170
Please make sure put it on TV.

204
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:05,540
17-1, Yongsan-Gu, Hannam-dong.

205
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,035
Is that right?

206
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,880
You went through plastic surgery to avoid his assault?

207
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:23,145
So your husband won't recognize you.

208
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,015
Yes.

209
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:36,425
The statement...

210
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:40,195
for this case...

211
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,575
(Mapo Police Station)

212
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,275
I'm here to give you a ride.

213
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,980
I heard Ma Ri and you were questioned all night.

214
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:54,075
Thank you for your testimony.

215
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,885
It must've been hard for you to do so.

216
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,415
Actually,

217
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:03,685
there's something else I need to tell you.

218
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,165
The night Ha Kyung had the accident,

219
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:13,935
I was with her.

220
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:18,205
So every time I saw you,

221
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:22,175
I felt tormented.

222
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,275
It's all in the past.

223
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:30,245
I'm so tired of resenting...

224
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,515
and hating someone.

225
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:43,625
All right.

226
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,795
Be happy.

227
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,535
Now.

228
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,000
(Kang In Wook of Gunha Construction under police investigation)

229
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,630
Is it true that your wife accused you...

230
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,230
of assault, captivity, and intimidation?

231
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:20,235
Are you the guy in the video?

232
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:24,680
Jung Won, are you watching TV now?

233
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,875
Things are going crazy.

234
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,810
I guess the whole world is learning about Kang In Wook.

235
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:32,180
Your wife said she would reveal relevant evidence in due order.

236
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:33,580
Does it have something to do with your divorce case?

237
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:35,185
Please move away.

238
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,620
What is he saying?

239
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,515
He's getting interviewed now.

240
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,025
I admit...

241
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,895
to everything I've done...

242
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,525
to my wife.

243
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:53,695
But that's not the only thing you should know.

244
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,165
I will also submit the evidential materials...

245
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,835
of corruption scandals implicating incumbent lawmakers...

246
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:03,505
and the slush fund...

247
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,120
of Chairman Kang In Wook.

248
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,880
- Tell us more about the evidence. - Move away.

249
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:08,190
Tell us more about it.

250
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,885
It's too late.

251
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,855
My mom who got beaten up like a caged animal...

252
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,355
killed herself to survive.

253
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:16,590
And I...

254
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,555
couldn't kill myself, so I became a monster.

255
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,295
It's too late...

256
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:23,270
for everyone.

257
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,540
- Move away. - Please say something.

258
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,940
I guess Kang In Wook...

259
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,410
Step aside.

260
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,780
is trying to destroy Gunha Group himself.

261
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,580
It's the truth...

262
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:37,210
that Ma Ri and you have fought for with all your heart.

263
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,880
Great job, Jung Won.

264
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,170
As you instructed,

265
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,240
I've sent the secret information of Gunha Group to the press.

266
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,740
Well done.

267
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:05,605
Check your account.

268
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:07,080
I wired you the money.

269
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:08,410
What?

270
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,445
Stay outside the country for the time being.

271
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,620
No, I'll stay by your side until the end.

272
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:15,245
Do as I say.

273
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,085
Everything...

274
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,755
is over now.

275
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,385
Thank you...

276
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,455
for what you've done.

277
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,770
The prosecution has started investigating...

278
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,670
on Gunha Group's slush fund...

279
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,410
and tax evasion.

280
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,410
It has been found...

281
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:40,140
that Chairman Kang Il Gook is connected with...

282
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,710
a Seoul mob and their illegal lobbying.

283
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,380
The suspicions...

284
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,320
on the death of his wife...

285
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:48,720
is being surfaced as well.

286
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:51,020
Also, the video of President Kang abusing his wife...

287
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,620
has spread throughout the Internet,

288
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:56,155
causing a huge controversy.

289
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,765
What a horrible son.

290
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:08,235
How could you betray the chairman?

291
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:11,110
What are you talking about? You should be grateful for it.

292
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,980
Thanks to me,

293
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,950
you get to escape from this house safely.

294
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:19,375
Everything is ruined because of you.

295
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:20,980
The entire group.

296
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:23,585
It's your plan that's ruined.

297
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,715
When my mom was alive,

298
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,055
you used to be called Secretary Moon.

299
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,730
You must've known what kind of man my father was.

300
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,560
You joined the family for money.

301
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,300
To be the madam of the conglomerate family.

302
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,865
What?

303
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,665
Don't you dare...

304
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,770
talk recklessly about me.

305
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:43,405
You and your father...

306
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,810
are the crazy ones.

307
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,475
Right, all of us are crazy.

308
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,980
Can you say you're sane?

309
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,880
Solely for money,

310
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:55,385
you gave up on being human and chose to get beaten up.

311
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,785
Run away already.

312
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,495
Everything is over.

313
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:19,465
You are...

314
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,635
taking away...

315
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,135
everything that I've achieved...

316
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,235
in the end.

317
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:28,535
You destroyed...

318
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,010
everything that I cherished.

319
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,020
You couldn't protect it...

320
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,715
because you were weak.

321
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:39,655
I think...

322
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,655
I know the bottom of my rage.

323
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,525
It's...

324
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:52,295
you, Father.

325
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,865
It's not me.

326
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,310
Look closely.

327
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:03,105
You despise yourself.

328
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:04,905
No.

329
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,020
It's you.

330
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,815
You say you despise me,

331
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:11,590
but you've become just like me.

332
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:15,455
Like your mom shot herself,

333
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:18,055
it's time...

334
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:21,230
your wife kills herself too.

335
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,765
No.

336
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:24,665
No.

337
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,535
I'm not you!

338
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:35,445
My money. Quickly, pick it up.

339
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:39,115
Hurry.

340
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,435
I think...

341
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:08,435
I understand you now.

342
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,775
You must've been scared.

343
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:17,915
You were scared...

344
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:21,085
you might be left alone...

345
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,855
in this lonely world.

346
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:28,865
Go.

347
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,595
Get out of my sight.

348
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,370
Hae Ra.

349
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,140
I need your help just for today.

350
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,480
Can you do that for me?

351
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,480
Don't worry.

352
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:18,450
I'm almost there.

353
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:19,920
Do a good job with the investigation.

354
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:21,475
Thanks.

355
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,990
You got investigated all night long and went through interviews too.

356
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:30,355
That must've made you sick.

357
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,060
I'll be fine after I take some medicine and get a good rest.

358
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:36,770
The investigation might take long.

359
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:39,965
I asked Hae Ra to come over just in case.

360
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:42,605
Don't worry about me. Go on.

361
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,275
Make sure you take medicine.

362
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,275
Make sure to eat well.

363
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:50,845
Yes.

364
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,225
Hae Ra?

365
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,305
Hae Ra.

366
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,715
Hae Ra.

367
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:08,855
Did I hear it wrong?

368
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,725
She should be here by now.

369
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:14,995
Hae Ra.

370
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,640
- When was it? - Well...

371
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,680
She first visited my hospital 5 months ago.

372
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,175
On Thursday?

373
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,205
Ma Ri, I'm here.

374
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,345
Ma Ri.

375
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,485
Ma Ri?

(Joo Hae Ra)

378
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:10,790
- Did something happen? - Ma Ri is gone.

379
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:14,115
I think she was abducted.

(President Kang In Wook)

381
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:25,165
Like you said,

382
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,395
I've lost everything. How do you feel?

383
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,365
Are you satisfied?

384
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,675
But Ma Ri...

385
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,415
Ma Ri...

386
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:44,815
will be with me...

387
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:47,485
until the day she dies.

388
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,755
Where are you?

389
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:55,000
Tell me!

(Mapo Police)

391
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:59,035
We are going to be together.

392
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:01,695
It might not be a bad idea...

393
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,165
to have you see us...

394
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:08,675

I...

398
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,635
knew...

399
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:25,475
that you would...

400
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:30,485
come back to me in the end.

401
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,585
Let's go together.

402
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,745
This gun...

403
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:05,245
will connect...

404
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,215
our hearts together.

405
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,625
It won't hurt at all.

406
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,925
We'll be...

407
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,025
happy forever.

408
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:35,575
Right.

409
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:39,585
This was...

410
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,255
our end.

411

Ma Ri.

412
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:03,365
Now I see.

413
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:08,735
Now that I'm blind,

414
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:10,845
I can see with my heart.

415
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:34,855

Ma Ri.

417

Ma Ri. Ma Ri.

418
00:43:07,702 --> 00:43:09,725
No!

419
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,890
Freeze! Drop it!

420
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:35,485
Drop it!

If I can be born again,

423

I want to be a man...

00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:53,705
who knows how to love.

Even then,

426

I'll love...

I'll love you,

428

in the world.

430
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,785
Ma Ri.

431
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:40,620
Call Doctor Han Jin Woo in.

432
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:43,060
- What? - Tell him it's Seo Jung Won.

433
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:44,855
- Okay. - You aren't allowed in here.

434
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:13,655
Doctor Seo.

435
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,685
What brings you here?

436
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:19,795
The bullet pierced her right rib.

437
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:22,355
Do you know her?

438
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:25,495
I'll go take a look at her first. Let's talk later.

439
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:29,965
I know it's hard,

440
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,075
but let me join the operation.

441
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:35,935
Please.

442
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:41,950
How is the patient's condition?

443
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,750
Her blood pressure is dropping below 60.

444
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:46,015
Keep the transfusion in check.

445
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,190
The bullet is stuck near the pulmonary artery.

446
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:50,155
It won't be easy to remove it.

447
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:26,055
It's here.

448
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:29,125
The bullet is slightly in the aorta.

449
00:46:29,336 --> 00:46:31,870
We have to be careful not to rip the blood vessel.

450
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,365
No.

451
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,200
That won't happen.

452
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,705
How are her vitals?

453
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,040
Stable so far.

454
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,005
Unable to cure the poison smeared in his soul,

455
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:44,305
he ended up giving up on his life.

456
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:46,575
And here,

457
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,985
this woman, who desperately wanted to survive,

458
00:46:50,257 --> 00:46:53,185
is holding onto her thin string of life.

460
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,525
Yes, doctor.

461
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:01,795
You must live.

462
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:04,795
Through the dark tunnel,

463
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:07,295
come to me.

464
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,135
You must...

465
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:14,235
come back to me.

466

You know the meaning of the gentian?

468
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:09,595
Your mother taught me when I visited her house the other day.

469
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:13,795
She loves this flower...

470
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,135
because of its deep meaning.

471
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,665
It's not hard to be together when you're happy.

472
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,080
You have to be able to embrace each other's sadness...

473
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,275
if you truly love the other.

474
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:37,730
The most splendid moment in your life...

475
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:40,655
is when you quietly share...

476
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,955
a warm gaze...

477
00:48:43,237 --> 00:48:45,065
