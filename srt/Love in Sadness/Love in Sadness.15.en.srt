1
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,345
The compass inside me...

2
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,645
keeps shaking.

3
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:23,570
That's because I could never be me.

4
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:24,970
(Calling: VVIP)

5
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,555
That's also because...

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,625
I never opened my eyes to love.

7
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:31,295
My world...

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,035
was in total darkness.

9
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,335
That was before...

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,520
love entered...

11
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:40,505
like a beam of light.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,875
In my world full of darkness,

13
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:48,915
he is...

14
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,285
the only one shining.

15
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:57,755
(Episode 29: Take Away My Fear)

16
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,965
Do you really think...

17
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,195
she'll come just like that?

18
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,265
She was determined to run away.

19
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:12,805
There are two types of people who run away.

20
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,105
Those who want to run away...

21
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,045
and those who want to get caught.

22
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,615
It really drives you crazy...

23
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:25,185
to chase after someone.

24
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,035
Is someone in there?

25
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,080
Vice-Director Joo.

26
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,650
I thought this place was empty because the lights were off.

27
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,235
Were you still here?

28
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,220
I was preparing for the exhibition.

29
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,120
All right, then.

30
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,375
Please lock the doors on your way out.

31
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:49,350
(Incoming: Joo Hae Ra)

32
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:52,535
Do you really think your wife...

33
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:55,305
will be coming to my office by 12am?

34
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,875
Ms. Yoon...

35
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,290
will run away even farther.

36
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:02,715
It's a pity how hard you tried to find her.

37
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:12,325
Had I been a bit smarter,

38
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,695
I would've found her sooner.

39
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:18,665
But every single time, I was duped.

40
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,265
First,

41
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,765
it was the purple dress...

42
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,035
that all 30 purchasers had.

43
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,305
Next...

44
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,605
was seeing Seo Jung Won's...

45
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,345
dead wife.

46
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,385
If...

47
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,725
Dr. Ha didn't make that slip of the tongue...

48
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,925
The fact that Ha Kyung died after...

49
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:50,525
staying a vegetable for five years...

50
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,795
If I didn't see...

51
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:55,335
Woo Ha Kyung's grave with my own eyes...

52
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,005
And if I didn't...

53
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,905
check the fingerprints...

54
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,075
of my wife with Woo Ha Kyung's,

55
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,675
I would've never believed it.

56
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,815
So...

57
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:11,400
are you saying that I'm the one...

58
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,600
who's responsible?

59
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:13,885
No.

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,235
It's you.

61
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:36,875
Seo Jung Won.

62
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,635
(Seo and Ha Plastic Surgery)

63
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:49,215
I've waited for so long.

64
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,465
I still love you so dearly.

65
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,445
I still can't believe it.

66
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,225
Woo Ha Kyung was...

67
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,045
She was...

68
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:13,765
the person I was looking for this whole time.

69
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:20,805
It's me.

70
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,075
Yoon Ma Ri.

71
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,175
How could you be my wife?

72
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:54,905
Ma Ri?

73
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,595
I'm glad you came back,

74
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,865
Ma Ri.

75
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,535
I...

76
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,805
no longer...

77
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,105
have Ma Ri's face.

78
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:31,945
It's okay.

79
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:33,975
It's all right.

80
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,315
I forgive you.

81
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:39,985
Let's go back...

82
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,485
to how things were.

83
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:45,225
Let's be happy...

84
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,355
like the first time we met.

85
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,465
Yes.

86
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:57,665
I can't go back.

87
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,705
Look at my face.

88
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,875
This is...

89
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,875
not the face of your wife whom you loved.

90
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:11,115
I had no choice.

91
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,785
This was the only way I could get away from you.

92
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,855
This face...

93
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:21,995
is worth nothing to you.

94
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:23,895
So...

95
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,295
let me go.

96
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,535
I said it's all right.

97
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,935
Better yet,

98
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:36,205
I can bring back the old face.

99
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,975
The face that I loved.

100
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:42,815
You won't be able to go anywhere.

101
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:46,185
Because if I can't have you,

102
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,885
I'll just end you.

103
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:53,625
This is me.

104
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,895
This is your husband...

105
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,865
who loves you so fervently.

106
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,465
You're...

107
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,220
insane.

108
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,535
Yes, I am.

109
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:11,345
Yes. Those eyes.

110
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:13,975
They never change.

111
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,015
Those were the eyes.

112
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,415
I already feel like we're back to how things were.

113
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:28,710
I can see hatred in your eyes.

114
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,225
No!

115
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,505
Ma Ri.

116
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:44,205
Jung Won is on his way here.

117
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,275
No, I can't put him in danger.

118
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,515
Please...

119
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,485
Please put that gun down!

120
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,220
Go! Get away from here!

121
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:16,105
Hurry! Get out of here!

122
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,705
Let me go!

123
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,315
Yoon Ma Ri!

124
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:52,845
Ma Ri.

125
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,535
Let me go! Let me go!

126
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,305
I said, let go!

127
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,905
Darn it.

128
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,495
Hae Ra.

129
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,565
Hae Ra. Hae Ra?

130
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:24,150
Hae Ra.

131
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:26,735
Hae Ra, open your eyes. Hae Ra!

132
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,335
Honey.

133
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,360
Let's go. We'll be late.

134
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,115
We're running late.

135
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,915
- You look great together. - Thank you.

136
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,200
I hope you have a happy life with your family as well.

137
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,055
Do you want to know the truth?

138
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:54,155
You're a filthy dirtbag who abuses a weak woman. That's the truth.

139
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,005
Where are we going?

140
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,175
Home.

141
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,845
I'd like to go home...

142
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:18,115
and celebrate your return.

143
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:27,925
But there's something I need to do,

144
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,495
Ma Ri.

145
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,015
Would you like a drink?

146
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,525
Do you think this villa will be safe?

147
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,065
Everyone will know by the weekend.

148
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,735
What will your father say...

149
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,120
when he sees my face?

150
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,105
I should wrap things up before then.

151
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,175
It won't take long.

152
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:00,985
Will you please let me go...

153
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,755
and live a better life for yourself?

154
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,125
I beg you.

155
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,195
Please let me go.

156
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:11,865
You know what?

157
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:14,495
I'm going to do my best...

158
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,935
to forgive you.

159
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,535
"It was nothing."

160
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,205
"What matters is..."

161
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,275
"that she came back to me."

162
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:27,945
I know I can love you like I used to...

163
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:30,615
and live happily.

164
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,455
Let's...

165
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,855
have a child as well.

166
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:41,525
If we have a child who looks like us,

167
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,295
our bond will become even stronger.

168
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,695
No.

169
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,805
You can't put me in a cage forever.

170
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,705
That's because I know the last resort...

171
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,845
in order to break free from you.

172
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,315
Your mother...

173
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,185
taught me.

174
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,985
If I no longer exists,

175
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,625
everything will be over.

176
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,825
I have nothing to fear.

177
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,565
So...

178
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,365
if you don't want to lose me forever,

179
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,565
let me go.

180
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,215
Seo Jung Won.

181
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:41,315
He's the one who needs to die.

182
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,855
Not you.

183
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,310
I can forgive you because you're my wife.

184
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,195
But not him.

185
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,380
No.

186
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,565
He enticed someone's else's wife...

187
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,465
and gave his dead wife's face to her.

188
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,635
On top of that,

189
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,905
they lived like a married couple.

190
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,675
He needs to atone for his sins.

191
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:07,945
No!

192
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,285
So live.

193
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,155
You need to witness his ruin...

194
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:19,340
and how he will suffer in my hands.

195
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,455
He did nothing wrong.

196
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,410
I begged him.

197
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,010
I begged him to change my face so that I could be free.

198
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,295
Why?

199
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,535
Why do you look so afraid?

200
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,535
Is his being ruined...

201
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,975
such a frightening thing for you?

202
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,590
I'll listen to everything you say.

203
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,430
So please don't harm him!

204
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,415
- Please! - Stop.

205
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:46,385
Stop!

206
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:48,185
Stop crying.

207
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,685
Okay?

208
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,225
Whom are you crying for?

209
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:56,625
Never cry...

210
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,565
for some other man in front of me again.

211
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:03,565
It makes my blood boil.

212
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:23,455
Open this door, In Wook.

213
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:25,725
Open this door.

214
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,625
Please open this door!

215
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,425
In Wook!

216
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,895
If anyone's there, please help!

217
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,625
Are you awake?

218
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:15,950
Thankfully, you didn't get hurt too badly.

219
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,835
You just passed out.

220
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:19,920
Where's Ma Ri?

221
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,975
You were the only one there.

222
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,090
Did he take her?

223
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,375
Yes.

224
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,545
He knew everything.

225
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:33,115
He said he finished putting the puzzle together.

226
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,785
Lie down for now. You need to rest.

227
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:40,625
Let me know if Kang In Wook calls again.

228
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:43,095
Are you going after him?

229
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:46,410
Don't do that. Just call the police.

230
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:48,665
All that he did was bring his wife home.

231
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:51,535
I have no right.

232
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:55,275
- The police won't help. - That man...

233
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:57,920
is more frightening than we thought.

234
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,875
That's more the reason why I should save her.

235
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,445
I can't let her near him anymore.

236
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:05,685
He has a gun.

237
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,055
Now that he's found his wife,

238
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:14,555
what do you think he'll do next?

239
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:17,695
Do you think you'll be safe after changing her face?

240
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,095
So please don't confront him, okay?

241
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,435
Just imagining the situation she must be in right now...

242
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,975
suffocates me.

243
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:47,240
Did you look into the doctors?

244
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:49,995
They all refused, saying that such a surgery is too dangerous.

245
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,565
Sung Wook.

246
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:56,535
What do you think my father will say when he finds out?

247
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,550
Don't ask a bunch of scaredy-cats who call themselves doctors.

248
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,190
Look for a true surgeon!

249
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,490
Yes, sir.

250
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,075
Be quick.

251
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:08,445
We're running out of time.

252
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:14,715
And sir, Chairman Kang convoked a meeting of the directorate.

253
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:18,585
Why?

254
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,755
I'm not certain, sir.

255
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,705
I've called for an extraordinary meeting of the directorate.

256
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,975
We'll be discussing the dismissal of President Kang In Wook.

257
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,975
If only raising a son...

258
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:47,015
was as perfect and easy as trimming this bonsai tree...

259
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:48,885
I'm sure it was difficult, sir.

260
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,900
After Ms. Yoon's disappearance,

261
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,870
he seemed unstable.

262
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,525
But most of all, he couldn't focus on the company.

263
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,595
About Ma Ri...

264
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,165
I've always disliked her.

265
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:04,165
He stood in your son's way.

266
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,820
And since then,

267
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:10,475
he started to disappoint you.

268
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:13,375
Don't you dare judge him.

269
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:17,045
He's my son.

270
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,085
I'm sorry.

271
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:24,255
I found...

272
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:25,725
Ma Ri.

273
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,155
She got into an accident while on her trip...

274
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:29,840
and was being treated.

275
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,895
I only found out now,

276
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,365
so I couldn't tell you sooner.

277
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,650
- An accident? - I'll bring her back...

278
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:37,780
as soon as she's all healed.

279
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,135
Where...

280
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,805
and how is she being treated?

281
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:46,445
Father. You don't have to worry about that.

282
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,115
Perhaps, it's because I haven't seen her in a long time,

283
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:53,015
but I miss her.

284
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,585
I'll bring her with me soon.

285
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,465
What a weak punk.

286
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:12,305
He glared at me the same way his mother did.

287
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,505
They have no idea...

288
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:18,575
how much it torments me.

289
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:26,785
Ma Ri.

290
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:30,855
I'll protect you.

291
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,455
I won't lose you...

292
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:38,965
like I did with my mom.

293
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,715
(Episode 30)

294
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:08,995
I brought sushi.

295
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,995
Your favorite.

296
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,315
You don't know...

297
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:32,045
how glad I am...

298
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:35,415
to have found you.

299
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:38,525
Don't do anything...

300
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,185
to Dr. Seo.

301
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,225
I really meant what I said.

302
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,095
Your reaction is too cruel.

303
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:51,635
Ma Ri,

304
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,605
do you really...

305
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,345
want to protect him that badly?

306
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:02,945
That's too bad.

307
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,160
Revenge must be taken place.

308
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:09,155
My father taught me that as he beat me up.

309
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,455
You are...

310
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,025
just like your father.

311
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,080
How are you any different...

312
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,065
from your father who made your mother die?

313
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,035
There she is.

314
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,035
This is exactly what I wanted.

315
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:28,620
You clearly are Ma Ri.

316
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,575
You must be my Ma Ri.

317
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:34,505
I was worried if you weren't Ma Ri.

318
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,575
I was worried if this was all just a dream.

319
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,815
What if...

320
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,215
Ma Ri disappears again?

321
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,885
I've been worried.

322
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:47,885
Ma Ri.

323
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:52,195
I thought you were gone.

324
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,835
Do you know how hard it was for me?

325
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,275
I thought I was going insane.

326
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,205
It's okay.

327
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,845
It's okay.

328
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:12,785
You...

329
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,485
will be back...

330
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,385
to my lovely Ma Ri.

331
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,585
And you will be beside me,

332
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:25,825
watching Seo Jung Won die slowly in pain.

333
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,165
Don't you agree?

334
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:30,065
I told you...

335
00:29:30,152 --> 00:29:32,835
that Dr. Seo has nothing to do with this.

336
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:34,890
This is our problem.

337
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,305
Let's keep this between us.

338
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,815
Between us.

339
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:48,585
Us.

340
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,255
I like that word.

341
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:53,855
Get some rest.

342
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,300
I've been searching domestically and internationally,

343
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,955
but it seems difficult to find a plastic surgeon for the job.

344
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,165
It's me.

345
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:11,735
You can't.

346
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,920
You don't have the option to say that you can't.

347
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,975
The only person who can do this surgery...

348
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,305
is Dr. Seo.

349
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,515
I told you to do it.

350
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:30,855
I told you to do the surgery. You.

351
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:33,685
Nobody including myself is capable of the surgery.

352
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,870
Only Dr. Seo can do it.

353
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,025
He perfectly reconstructed Ha Kyung's face...

354
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:40,065
that was unrecognizable after the accident.

355
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,335
This surgery is impossible...

356
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,905
if it's not Dr. Seo.

357
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,585
I'm here to see President Kang.

358
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,310
Do you have an appointment?

359
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:11,525
He'll know if you say Seo Jung Won is here.

360
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,340
I'm sorry, but if you don't have an appointment,

361
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,095
you can't see him.

362
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:26,475
Excuse me! Where are you going?

363
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:33,915
- I'm here to see President Kang. - You need to follow the procedure.

364
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:39,585
I have to see President Kang.

365
00:32:40,342 --> 00:32:41,825
Let go!

366
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,235
Why are you here?

367
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,375
Where is Ma Ri?

368
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:02,890
I used to ask you that.

369
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,315
It sounds odd hearing it from you.

370
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,370
Why do you ask? You're not her husband.

371
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,455
Tell me where Ma Ri is.

372
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:12,625
However,

373
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:15,325
I'm a generous man. Okay.

374
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,425
I can let you meet her.

375
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,435
Follow me...

376
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,765
if you dare.

377
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,445
Bring him.

378
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:45,555
Should I find out what's going on?

379
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,375
President Kang wants you to come.

380
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:53,625
(Temporarily Closed)

381
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,710
As you ordered, everything is prepared.

382
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,865
The surgery can start right away.

383
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:29,930
Where are we?

384
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,325
I told you I'll let you meet Ma Ri.

385
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,755
Ma Ri.

386
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:08,895
Are you okay?

387
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:18,535
You're okay, right?

388
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,605
Don't do that.

389
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,675
It certainly is unpleasant to see this.

390
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,360
I told you.

391
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:36,555
He only did the surgery because I begged him to.

392
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,585
I'm okay.

393
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,655
Don't worry.

394
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,240
Send Ma Ri outside.

395
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,110
Let's talk in private.

396
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:50,665
You can't get anything done in this way.

397
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:54,965
Our ways are different.

398
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:57,990
Unfortunately, I'm going to get things done...

399
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,475
in my way.

400
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:02,615
Please.

401
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:05,090
Please leave him out of this.

402
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:08,800
Everything happened all because I ran away.

403
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:10,115
Stop!

404
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:11,855
Stop it.

405
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,485
Stop. I'm a husband...

406
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,355
who desperately looked after his wife.

407
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,110
You are...

408
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:23,535
a man who had an affair with my wife. And you...

409
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,120
are just a wife who cheated on me with another man.

410
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,190
Regardless of that,

411
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,775
I love my wife...

412
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:33,875
so much.

413
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,230
Which is why I'm trying to straighten things out this way.

414
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,885
You're a husband who hit and confined his wife.

415
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:43,070
Ma Ri was a wife who ran away to survive.

416
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,555
Be quiet.

417
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,825
There's only one way you can make an apology.

418
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:50,895
Change Ma Ri's face...

419
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,065
back to the way it was.

420
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:01,005
To my beloved wife's face.

421
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,490
What are you talking about?

422
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:08,775
If you don't do the surgery within today,

423
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:10,315
you...

424
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:13,285
won't be able to make it outside alive.

425
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:17,630
No. You can't.

426
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:19,170
Please don't do that.

427
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:22,825
Everything's prepared in the Operating Room.

428
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,525
Let's go inside.

429
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:31,535
You call that love?

430
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,605
It's just an unhealthy obsession.

431
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,675
"Obsession"?

432
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:42,845
If I'm obsessed,

433
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:44,975
what does that make you?

434
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,515
Look at Ma Ri's face.

435
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:51,800
Who do you see?

436
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,155
With your eyes,

437
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:56,025
who do you see?

438
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,725
Seo Jung Won,

439
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,525
tell me who you see!

440
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:07,335
If Dr. Seo gets hurt, there will be problems for the surgery.

441
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:16,945
I can't do the surgery.

442
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:19,300
You can't?

443
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,515
I can never allow you that as a doctor.

444
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:23,530
Another surgery will put Ma Ri to danger.

445
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:25,055
So you're saying...

446
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,425
that you can't do it...

447
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:31,295
even if you die.

448
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,865
I can't.

449
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,705
What if...

450
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,335
both of you die?

451
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:53,585
I'll give you time to think it through.

452
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:03,055
The choice is yours.

453
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:06,995
Whether you want to die...

454
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:08,625
or do the surgery.

455
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:41,180
- Where's Dr. Seo and Dr. Ha? - They're both not here.

456
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:43,695
Each separately went out in a hurry.

457
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:46,865
(Call History, Seo Jung Won)

458
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,575
Have you seen Dr. Seo?

459
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,145
Do you know where he went?

460
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,715
I don't know where he is,

461
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:06,625
but I think I know who he's with.

462
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:12,125
I introduced him...

463
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,195
to Kang In Wook.

464
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:18,065
I told him if he's looking for an expertise in reconstruction surgery,

465
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:20,135
he should go to Seo Jung Won.

466
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:23,775
Hae Ra,

467
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,375
Kang In Wook...

468
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:29,615
is really evil.

469
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,245
I think he's going to make...

470
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,985
all three of us suffer.

471
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:48,595
Dr. Ha! Seong Ho!

472
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,955
Do...

473
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,495
the surgery.

474
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:20,725
It's dangerous.

475
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:24,535
I can't do it.

476
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:27,505
Change my face...

477
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,175
to what it looked like before.

478
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:35,345
I'm okay.

479
00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:37,645
Please.

480
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:48,585
Do you know the legend about the winter rose that blooms through ice?

481
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:52,285
The poor shepherd...

482
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,355
was crying because he had nothing to give to the heavens.

483
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,895
An angel appeared...

484
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,195
and created a rose.

485
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,535
Even from the freezing ground,

486
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,765
a flower still blooms.

487
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:09,205
Never be frustrated.

488
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:12,205
A flower still blooms...

489
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,305
through the ice.

490
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,915
Stay hopeful.

491
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:23,915
There must be a way.

492
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,785
I've always made...

493
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:29,725
wrong decisions throughout life.

494
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:32,625
I might make...

495
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:36,735
another stupid decision.

496
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:44,035
You won't.

497
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,075
You're different from the past.

498
00:46:16,323 --> 00:46:17,975
You didn't even begin.

499
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,285
Let go of Ma Ri...

500
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:30,830
if you have enough discernment.

501
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:33,670
I told you to make her face hers again.

502
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:35,370
I can't give permission to that as a doctor.

503
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,895
As a doctor,

504
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:40,125
I will make you hit rock bottom. Can't you recall...

505
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:42,565
the amount of effort you have put in until now?

506
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:44,810
You will see everything collapse at once.

507
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:46,365
Stop it!

508
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:51,375
Dr. Seo...

509
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:54,205
will not change my face.

510
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:57,175
Because this face...

511
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,415
belongs to his beloved wife.

512
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,485
He'll be sad if it disappears.

513
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,395
I...

514
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:13,765
don't like this face.

515
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:16,450
I never wanted this face.

516
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,735
So, please...

517
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:20,065
find another doctor.

518
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:31,015
I will.

519
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:34,445
Even if it requires me to search all over the world.

520
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,515
Okay.

521
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:40,385
You won...

522
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:42,685
as always.

523
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:46,795
And it's time for me to return.

524
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,465
Ma Ri.

525
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,235
You're overly obsessed with me.

526
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:57,875
And I'm so weak...

527
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,945
that I can't survive without depending on someone.

528
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:03,375
We are...

529
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:06,615
one perfect couple.

530
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:13,485
We can go back to how we were.

531
00:48:13,908 --> 00:48:16,555
I can become the wife you want me to be.

532
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,965
The wife who always waits for you...

533
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:24,295
like a flower in a vase.

534
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:39,645
Ma Ri. Ma Ri.

535
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,945
You don't have to do that. Ma Ri!

536
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:44,115
Don't do that. Ma Ri!

537
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:46,115
Ma Ri!

538
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,255
Ma Ri! Don't make the wrong decision!

539
00:48:50,077 --> 00:48:53,625
Ma Ri! Let go. Let go!

540
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:55,895
Let go!

541
00:48:56,817 --> 00:48:58,395
Ma Ri!

542
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,375
I'm sorry.

543
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,505
I'm sorry.

544
00:49:07,428 --> 00:49:09,075
I'm truly sorry.

545
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:27,995
I'm okay.

546
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,265
Don't lose hope.

547
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:35,035
Bloom through the frozen ground.

548
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,635
Like a beautiful winter rose.

549
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:55,270
Take Away My Fear.

550
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:57,055
(Take Away My Fear.)
