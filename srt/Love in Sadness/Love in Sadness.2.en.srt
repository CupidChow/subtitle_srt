1
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,675
Let's go home.

2
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,485
To our place.

00:00:55,572 --> 00:01:02,235
(Episode 3: You Are My Hope)

4
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,270
(We should have the dinner we missed last night. I'll send a car.)

5
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,440
We should have the dinner...

6
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:41,515
we missed last night. I'll send a car.

7
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:15,015
Do you know how beautiful your neck is?

8
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:45,475
Let's go home. To our place.

9
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,185
(Operation Room, Restricted Area)

10
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:06,955
(It'd look good with your long hair. I want to see it at dinner.)

11
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,925
It'd look good with your long hair.

12
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,365
I want to see it at dinner.

13
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,030
I'd like further information about the research.

14
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,995
Please email me.

15
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:09,285
This is the 2004 Bordeaux you asked for.

16
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,300
What?

17
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:24,740
I can't find your wife.

18
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,575
And I can't reach her.

19
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,975
Send me the CCTV footage now.

20
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:21,160
Doctor Seo. Let's have dinner together.

21
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,360
Right. It's raining today. Let's have dinner together.

22
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,600
Let's do that.

23
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,660
I have an operation to perform after dinner.

24
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,395
Come with us.

25
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,640
There's no one in your house.

26
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,310
Why do you rush home every day?

27
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,940
I know.

28
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,775
Let's just go without him.

29
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,245
Enjoy your dinner.

30
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,965
Doctor.

31
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,175
Excuse me. Are you all right?

32
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,555
President Kang.

33
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,400
We have to find her.

34
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,870
What are you doing?

35
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,505
Yes, sir.

36
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:05,785
I'll get you a change of clothes.

37
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,655
It's my wife's. I think it will fit.

38
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,190
Is it about something that you couldn't tell me...

39
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,960
during the consultation the other day?

40
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,555
If you're being chased by someone bad,

41
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,925
I'll call the police.

42
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,315
Put your clothes on.

43
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,145
Please help me.

44
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,045
I just can't live...

45
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,675
with this face.

46
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:12,315
Please change my face.

47
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,625
I want to live.

48
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,545
He...

49
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,715
was a good guy at first.

50
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,315
I even thought...

51
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:57,725
I wanted to leave my life to him.

52
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:02,095
I met him for the first time during my graduation exhibition.

53
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,965
I found out later...

54
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,265
that my face...

55
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,295
in my painting...

56
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:47,775
looked like his mother.

57
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,155
It's not...

58
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,955
that he wants me.

59
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:09,655
He only wants to see me looking like his mother.

60
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,625
So...

61
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,695
he never hits my face.

62
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,365
It's his precious thing...

63
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,635
that shouldn't be ruined.

64
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,215
My misery...

65
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:33,145
started with my face.

66
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,925
Changing your face...

67
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,965
can't be a fundamental solution.

68
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:50,535
Call the police...

69
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,270
to be protected by law.

70
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,575
I've tried everything I could.

71
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,805
But...

72
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,510
I ended up getting captured again every time.

73
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,945
He doesn't even care...

74
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,785
if it's legal or illegal.

75
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,190
There must be a way out.

76
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,885
A way?

77
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,785
There's no such thing.

78
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,795
Except one.

79
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,435
I...

80
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,165
can't perform...

81
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:28,705
a surgery like that.

82
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:33,875
Have you...

83
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,585
ever done anything you regretted?

84
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,785
Why?

85
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:50,490
What's so surprising? The ring?

86
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:51,630
Or marriage?

87
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:54,300
They both are surprising.

88
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,770
It's been less than a month since we met.

89
00:15:56,772 --> 00:16:00,605
And you're asking me to marry you with a ring?

90
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:12,985
Watch carefully. This is my first and last time...

91
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:15,485
to get down on my knees.

92
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,225
What are you doing?

93
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:22,730
A month from now, on Sunday,

94
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,125
at this very hotel, we are getting married.

95
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:30,230
There will be an open exhibition in a month.

96
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,365
- I need to prepare... - From the moment I met you,

97
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:36,875
I've wanted to marry you.

98
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,645
I knew at first sight.

99
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,645
That this ring...

100
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,645
belongs to you.

101
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,685
My mother...

102
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,015
used to wear this ring.

103
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,855
Please take it.

104
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,995
Why me?

105
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:03,095
There are a lot of women who suit you better.

106
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,305
Those women...

107
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,235
aren't you.

108
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,105
I need you.

109
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,945
I can't get married now.

110
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:14,780
My mother is sick, and...

111
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,615
About your mother.

112
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,985
Let's get married first.

113
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,450
Alcoholic dementia can't be treated at home.

114
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,990
We will take her to the sanatorium that my company supports.

115
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,925
I already took care of the admission process.

116
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:31,800
Do you know my mother?

117
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,425
Do you think...

118
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:36,535
I don't know anything about you?

119
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:03,325
Countless times,

120
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:08,735
I've wanted to go back in time and stop myself.

121
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,505
That's how I feel.

122
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,745
We're finding out her whereabouts checking the CCTVs in the vicinity.

123
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,285
(No signal)

124
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,725
I'll be late.

125
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,555
- I'll do it in my way. - Yes, sir.

126
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:51,105
I want to go back to before I was married.

127
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:54,775
I was too young...

128
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:59,285
to know what love is. So I want to go back...

129
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:03,185
and turn myself around.

130
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:08,155
All the laughter and joy...

131
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,295
of that time...

132
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,965
is what I want back.

133
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,670
So...

134
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:24,705
please change my face so he can't recognize me.

135
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,575
Otherwise,

136
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,675
I'll kill myself.

137
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:33,515
There's no other choice.

138
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,160
I'm asking you...

139
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:43,455
to save my life now.

140
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:40,720
Jung Won.

141
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,515
Seo Jung Won.

142
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,060
Why aren't you answering my calls?

143
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,130
Well... I had something to do.

144
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,160
Hurry. We have to go to the hospital.

145
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,830
- Why? - Doctor Ha ran into...

146
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,300
a problem during surgery.

147
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,070
It's an emergency, but he couldn't reach you.

148
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:58,640
And there's no one else to help him.

149
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:01,040
It was so urgent that he even called me.

150
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,340
Okay. I'll be right there.

151
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,375
- I'll drive you there. - Go first. I'll be right there.

152
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,115
Something came up at the hospital, so I have to go.

153
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,555
Let's talk when I get back.

154
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,980
I clearly warned you before.

155
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,720
If you pushed ahead with the surgery,

156
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:22,050
you'd get yourself in trouble.

157
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:24,220
I told her the surgery was too risky to perform,

158
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,360
but she kept insisting. What was I supposed to do?

159
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:29,325
Everyone, focus on the surgery.

160
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:22,875
Ma Ri.

161
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:25,045
Remember this.

162
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,115
No matter how hard you try to run away,

163
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,085
your mother whom you love the most in this world...

164
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:34,855
is with me.

165
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,365
No.

166
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,285
GH Sanitarium

167
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,420
This is Yoon Ma Ri. Is my mother doing okay?

168
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,560
Madam, I've been trying to reach you.

169
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,290
But your phone was turned off.

170
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,930
Why? Is something wrong with my mother?

171
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:14,260
She's getting worse all of a sudden.

172
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,095
You need to come over here quickly.

173
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:18,035
Okay.

174
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,405
Well done.

175

(GH Sanatorium)

176
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:43,190
Mom, what's wrong?

177
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,755
Are you all right?

178
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,625
Yes.

179
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,085
You're here.

180
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:21,055
Hello.

181
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:33,940
I knew Doctor Ha would get in trouble like that someday.

182
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:37,270
He just performs all the surgeries without saying no.

183
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,840
But Doctor Seo took care of it.

184
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,580
And I helped him with that.

185
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,050
I'm not sure...

186
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,485
if you were really helpful.

187
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:49,850
She could've just said that she likes me.

188
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,615
Doctor Seo.

189
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:54,290
Why did you come so early?

190
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:57,130
You performed a difficult surgery all night. You need some sleep.

191
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:58,500
How is the patient doing?

192
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,965
Her vital signs are stable.

193
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,430
Here's the chart.

194
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:14,605
(Episode 4)

195
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,185
It's like you've changed into a different person overnight.

196
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:21,385
It's quite awkward.

197
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,360
Let's go now.

198
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,255
We don't want to worry your mother.

199
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:34,725
Now.

200
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:15,005
We'll let you rest.

201
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,090
She asked you to change her entire face...

202
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:34,225
because of family violence?

203
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,295
Why?

204
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:39,060
To run away...

205
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:41,025
with a new face?

206
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,870
She's dangerous.

207
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,740
What can I do to help?

208
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:49,410
What do you mean?

209
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:52,040
You're not someone to get involved with that.

210
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,880
What if you get entangled in their problem?

211
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:55,845
She has such a beautiful face.

212
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:59,345
It'd be a waste to ruin her face with plastic surgery.

213
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:03,655
But she mentioned her face brought her misfortunes.

214
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,785
That's what bothers me.

215
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:09,930
Changing her face won't solve the problem.

216
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,460
Her name, social security number, and everything will stay the same.

217
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:16,135
Her husband can easily find her.

218
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:19,640
Later, she could ask you...

219
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:22,675
for illegal deeds like fabricating a fake identity.

220
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:24,510
Let her find a specialized attorney...

221
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,140
and take legal actions to settle the issue.

222
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,305
Do you want me to search for a skilled attorney?

223
00:29:58,246 --> 00:29:59,845
Get out.

224
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:09,355
You are...

225
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:12,625
different from my mother? That's not true.

226
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,425
You're the same.

227
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:16,955
You only think about running away.

228
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,025
You make me...

229
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,735
anxious all the time.

230
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,705
What's wrong with...

231
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,675
being greedy over you and holding onto my love?

232
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,475
That's how everyone lives.

233
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,875
That's how everyone lives?

234
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:42,815
They trample on the other with their power?

235
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,625
And use the other's family...

236
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:47,485
to set a trap?

237
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,395
No.

238
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,825
Others...

239
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,500
sacrifice...

240
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:56,930
and give up on what they have for the other.

241
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,035
They cherish and adore the other's family.

242
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,335
That's how they live!

243
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,845
Fine.

244
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:09,615
Let's say my heart for you...

245
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,445
is greed.

246
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:15,715
Then what is yours?

247
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,225
What is it?

248
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,965
Can't you...

249
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,170
live the way I want...

250
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,035
for my sake...

251
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,965
at least for a while?

252
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,305
You're like a ticking time bomb.

253
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:42,615
Do you want me to live next to you in fear?

254
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:47,385
Do you want to know my feelings towards you?

255
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:50,255
I'm scared...

256
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:52,590
and frightened.

257
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:54,725
You scare me.

258
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,865
Let's please end it here.

259
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,735
It's...

260
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:08,875
already over between us.

00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:13,565
Please change my face.

265
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,175
Is she all right?

266
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,125
You...

267
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:19,035
have such dangerous eyes.

268
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,475
Below the veil of innocence...

269
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,705
lies full of fear.

270
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:27,905
And betrayal,

271
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:32,845
which drives me crazy.

272
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,315
Your eyes tell me...

273
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,525
that you'll dump me and run away one day.

274
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:03,335
It's my wedding anniversary gift to you.

275
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:09,875
It's pretty.

276
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,880
Your taste never changes.

277
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:15,220
You shouldn't mock my taste...

278
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,355
when I chose you.

279
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:35,505
How long will your business trip take this time?

280
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,275
A week.

281
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,445
That's so long.

282
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:44,115
That's the client's schedule, so what can I do about it?

283
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:58,595
Oh, dear. I need to get going now.

284
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,000
But you still have time left before the flight.

285
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,865
I think they got the wrong time.

286
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:09,840
- We need to talk. - Sorry, let's talk later.

287
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:11,975
I better hurry.

288
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:14,440
Eat before you go.

289
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,550
- I'll drive you there. - I drove here.

290

I'll drive you. Let's talk on our way there.

291
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,255
I said I want to go alone.

292
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:27,825
It's more comfortable that way.

293
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,425
Wait.

294
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:48,705
What's wrong?

295
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:52,415
It's just...

296
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,685
that I have a strange feeling.

297
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,585

She's my wife. I'll operate on her.

I'll do it.

It might take about a week.

I've never traveled this far ever since you fell into a coma,

321
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:01,325
but I can't miss this one.

322

It's fine.

325
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,985
I'll be looking at the paintings, so don't mind me.

326
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:21,500
I was happy that I discovered one nice artist,

327

but I'm doomed.

328

What?

329
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:27,440
She's unable to continue her career due to personal reasons.

330
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:31,015
That leaves the first place winner vacant.

331
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,685
I'd like to return the painting, but she's out of touch.

332
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,785
What brings you here at this hour?

Okay, okay.

00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:12,290
That victim of family violence?

343
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,620
If she visits my hospital while I'm away,

344
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,990
can you see her on my behalf?

345
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,555
I told the reception to contact you.

346
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,700
She might try to call my cellphone number,

347
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:23,000
so I'll forward it to your number.

348
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:25,630
What do you want me to do?

349
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,140
Do what you can if she needs legal help.

350
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,770
If she needs protection,

351
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:33,340
let her stay at my house for the time being.

352
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:35,280
Isn't that a little too much?

353
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:38,250
Even your house? How do you believe her?

354
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:39,915
Thanks in advance.

355
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:24,395
You're useful here.

356
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:28,500
I heard you ordered Director Choi to get a pistol.

357
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,370
- That's right. - Good.

358
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,240
Every man wishes to pull the real trigger.

359
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,270
He brought it to me, so I checked it one more time.

360
00:46:36,277 --> 00:46:38,775
It looked nice.

361
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,545
The world is a war zone.

362
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,345
You must blow the other's head off first if you don't want to die.

363
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:54,155
I raised you to be strong.

364
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:57,225
So that you won't step a single step back.

365
00:46:57,264 --> 00:46:59,725
So that no one can betray you.

366
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,870
If anyone tries to betray you,

367
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,570
teach them a lesson.

368
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,570
"How dare you do that to me?"

369
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,740
"How dare you try to betray me?"

370
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,075
Show them your power.

371
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,820
You're indeed my son.

372
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,485
You take after me.

373
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:01,925
"The fairy of the forest falls deeply in pain..."

374
00:48:02,263 --> 00:48:04,430
"and begs the deity..."

375
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:06,495
"to turn her into a flower."

376
00:48:09,236 --> 00:48:10,935
"The next day,"

377
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,405
"she blooms as a daisy."

378
00:48:18,078 --> 00:48:21,175
"Her beautiful face, which put her into the bottom of a pit,"

379
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:25,015
"blooms as a dangerous flower like death."

380
00:48:28,923 --> 00:48:32,155
What do you think? Do you like it?

381
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,185
This is a special gift for you. It arrived today.

382
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:38,655
Don't worry.

383
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,425
I haven't loaded it yet.

384
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:50,675
You were always curious...

385
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:55,045
how my mother passed away.

386
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,550
Like you,

387
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:00,745
my mother ran away countless times.

388
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:03,320
And my father caught her...

389
00:49:03,324 --> 00:49:05,055
countless times.

390
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:08,625
It was repeated countless times.

391
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:12,555
She ran away and got caught.

392
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:15,665
She ran away and got caught again.

393
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,495
In the end,

394
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,175
she passed away.

395
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,475
Mom.

396
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,425
Mom...

397
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,235
Mom...

398
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,115
Bang.

399
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:14,155
That's how she succeeded in escaping.

400
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:19,395
She ran away to somewhere completely out of my father's reach.

401
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,630
After her funeral,

402
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:24,665
I asked him...

403
00:50:24,738 --> 00:50:27,205
why he let her die that way.

404
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:30,275
Why he didn't let her go.

405
00:50:30,911 --> 00:50:33,505
Why he clung onto her.

406
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:35,905
Why?

407
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,385
He said, "Because she's mine."

408
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:47,125
"Because she's mine."

409
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:50,295
What on earth?

410
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:54,365
But you know what's funny?

411
00:50:55,002 --> 00:50:57,235
After I met you,

412
00:50:58,272 --> 00:51:00,605
I came to understand him.

413
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:10,445
You've never done this before, have you?

414
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:13,815
Point the gun at the target.

415
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:17,785
And pull the trigger. You know how that feels?

416
00:51:22,563 --> 00:51:24,155
Here.

417
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,205
You wouldn't know.

418
00:51:36,543 --> 00:51:39,510
You see, when it comes to shooting,

419
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,845
I'm not interested in fixed targets. You know why?

420
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,710
Because there's no point in shooting.

421
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:47,885
But once the target...

422
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:50,985
starts to fly into the air,

423
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,725
I go crazy.

424
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,585
I can't watch it fly away like that.

425
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:00,565
Then...

426
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,625
I don't hesitate.

427
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:06,235
Daisy means,

428
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:09,570
"You are my hope."

429
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:11,175
Bang!

430
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:14,775
However,

431
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:18,175
my desperate signal for help through this flower...

432
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:20,315
isn't getting anywhere.

433
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:24,750
There's nowhere for my signal...

434
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,955
to go.

435
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,530
You're my hope.

436
00:52:31,532 --> 00:52:33,425
("Daisy", You're my hope.)

437
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,010
(Love in Sadness)

438
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:47,780
I'll do everything I can.

439
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:50,680
I don't want to regret not doing anything.

440
00:52:50,684 --> 00:52:53,550
Bye, Yoon Ma Ri.

441
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:56,020
You can't disappear, Ma Ri.

442
00:52:56,023 --> 00:52:58,690
Because I'll find you no matter what.

443
00:52:58,692 --> 00:52:59,960
Ha Kyung?

444
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
Who's that woman?

445
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:03,230
The woman with Ha Kyung's face. Who is she?

446
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,295
I think I know...

447
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,800
whom I look like.

448
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:09,570
Where's your wife?

449
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,670
Why are you looking for my wife?

450
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:14,905
Ma Ri! Yoon Ma Ri!
