1
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:26,965
Do I look...

2
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:30,065
very similar to your wife?

3
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,575
Your face, yes.

4
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:38,475
But you two are completely different individuals.

5
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:43,785
I actually hoped that we'd be exactly the same.

6
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:49,055
My dad passed away when I was little.

7
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:54,425
And my mom would cry in front of me and say that...

8
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,900
she'd wish the skies...

9
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:00,995
would answer her prayer and bring my dad back.

10
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:03,810
Even if it was for a few hours,

11
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,805
she wanted to see him once again.

12
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,545
I have nothing...

13
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:15,415
I can do for you.

14
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:20,285
But since you said that I looked very similar to your wife,

15
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,085
I hoped that...

16
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:25,485
this would seem like a gift from above...

17
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,225
to you.

18
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:35,235
I'll be like your acting wife.

19
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,935
Just imagine that you've borrowed me for a while.

20
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:43,235
We can eat dinner together and have some wine.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,120
We can plan out our holiday.

22
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,715
We can talk about our later years.

23
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,075
Well...

24
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,985
Something like that.

25
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,625
I know it sounds ridiculous.

26
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,185
But...

27
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:02,425
I just wanted to help in any way possible.

28
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,685
This is the last house.

29
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,795
What's the matter?

30
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,235
Is Ms. Woo Ha Kyung inside?

31
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:47,575
Why are you looking for my wife?

32
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,950
We need to check if she has this dress or not.

33
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,915
Excuse me.

34
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,160
It's a missing persons case, so please cooperate with us.

35
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,400
Let me see a warrant.

36
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,825
I will...

37
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,125
compensate you handsomely.

38
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,195
So please allow me to check.

39
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,075
I guess you two were dining.

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,755
But...

41
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,885
where is she?

42
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:50,635
(Episode 9: Fear Comes for Me)

43
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,845
What are you doing?

44
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,730
Please leave.

45
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:50,155
I think...

46
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,525
his wife is taking a shower.

47
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:16,485
It has been confirmed that your wife had purchased this dress.

48
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,825
Could you show it to me?

49
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,655
Here.

50
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:40,750
(Customer List of Purchase)

51
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,835
(Joo Hae Ra, Woo Ha Kyung)

52
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:47,345
I guess you're looking for everyone who has purchased this dress.

53
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:49,575
It seems like there's one person left.

54
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,645
Thank you for your cooperation.

55
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,615
Please return my dress.

56
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,925
(Joo Hae Ra)

57
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:09,610
Yes?

58
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:12,810
Did you give her Ha Kyung's... Hold on.

59
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:14,905
You've lent it to her before, haven't you?

60
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,220
Hold on.

61
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,350
I'll double your pay, so please deliver this quickly.

62
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,415
All right, don't worry.

63
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,285
It's on its way.

64
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,805
Quick delivery, sir.

65
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,635
- Thank you. - No problem, sir.

66
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:55,145
(Quick Delivery)

67
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,445
You've checked, so please leave.

68
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,245
I won't allow such inconvenience again.

69
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,490
Is there more you need to check?

70
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:04,645
No, sir. Thank you for your cooperation.

71
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:09,685
Goodbye.

72
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:43,015
Only 30 of these dresses were made, and all 30 of them have them?

73
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,325
Does that mean there were 31 of them?

74
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:49,055
- No, it's... - Listen.

75
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:50,925
Okay?

76
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,165
I'm a busy man.

77
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:56,365
You better bring me something before I lose...

78
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,905
my patience.

79
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,885
Darn it.

80
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,125
Ma Ri.

81
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:27,365
He left.

82
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,775
Ma Ri, are you all right?

83
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,475
Ma Ri.

84
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,915
Ma Ri. I'm coming in.

85
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,805
Ma Ri.

86
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,045
He left.

87
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,845
It's all right.

88
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:27,925
I'll help you get up.

89
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,275
Look at yourself.

90
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:56,315
The woman your husband is looking for...

91
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,255
She no longer exists.

92
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,655
He might still recognize me.

93
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,225
He always...

94
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,165
succeeded in finding me.

95
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:11,165
Ma Ri, you became a completely different person now.

96
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,605
Don't be afraid.

97
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:34,895
Ma Ri.

98
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,325
Where are you?

99
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,095
Where are you hiding, Ma Ri?

100
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:42,995
You know I can't live without you.

101
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,935
How could you...

102
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,510
How could you do this to me?

103
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,745
You can't do this to me.

104
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:23,605
Lavender will help you soothe and calm down.

105
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,120
You must be tense. Let's soak your feet.

106
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,845
It will help you get better.

107
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,655
Out of 30 people,

108
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:16,095
she's the only one...

109
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:18,365
I couldn't see in real.

110
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,435
Woo Ha Kyung.

111
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,635
She has to be the one.

112
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,985
I'm done being your acting wife for today.

113
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,095
Great work today.

114
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:54,870

(VVIP)

116
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,910
This is your emergency number.

117
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:00,680
Call me when you're only in danger.

118
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,635
I'll reject any prank calls.

119
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,185
If you decide on where to live, don't forget to let me know.

120
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,345
Don't worry about me.

121
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,985
I'll live with confidence from now on.

122
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,185
And...

123
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,025
I'll be happy.

124
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,230
What are you doing here at this time?

125
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:51,530
I need to check something.

126
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,555
I thought I made it clear.

127
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,455
I can't stand this rude behaviour one more time.

128
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,410
I need to check...

129
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,965
if the woman inside is your actual wife.

130
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,675
Why? Is there a problem?

131
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:15,315
- If you don't show me right now... - Honey.

132
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:37,265
Do we have a guest?

133
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,030
Go inside.

134
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,955
Is there something I can help you with?

135
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,685
There must have been...

136
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,215
a mistake.

137
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,725
Excuse me.

138
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,035
Let's go inside.

139
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,035
It's okay. He didn't recognize you.

140
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,575
You were courageous...

141
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,475
and strong.

142
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:24,895
I just started to provide an acting service like you.

143
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,925
I'll be your social worker.

144
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,405
It's a program to rehabilitate those who are in need.

145
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,365
Do you want to join?

146
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:38,745
Yoon Ma Ri.

147
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,415
What are your plans for residency?

148
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,685
Can you possibly get a place without identification or deposit?

149
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:51,785
You already owe me one. Another one wouldn't hurt.

150
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,900
- What? - You have something to pay me back.

151
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:57,655
Feel free to get more loans.

152
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:03,335
There's a personal reference inside. This will help you find a place.

153
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:14,145
Also, this is a small gift...

154
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:16,015
from me.

155
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,650
(I've made them so that you can heat up a meal at a time.)

156
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,150
(Don't skip your meals.)

157
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:53,205
I've made them so that you can heat up a meal at a time.

158
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:56,045
Don't skip your meal.

(Soybean paste stew)

161
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:20,665
Here you are.

162
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,115
This is a good choice.

163
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,825
The view is also great.

164
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:43,855
Like the woman of this face,

165
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,895
I will be strong and live with courage.

166
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,135
Thank you.

167
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,665
Thank you so much.

168
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,480
This is your only option that allows you to...

169
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:58,705
move in immediately with affordable rent.

170
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:06,890
Mom.

171
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,715
You're well, right?

172
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:13,255
This place is near where you are.

173
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,720
You went through all senior care centres across the country...

174
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,315
Yes, but I couldn't find her anywhere.

175
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,215
Spread her picture.

176
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,215
Are you sure? What if the chairman finds out?

177
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:46,585
My mother-in-law is a patient with an unstable mind.

178
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:49,300
She disappeared from the hospital.

179
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,865
It's my duty as a son-in-law to look for her.

180
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:54,425
Yes, I understand.

181
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:03,035
This lamp will protect me with warmth.

182
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,075
Just like the meaning of your name,

183
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,675
walk forward without getting lost.

184
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:17,015
Rosemary, also called the dew of the sea.

185
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:21,315
It will guide me whenever I become lost.

186
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,115
Thank you, Doctor.

187
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:11,635
Here are the documents about Woo Ha Kyung.

188
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:23,175
I've already checked her face,

189
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,615
but there's something odd about her.

190
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:31,855
Do further research about this woman.

191
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:35,030
Including every bit of her personal life.

192
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:36,525
Okay.

193
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:26,945
If you wish to get a job,

194
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:28,690
you must have a number.

195
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,845
The account is under my name. Use this for now.

196
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:41,955
Thank you.

197
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:44,155
Do you want to try calling your number one contact?

198
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:47,125
Yes.

199
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:58,150
(Calling...)

200
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,375
(VVIP)

201
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,445
This is your emergency number.

202
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:08,015
Call me when you're only in danger. I'll reject any prank calls.

203
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,235
If you decide on where to live,

204
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:29,235
don't forget to let me know.

205
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,865
(Episode 10)

206
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:23,425
(Gyoha to Hongdae)

207
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,635
Excuse me, but who are you?

208
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,145
I'm...

209
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,415
Ma'am, let's go back inside.

210
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:56,890
Why did you come so late?

211
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:59,155
I've been waiting for you.

212
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:03,955
You must be her daughter's friend.

213
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,735
Yes.

214
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:11,535
I came on her behalf.

215
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:15,450
Goodness, she misses her daughter so much.

216
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,010
But it seems like she's still abroad.

217
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,480
I heard she went far away.

218
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:22,115
I've missed you so much.

219
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,070
Don't toss the blanket around.

220
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:45,295
You shouldn't catch a cold.

221
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:56,220
You need to eat well until I return next time.

222
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,960
Take your medication on time as well,

223
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,385
okay?

224
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:05,925
This place is suffocating.

225
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,695
I need to go to the bus stop.

226
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,265
Can you take me to my husband?

227
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:19,010
He doesn't know where I am.

228
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:20,665
What should I do?

229
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:25,445
Mom.

230
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,745
Please be patient.

231
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:30,875
I'll settle down quickly and come back for you.

232
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:33,185
So, please...

233
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,855
Please be a little bit more patient, okay?

234
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:52,880
I'm exhausted.

235
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,305
Good work.

236
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,580
You are, indeed, skilled.

237
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:59,250
I would've given up on that patient.

238
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:01,875
I wouldn't have done it without you. Thanks.

239
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,950
If you're grateful, how about we grab a drink tonight?

240
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,360
Next time.

241
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:07,845
Dr. Seo.

242
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:10,785
You keep postponing it.

243
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:12,555
Don't you know this saying?

244
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,760
"Who knows whether tomorrow will come first..."

245
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,855
"or the next life will come first?"

246
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:38,590
The surgery ended late.

247
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:40,585
It must've been a complicated one.

248
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,755
Thanks. If it wasn't for you, we would've been in trouble.

249
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:52,525
What's going on?

250
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,210
Ms. Yoon's husband looked very frightening.

251
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:58,370
I was so scared that I looked into it.

252
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:02,310
Research says, there are many violent husbands in the US,

253
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:04,380
the UK, Japan, and even here.

254
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:05,820
And it's growing.

255
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,550
There are two types of men who are violent.

256
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:10,090
The first ones are bullfights.

257
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:12,720
They suddenly get enraged.

258
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,630
Usually, their wives also fight back,

259
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,285
so to others, it may just seem like a couple fighting.

260
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,385
Do you know what the second type is?

261
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,155
Cobras.

262
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:26,865
These type of men are cold-hearted and cruel.

263
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,810
So their wives...

264
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,235
are nothing but frogs who have been caught by the cobras.

265
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:35,580
These type of men are charismatic,

266
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,305
so women are easily infatuated with them.

267
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,875
And these cobras...

268
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,445
easily find such lonely women.

269
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,830
Did you find out anything?

270
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,630
I looked into the 30 individuals...

271
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,955
and found something peculiar.

272
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:59,125
These two women are friends.

273
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:02,370
(Joo Hae Ra, Woo Ha Kyung)

274
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,395
They're Woo Ha Kyung and Joo Hae Ra.

275
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:08,440
It's been confirmed that...

276
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:11,035
they each bought the dress on the same day.

277
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,315
They're friends who go shopping together...

278
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,245
and buy the same clothes.

279
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,345
Something smells fishy.

280
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:31,400
You've researched a lot.

281
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,570
It's not funny.

282
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:37,665
Imagine how worried I must've been to read up on these dissertations.

283
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,405
I have another surgery scheduled.

284
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:49,090
She needs to leave your place,

285
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,845
or you'll be in danger too.

286
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,845
She left.

287
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,385
She did?

288
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,660
Good. You did the right thing.

289
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:03,655
That's only right. Well done.

290
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:07,265
She decided to leave on her own.

291
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:10,095
Really?

292
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,505
Hey,

293
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,835
what do you think of her?

294
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:23,845
I was worried...

295
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:27,085
you'd perceive her as Ha Kyung.

296
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:29,555
What?

297
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:31,755
It's nothing like that.

298
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,465
He seriously needs to distance himself from her.

299
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:20,425
They might become my first client.

300
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:15,860
I'll conclude my morning schedule at this.

301
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:17,655
Okay, professor.

302
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:20,385
I heard you're giving a lecture today.

303
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:25,700
Please take care of this place for me.

304
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:27,965
Don't you worry about a thing.

305
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,810
He's so amazing.

306
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:35,975
He's always amazing.

307
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:41,175
It seems like your boss wants more pieces of art.

308
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:44,275
For this quarter, we need about 20 of them.

309
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:47,460
That's wonderful.

310
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:49,660
Who is this man?

311
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,530
I'd like to meet him.

312
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,260
Don't be so curious.

313
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,925
And he won't ever be at your beck and call.

314
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,870
Yes, sir.

315
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,470
I see. Yes, sir.

316
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:04,095
Okay, sir.

317
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:08,665
("The Unrivalled Leader of Gunha Group")

318
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:11,735
It's that man.

319
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:14,205
Was Ms. Yoon's husband...

320
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:17,245
the president of Gunha Group?

321
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:19,215
"Kang..."

322
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:20,785
"In..."

323
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,485
"Wook".

324
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,135
Have you...

325
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:19,645
been well?

326
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:23,515
I have.

327
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,585
Did you find...

328
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,585
a place to stay?

329
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:32,185
I have.

330
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,005
Ms. Joo Hae Ra.

331
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,085
We meet again.

332
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,345
What brings you here?

333
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:29,345
I came to meet Ms. Joo.

334
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:32,275
I didn't know I'd run into you two.

335
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:37,485
Let's go.

336
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:38,985
We're going to be late.

337
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,855
Ms. Woo Ha Kyung.

338
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:44,555
May I have a word with you?

339
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,025
Sorry, we're running late.

340
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,885
You're here for me?

341
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,785
What is it?

342
00:44:52,707 --> 00:44:54,265
Sit down.

343
00:44:58,813 --> 00:45:00,505
Please bring us some tea.

344
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:07,375
To what do I owe the pleasure?

345
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,615
I can see that...

346
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,715
you have many great paintings.

347
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,790
If you're here for the art...

348
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,355
No. Not the paintings.

349
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,155
I'm here for someone.

350
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,645
Thank you.

351
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:48,485
Where do you live?

352
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:53,625
I'm okay now. You can leave.

353
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:23,215
This is it.

354
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:43,270
I have a lecture today.

355
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,510
I'll call you when I'm done.

356
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,065
I'm sorry.

357
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:49,635
I shouldn't have come so suddenly.

358
00:47:50,017 --> 00:47:52,775
Don't be. I'm glad you did.

359
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:55,575
I was curious about...

360
00:47:55,723 --> 00:47:57,715
whether you had found a house...

361
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:58,820
and how you were doing.

362
00:47:58,826 --> 00:48:00,415
I...

363
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:05,185
I had no idea that he'd go there.

364
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:09,855
Don't worry, and go rest.

365
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:56,505
I will...

366
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:58,635
find her.

367
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:03,475
She's someone very dear to me.

368
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,560
How can I help you?

369
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:09,545
Just don't lie to me.

370
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,715
- I've never lied to you. - Really?

371
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:17,695
I found out you and Ms. Woo went to the same college.

372
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:22,165
Why didn't you tell me?

373
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,710
Why did I have to tell you that?

374
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,280
Because it's crucial information.

375
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:33,080
That day, I went to her place after visiting you.

376
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:36,020
But I found the same exact dress there as well.

377
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:38,290
Friends could share similar preferences.

378
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:39,520
Is that wrong?

379
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:41,160
Only 30 pieces were made,

380
00:49:41,161 --> 00:49:44,260
and all 30 purchasers had that dress.

381
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:46,900
I guess no one could throw it away.

382
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,530
It's a dress worth keeping.

383
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:49,955
Here's the issue.

384
00:49:51,939 --> 00:49:54,095
I have that dress as well.

385
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:27,365
No matter what disguise you put on or where you are, I will find you.

386
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,195
So give up trying to run away from me.

387
00:51:00,374 --> 00:51:03,140
"Fear Comes for Me."

388
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,565
(Fear Comes for Me.)
