1
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,325
I couldn't hold onto her.

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,325
She was like a fragile bird.

3
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,965
She was like a flower drenched in rain.

4
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,605
But I had to let her go.

5
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,715
I had no choice but to desperately hope.

6
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:44,285
Hope that she won't be afraid.

7
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,285
Hope that she won't be in pain.

8
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,785
Hope that she wouldn't let go...

9
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,925
of her hope for freedom.

10
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:04,035
(Episode 33: Overcome All Adversities)

11
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,115
I heard you dropped by your workroom.

12
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,285
I had a painting to finish.

13
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:59,755
That's good.

14
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,955
Everything is fine...

15
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,025
as long as you know...

16
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,135
that this is where you belong.

17
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,865
Hey, you're here.

18
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:49,875
Where have you been?

19
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:52,845
I went to Hongi-dong.

20
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,045
Ma Ri's rooftop?

21
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:59,585
Why?

22
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,155
I met her.

23
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,395
I guess...

24
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,570
she's not confined.

25
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:11,465
It feels like...

26
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,035
she locked herself up in her own prison.

27
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,905
She told me that she was going to start all over again with him...

28
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,705
and didn't want to see me ever again.

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,305
She pushed me away.

30
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:30,445
It feels like she made that choice for me.

31
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,285
It breaks my heart.

32
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,655
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

33
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,065
Her heart told me.

34
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,795
Her eyes told me.

35
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:50,335
I couldn't hear, but I could feel.

36
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,765
I couldn't see,

37
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,775
but I knew.

38
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:58,605
I only felt her heart.

39
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,015
And that was everything to her.

40
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,655
Your surgery is scheduled for next Tuesday.

41
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,555
They're the best surgeons. You don't have to worry.

42
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,170
What's wrong?

43
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,655
Aren't you happy?

44
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:18,625
You're getting your old face back.

45
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,635
I am happy.

46
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,180
Stay hidden just until this weekend.

47
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,935
Don't let Father see you.

48
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,005
Bouillabaisse.

49
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,275
It's been a while...

50
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,015
since you've cooked for me.

51
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,615
I could've ordered this,

52
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,685
but I missed your dish.

53
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,395
You know,

54
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,595
while you were gone,

55
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,395
I realized once again.

56
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,165
The reason why...

57
00:04:58,315 --> 00:04:59,865
I could endure...

58
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,035
this cruel world...

59
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,805
was because of you.

60
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,745
There are no other reasons.

61
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:11,515
Without you, I'm good as dead. Yet, you left...

62
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,115
You were cruel.

63
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,755
Do you know how shocked I was...

64
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,955
to find your will?

65
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,070
Oh, right.

66
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,965
We forgot the wine.

67
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:27,495
We need some.

68
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,035
Right.

69
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,065
Had I not found...

70
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:34,575
the bag you had lost,

71
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,250
I would've thought you were dead to this day.

72
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,705
The bag.

73
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,315
It was like a scene from a movie.

74
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,845
There was money, clothes,

75
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:46,415
and a new phone in there.

76
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,030
But you see,

77
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,585
a suicidal person wouldn't have packed such things.

78
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,625
After I found that bag,

79
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,025
I was so happy.

80
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,295
I knew that you were still alive.

81
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,165
I had hoped...

82
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,735
that we'd meet again.

83
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,805
We could reunite only because...

84
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,175
I didn't give up.

85
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,245
Let's make a toast.

86
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,985
To the perfect wife...

87
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:23,115
that I'll be seeing once again next week...

88
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,025
and to our happy future.

89
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,625
Cheers.

90
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:53,315
Can you look into Gunha Group's household?

91
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,360
Not anything public, but personal.

92
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:58,100
A group of wealthy madams...

93
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,655
who attend auctions together meet up every now and then.

94
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,025
I can join them with the pretext of introducing new pieces.

95
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,565
But...

96
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,965
don't you think you're going too far?

97
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:12,265
We're talking about Gunha Group here.

98
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:16,105
I just need to distract Kang In Wook for a while.

99
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:20,575
If that's what you want,

100
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,315
how about I sue him?

101
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,130
If I sue him for trespass,

102
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,660
assault, and threat,

103
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,725
he'll be quite busy.

104
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,625
I'm sorry...

105
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,770
for dragging you into this.

106
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:40,940
I know you won't be dissuaded,

107
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,995
so I have no choice but to help.

108
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:47,165
I always wish for your happiness.

109
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,045
Yes?

111
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,115
Sure.

112
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:05,485
Okay. I'll see you then.

113
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,055
I thought you weren't going to appear on TV for a while.

114
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,040
Ma Ri got to know about me through the radio.

115
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:16,265
You want her to hear your voice?

116
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,975
It'd be better if I could let her know how I feel.

117
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,700
I don't know when you'll come back...

118
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:15,625
and read this.

119
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,865
But if you can't come,

120
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,395
I'll go to you.

121
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,765
Please wait for me.

122
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,815
(I don't know when you'll come back...)

123
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,370
Once we bring your mother here,

124
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,810
you should file for divorce.

125
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,875
I'll become stronger.

126
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,275
You should be too.

127
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,460
I created my own prison,

128
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,460
and I closed the door after me.

129
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:20,800
And the key...

130
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:24,565
is also in my hands. The key to this prison.

131
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,465
The key to this prison.

132
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,995
Had I not found...

133
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,505
the bag you had lost,

134
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,175
I would've thought you were dead to this day.

135
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:43,975
Ma Ri.

136
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,545
Ma Ri!

137
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:47,960
Go west.

138
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,190
Find anything, big or small.

139
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,725
Did they not find it in the bag?

140
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,250
For your lunch appointment with the minister,

141
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,815
I think this tie would be best.

142
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,585
Right.

143
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:28,025
I heard that Ma Ri is in the annex.

144
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:29,970
- What? - Your son...

145
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:33,200
sent all the workers at the annex away.

146
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,310
And in their place, he appointed guards.

147
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:37,735
Wait.

148
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:54,190
You...

149
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:55,830
No one can go up, sir.

150
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,660
Step aside!

Chairman Kang is on the second floor.

Don't you dare let him inside.

Sir. Sir, you shouldn't come here.

How dare you stop me?

163
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,175
Stop it.

164

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,025
Where...

175
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,395
Where did that wretched face...

176
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,095
of yours go?

177
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:49,640
I erased it.

178
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,635
What? What?

179
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,310
What did you say?

180
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,105
It's no longer here.

181
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:59,675
That face was the very reason why I lived in misery.

182
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:13,200
In Wook.

183
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:14,625
Get out of my way!

184
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,770
Just hit me like you always did.

185
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,495
What happened to her face?

186
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,470
She'll get her old face back.

187
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,840
I'll fix everything.

188
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,310
You lousy punk.

189
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,010
How dare you bring her here?

190
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:31,345
- Kick her out! - No.

191
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:34,945
We'll leave.

192
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,475
That's great.

193
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,220
But leave everything you have behind.

194
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:42,230
And you'll no longer have your position at the company!

195
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:43,660
That's fine.

196
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,030
But you must know that once I leave Gunha Group,

197
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,370
you'll have to be prepared to lose everything.

198
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:52,265
- What? - That's because...

199
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:57,165
I know many of your secrets.

200
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,445
Move aside.

201
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:03,935
It's okay.

202
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,605
Don't worry.

203
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,205
I'll protect you.

204
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:16,545
The flowers have yet to bloom.

205
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:21,255
But she's already cutting the buds...

206
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,885
one by one.

207
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:28,455
As she hides in coldness,

208
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,295
I must save her.

209
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,565
Under bright sunshine,

210
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,305
I must make her life blossom.

211
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:40,105
I really want to...

212
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,835
have a nice meal out,

213
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,505
but I need to take care of someone.

214
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,815
I have to go see him.

215
00:16:58,467 --> 00:16:59,885
Come in.

216
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,995
I'm coming back from the meeting I told you about before.

217
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,995
It was hard listening to those people.

218
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,835
Did you find out anything?

219
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,775
You were right.

220
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,350
About the death of Kang In Wook's mother...

221
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,680
Gunha Group covered up the cause as an accident,

222
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,750
and it's known for a fact that...

223
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,860
she committed suicide due to domestic violence.

224
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,890
Do you think anyone will testify to that?

225
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:29,690
Why would any wives of those rich families...

226
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:32,355
want to become the enemy of Gunha Group?

227
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,535
(President Kang)

228
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,265
Answer it.

229
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,250
Ms. Joo Hae Ra?

230
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,020
It's too late to be polite.

231
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,575
I will never...

232
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,090
drop the charges.

233
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:57,890
Let's talk mathematics.

234
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,890
Who will be the one to gain and who will suffer a loss?

235
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,615
Let's do some mental math here.

236
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,200
Okay.

237
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:11,055
I'll notify you about the time and location through my assistant.

238
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,175
I knew you would come, Mr. Seo.

239
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,715
Goodness.

240
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,185
You're not looking so good.

241
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,730
Unlike you,

242
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,485
I don't have any concerns because I have my wife back.

243
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,330
Last night, we had a nice talk over some drinks.

244
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:17,325
I guess happiness...

245
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,800
isn't something large.

246
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,365
I would never know if it was a nice talk or blackmail...

247
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,810
until I hear from both sides.

248
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:25,365
Excuse me.

249
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:28,535
Ma Ri is my wife.

250
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:31,150
She won't make the same mistake,

251
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,520
and I also will try my best.

252
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:37,115
We'll have a baby that looks just like us soon.

253
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,045
But...

254
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,760
I hear that Joo Hae Ra is filing a lawsuit against me.

255
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,530
Of course, it was part of your plan.

256
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:48,195
You've been quite clumsy handling things.

257
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,600
I have the written diagnosis from the hospital as evidence.

258
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,070
That...

259
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,870
I will compensate generously.

260
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,795
This will be a challenging lawsuit.

261
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,310
You have to deal with the press as well.

262
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:58,935
The public...

263
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,380
always loves scandals about us conglomerates.

264
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:03,705
I'm used to that kind of blackmail.

265
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,750
You should help yourself.

266
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,275
I already ate.

267
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:11,415
We're not exactly friends, are we?

268
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,445
Let go of Ma Ri.

269
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,085
What you're doing is...

270
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:17,730
illegal confinement.

271
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,085
Here we go again.

272
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:21,995
Ma Ri...

273
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,130
came back to me at her will.

274
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,995
I won't give up.

275
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,670
I will never give up...

276
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,495
until I save Ma Ri from you.

277
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,705
Never.

278
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,775
There's nothing good to eat on your menu.

279
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,175
I better go now.

280
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,285
I have a radio program to attend.

281
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,730
For the second half, we have Dr. Seo back with us in a long time.

282
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,185
- Hello. - Hello.

283
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:02,800
Last time you were on the show, you talked about flowers.

284
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:06,065
Do you have any more to tell us?

285
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,695
I have flowers that I want to give to a person I love.

286
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,240
People add meanings and interesting stories...

287
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,505
to beautiful flowers.

288
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,680
Therefore, giving flowers to someone...

289
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,080
is a way of communication.

290
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,790
Madam has been looking for something from the house...

291
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,745
the entire day.

292
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,345
I want to give...

293
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,755
chamomiles to my beloved.

294
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,200
The more they're being stepped on, the better they grow.

295
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,155
It's very tenacious of life.

296
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:35,830
It overcomes adversities.

297
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:37,840
That's right. That's why it symbolizes...

298
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,065
energy in times of adversity.

299
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,565
I really hope that person...

300
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,435
remembers the symbol of chamomile.

301
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:48,975
The key to set you free...

302
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:51,405
is already within our hands.

303
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,645
I want to give her courage.

304
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:58,360
Chamomile is certainly the flower to give to those who are struggling.

305
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,345
We'll be back after some music.

306
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,910
I won't go back to...

307
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,510
running away, hiding, and being in fear.

308
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:19,710
How can I help you?

309
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:23,510
I ran away and hid multiple times, but I feel the safest right now.

310
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,150
Hiding behind this face.

311
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,720
This is on me.

312
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,715
I got my pay today.

313
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:33,020
I'm really happy right now.

314
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:37,015
I can paint as much as I want to and enjoy freedom.

315
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,125
This is the happiest time of my entire life.

316
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:47,600
Chamomile grows stronger...

317
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:50,165
the more they're stepped on.

318
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:52,840
With the key to prison in its hands,

319
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,605
it will blossom.

320
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,745
Loving you in every way.

321
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,955
It's not love if you only love during good times.

322
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,985
I love you...

323
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,760
in every way.

324
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:15,325
The flower that only grows in my heart.

325
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,295
I will protect you.

326
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,115
I heard you've been looking for the bag all day.

327
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:47,430
My dad's belongings are inside.

328
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:48,995
I see.

329
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,470
Everything is kept inside as it was.

330
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,495
I figured that it means a lot to you.

331
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,035
Thank you.

332
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,365
Ma Ri.

333
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,175
I will...

334
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:05,020
try my best to change.

335
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,845
I want you to trust me.

336
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:08,615
And I'll also...

337
00:25:09,825 --> 00:25:11,545
trust you.

338
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:42,115
Do you still drink alone?

339
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,185
I told you to call me when you drink alone.

340
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,685
I just lost wanting to drink.

341
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:50,685
Sit down.

342
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,625
I'm just trying to help you guys.

343
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,035
- I mean it. - You.

344
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,835
Kang In Wook has leverage on you, doesn't he?

345
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,380
That's why you're not working at the hospital, isn't it?

346
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:12,845
He was making a scene telling me to restore Yoon Ma Ri's face.

347
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:15,120
So I found the right surgeon.

348
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,845
- What? - I helped plan the surgery...

349
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:19,360
by getting the best surgeons in the world.

350
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,590
That's too dangerous.

351
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:24,255
It's too risky and the success rate is also low.

352
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:29,955
- Is he crazy? - Yes, he is crazy.

353
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,725
Which is why...

354
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:33,725
you should avoid him.

355
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:35,435
Don't try to win.

356
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,335
Jung Won isn't avoiding.

357
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,740
Once he sets a goal,

358
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,635
he's so determined.

359
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,005
I bet Kang In Wook will win this fight.

360
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,575
And also...

361
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:50,820
I don't bet stakes for the losing side.

362
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,285
So you're saying...

363
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,455
that you will betray him again?

364
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,755
I don't have any more to lose.

365
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,625
What?

366
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,125
Surgery?

367
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:10,865
Yes.

368
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:16,275
Kang In Wook is planning to restore Ma Ri's face at last.

369
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,980
The surgeons will arrive in Korea soon.

370
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,520
The location is set up as well.

371
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:29,745
(Episode 34)

372
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:55,970
During my escape from here,

373
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:58,210
I was going to use this.

374
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,680
I wanted to expose him to the world...

375
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,205
and regain my freedom.

376
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,820
I've found hope that I had once lost.

377
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:07,375
It's all good now.

378
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,815
This is enough.

379
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,015
Was this it?

380
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,325
Was this what you were looking for so desperately?

381
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:22,300
What?

382
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:23,795
What is this?

383
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,925
In... In Wook.

384
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,615
You want to paint?

385
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,895
That was a monster.

386
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:06,435
It's like the one I saw when I was young.

387
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:09,275
My father.

388
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:22,285
It's your fault.

389
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:26,185
Everything...

390
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:28,895
is your fault.

391
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:35,865
Right.

392
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,665
I understand now.

393
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:41,105
This was proof.

394
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:46,705
You came back for evidence.

395
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,175
You and Seo Jung Won planned to sue me for assault.

396
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,155
All that I did...

397
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:58,760
was search for you desperately.

398
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,900
All that I needed was your love.

399
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:03,300
But yet...

400
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,755
Yet again,

401
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,425
you lied to me.

402
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,705
Do you really not know?

403
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:19,705
Don't you understand why I left you?

404
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:24,075
Don't you get why I had to change my face and hide?

405
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:27,660
I endured it for five years.

406
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:29,530
I waited for you to change!

407
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,185
And I have.

408
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,285
You're the one who didn't.

409
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,155
You're always busy, thinking of ways to run away.

410
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:39,840
You deceive me with your lies.

411
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:41,825
Your heart...

412
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:45,435
is ill.

413
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:49,535
You believe suspicion and obsession...

414
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:52,205
are love.

415
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,290
You believe using violence to keep me here...

416
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,815
is love.

417
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:04,285
Beg.

418
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:07,825
Like always.

419
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:11,425
You're at fault here.

420
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,425
So...

421
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,965
beg me for forgiveness.

422
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,235
Then I'll forgive you.

423
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,205
No.

424
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,910
I won't do that anymore.

425
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,335
Why not?

426
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,675
Because of Jung Won?

427
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,515
Does he give you courage?

428
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:34,360
Tell him to come this instant and save you.

429
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:36,530
No matter how much you scream,

430
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:38,160
he's not here.

431
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,585
This is...

432
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,195
your reality.

433
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,395
So beg.

434
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,465
You're at fault.

435
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:51,165
Beg.

436
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:53,680
You used to do that so well.

437
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,910
Beg.

438
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,180
Beg!

439
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,105
Beg right now!

440
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:10,985
No.

441
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,855
I won't.

442
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,805
I love you.

443
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,875
I did that because I love you so much.

444
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:44,075
All I need is you by my side.

445
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:47,045
So...

446
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:51,755
can you just stay with me?

447
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,285
Can you...

448
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:56,695
just...

449
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,125
love me?

450
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,590
Did you hear? Dr. Seo is involved in a lawsuit.

451
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,860
What could he have done wrong?

452
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,330
If it was Dr. Ha, I'd understand.

453
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,770
He wasn't charged. He'll sue someone.

454
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,340
For someone like him to do that,

455
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,210
that person must've been evil.

456
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,965
Who is that punk?

457
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,040
The president of Gunha Construction.

458
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:42,150
He's filthy rich. I heard he's very powerful.

459
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,150
Are we ready?

460
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:44,875
- Yes. - Yes.

461
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:47,850
I have nothing to do...

462
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:49,915
but this to cheer you on.

463
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,345
Dr. Seo, good luck.

464
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,390
- Thank you. - It'll all work out.

465
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,085
That lawsuit...

466
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,900
I mean, a formal suit... A tuxedo...

467
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:02,725
- Let's start. - Yes, doctor.

468
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:15,505
I thought it'd suit you.

469
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:18,775
Put your trust in me one last time.

470
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,905
I promise to change.

471
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,745
I can also become...

472
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,915
a good husband.

473
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,725
Let me.

474
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:40,295
Let me use the bathroom.

475
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:43,265
Okay, go on.

476
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,275
Excuse me for a minute.

477
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,005
Ma Ri.

478
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,250
Why are you here?

479
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:26,145
How are you doing? Are you all right?

480
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,920
My husband is out there.

481
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,050
We have guards too.

482
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,490
Jung Won is doing his best,

483
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:34,490
so hang in there.

484
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,730
Please dissuade him. It's too dangerous.

485
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,685
Don't worry. He's being cautious.

486
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,825
You don't look too well.

487
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,495
Are you sure you're all right?

488
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,035
Ma Ri.

489
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,775
Ma Ri.

490
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,585
Ma Ri.

491
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:17,055
- What is it? - He's waiting for you.

492
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:20,295
Okay, I'm going now.

493
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:23,595
Goodbye.

494
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,895
Hae Ra.

495
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:55,665
Jung Won.

496
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,465
Yes?

497
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,010
Never mind.

498
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,480
What is it?

499
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,275
No. It's nothing.

500
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:37,135
Thank you for agreeing to take on this case.

501
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,420
Yes, sir. All right.

502
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:44,790
I'll try to persuade the victim to speak up for herself as well.

503
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,415
Thank you.

504
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:58,125
You have something to say, right?

505
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,170
You kept beating around the bush.

506
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:03,270
I think you have the right to know.

507
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:04,510
Tell me.

508
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,005
This afternoon,

509
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,835
I ran into Ma Ri.

510
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:12,905
She...

511
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:17,775
She has bruises on her body.

512
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,360
All the covered areas...

513
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:22,115
had bruises underneath.

514
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:26,025
I think he beat her...

515
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:27,555
again.

516
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:33,425
Jung Won. Where are you going?

517
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:39,165
Tell Kang In Wook...

518
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,580
that Seo Jung Won is here.

519
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,880
No, sir. You must leave.

520
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:45,405
Tell him.

521
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:47,505
Please leave.

522
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,115
Kang In Wook!

523
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:56,615
Kang In Wook!

524
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,830
Dr. Seo Jung Won is here.

525
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:06,525
He's making a scene, asking to see you.

526
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,210
- Bring him in. - Sorry?

527
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,865
Bring him here,

528
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,005
and you may leave.

529
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,635
Yes, sir.

530
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,145
(Voice Recorder)

531
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,845
You're finally here.

532
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,085
Does that hurt?

533
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:14,185
Does it?

534
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:18,195
Where is she?

535
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:21,465
Ma Ri.

536
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,595
Ma Ri!

537
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:29,705
Ma Ri.

538
00:44:29,784 --> 00:44:31,405
Ma Ri!

539
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:39,015
- Are you okay? - You should leave.

540
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,820
Ma Ri, you need to leave. Let's go.

541
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:43,985
Leave right now!

542
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:46,325
- Let's go. - Hurry.

543
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:52,995
Ma Ri.

544
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,825
What's wrong?

545
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:57,335
Do we have a problem?

546
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,565
You just...

547
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,665
went on a long journey...

548
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:04,035
and came back...

549
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:05,975
to me.

550
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:07,705
Right?

551
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,455
Ma Ri.

552
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:21,055
We need to get out of here.

553
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,395
Let's go.

554
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:30,235
You should leave.

555
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:32,495
I'm okay.

556
00:45:32,747 --> 00:45:34,205
Please.

557
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,705
Gosh.

558
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:38,335
Hey.

559
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:41,945
Quit acting like you're meant to be.

560
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,375
It's very difficult to watch.

561
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,480
There's only one bullet in here.

562
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:13,945
In Wook.

563
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:15,350
In Wook, please stop.

564
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,375
I can prove my love for her again and again.

565
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:20,085
Ma Ri.

566
00:46:21,095 --> 00:46:22,915
I'd rather die...

567
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:26,325
than part with you.

568
00:46:43,117 --> 00:46:45,235
Words mean nothing.

569
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,705
But I have proven...

570
00:46:49,523 --> 00:46:51,315
my love for her.

571
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:54,185
In Wook! Please!

572
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:08,700
It's not love if you're still sane.

573
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,165
Don't you think so?

574
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,680
In Wook. In Wook. Please!

575
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:19,380
Stop this instant!

576
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:21,075
Please stop!

577
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,825
Love?

578
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:44,965
It's only for those who aren't afraid of dying.

579
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:48,035
That's the only love I know.

580
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:52,805
Okay. I understand, In Wook!

581
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:55,245
I love you too!

582
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,875
I love you! I do...

583
00:47:58,158 --> 00:47:59,690
I love you.

584
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,985
Ma Ri and I...

585
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:05,385
will wring each other's necks,

586
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,285
will love each other,

587
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:10,095
and will die together.

588
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:13,365
We're meant to be together.

589
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:27,505
We will...

590
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:29,975
love...

591
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:32,875
and die together.

592
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,425
Ma Ri.

593
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,765
I love you.

594
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:13,015
If you must prove...

595
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,555
your love...

596
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,490
