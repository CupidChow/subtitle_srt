1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,090
Would you like...

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,625
to have dinner with me tomorrow at a nice restaurant?

3
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:19,800
Tomorrow,

4
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:22,395
I'd like to officially confess my feelings to you.

5
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:45,615
(Episode 23: When the Endless Sorrow Douses My Heart)

6
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:58,095
Woo Ha Kyung said this picture would've caused a big issue...

7
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,410
if the car accident didn't happen.

8
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,035
That's strange though.

9
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,635
When I met Woo Ha Kyung,

10
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:08,775
she didn't look like this at all.

11
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:19,090
You liked my painting of anemone flowers,

12
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,325
so I brought it as a gift.

13
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,865
The gift I brought...

14
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,695
is a mess now.

15
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:34,235
They are pretty. It's okay.

16
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,805
Are you sure...

17
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,145
I can keep such a precious painting?

18
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,245
Thanks to you,

19
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,885
my paintings could become heartwarming.

20
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,825
To be honest,

21
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:59,095
I painted it for someone.

22
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,815
On my way to the train station,

23
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,485
I thought to myself.

24
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,815
I wanted to start all over again...

25
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,125
with you.

26
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:35,295
When I was waiting...

27
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,495
for the train that day...

28
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,765
In fact,

29
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:56,285
I couldn't get on the train.

30
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:01,025
So I bought another ticket...

31
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:04,225
and waited for the next train.

32
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,195
I might have wished...

33
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:11,765
you'd come and find me...

34
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,605
before the train arrived.

35
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,235
I knew you'd...

36
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:23,720
run into danger when I'm around.

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,615
But still,

38
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,985
I couldn't leave.

39
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,230
Thank you...

40
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:37,255
for coming to see me.

41
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:42,295
For asking me not to leave.

42
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,080
I don't want to go either.

43
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,935
But what I do I? I have no choice.

44
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,005
I feel like I lost my wife to Paris.

45
00:03:58,188 --> 00:04:01,185
You can't be jealous of a city.

46
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:10,825
I'll drive you to the airport.

47
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:14,870
I'll go by myself.

48
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:17,940
You know I don't want you to drive me to the airport.

49
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:19,040
Doctor Seo.

50
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,335
I need to take a day off.

51
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,640
Again?

52
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,680
Unlike you who is a workaholic,

53
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,780
I have my own life.

54
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,845
I enjoy my life.

55
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,915
And you just enjoy work.

56
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,890
Okay. Have a good day off.

57
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,760
Okay. Thanks.

58
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:40,255
Bye.

59
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,965
By the way,

60
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,235
is something wrong?

61
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:58,635
No.

62
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,675
This guy.

63
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,575
Look into Ha Seong Ho.

64
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,045
Until you have something that I can strangle his throat with,

65
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,955
keep digging.

66
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,935
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,405
We didn't get to talk much.

68
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,415
It's okay.

69
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,185
I need to drop by somewhere.

70
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,585
I'll see you at home later.

71
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,670
I don't even know. You figure it out yourself.

72
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,665
Go to jail or something.

73
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,070
Hey.

74
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,275
You call me your brother only at times like this.

75
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,910
I'm not your brother anymore.

76
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,880
Don't call me from now on.

77
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,575
Okay?

78
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,090
It was Seong Jun.

79
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:56,860
I just helped him get out of something a while ago.

80
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,795
But he's in trouble again.

81
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,795
I don't care if we're family or not. I'm just sick of this.

82
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,365
We need to talk.

83
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,535
Gosh, it's cold.

84
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:14,010
It's not like we're here to exercise.

85
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,905
What's the matter?

86
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,775
You look scary. It's not like you.

87
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,585
Ha Kyung...

88
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,125
was having an affair.

89
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,640
What are you talking about?

90
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:43,980
How could she even do that...

91
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,835
when she had a husband like you?

92
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,545
And Ha Kyung is not even here anymore.

93
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,445
Why would you bring that up?

94
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,125
Ha Kyung and you.

95
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,025
What was going on between you two?

96
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,440
What do you mean? We were just friends.

97
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,635
We all were friends together.

98
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,775
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

99
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,295
This isn't me.

100
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a composite picture.

101
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,100
I may not be a good guy,

102
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,835
but I wouldn't do such a thing.

103
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,710
Who sent this to you?

104
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:51,335
I knew that...

105
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,375
Ha Kyung was seeing someone.

106
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,715
She had a lot of appointments...

107
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,455
and often went on business trips that lasted for a week.

108
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,125
And...

109
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,325
it turns out...

110
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,565
it was you.

111
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,535
Explain to me.

112
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,675
Gosh.

113
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,115
I thought everything was over.

114
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,195
But it ends up like this.

115
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:56,965
Right. It's me.

116
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,720
You call me out late at night...

117
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,715
every time.

118
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,125
You come into my head...

119
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,455
all of a sudden late at night every time.

120
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,725
Have a seat.

121
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,765
Is your hand okay?

122
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,535
Well...

123
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,745
It's good enough to pick up some pictures of adultery.

124
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:22,725
What are these?

125
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,160
How did you get these?

126
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,695
In this country,

127
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,695
there's nothing you can't do when you have money.

128
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,065
I hope...

129
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:37,835
you didn't tell him before you found out the truth.

130
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,980
I'll call Doctor Seo and find it out.

131
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,605
Too bad.

132
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,115
I already told him.

133
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,945
I'm going crazy looking for my runaway wife.

134
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:53,185
I wanted him to feel the same way.

135
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,925
He might be have a fight or something...

136
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,665
under the moonlight by now.

137
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,365
Right?

138
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,835
I hope...

139
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,175
you'd deny it.

140
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:17,345
- Saying it's not true. - Why?

141
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,645
Why can't it be me?

142
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,555
- What? - Why can't I have her?

143
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,455
Oh, right.

144
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,995
I barely graduated from medical school...

145
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:35,065
thanks to your parents' support.

146
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,995
So I can't even dare to love Ha Kyung?

147
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,835
Do you think I don't even deserve to love someone?

148
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,805
I was serious.

149
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:47,405
I loved Ha Kyung with all my heart.

150
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,705
But Ha Kyung...

151
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,815
chose you as her husband.

152
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,545
And you...

153
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:58,685
didn't even think of me as a rival.

154
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,290
I had a hard time too.

155
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,490
Looking at you and Ha Kyung.

156
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,225
Stop it!

157
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,465
Don't say anything more about it.

158
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,775
And we're not...

159
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,515
going to see each other again.

160
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,445
You're in love with Seo Jung Won.

161
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,720
So you can't tell me anything.

162
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,315
But Ha Seong Ho is different.

163
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,590
He can tell me.

164
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,195
What...

165
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,295
Woo Ha Kyung is hiding.

166
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:15,165
Then...

167
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,670
you should've called Seong Ho instead of me.

168
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,870
I can't get what I want before I know the whole story.

169
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,605
I'm now...

170
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,535
looking for a leash that fits Ha Seong Woo.

171
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,705
Then...

172
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,975
why did you tell Doctor Seo about it?

173
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,745
There should be a gap...

174
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,555
so I can peep in.

175
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:42,555
A gap starts from a crack.

176
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,495
Once Seo Jung Won and Woo Ha Kyung have a gap between them,

177
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:50,065
I will be able to look in through it...

178
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,435
and find Ma Ri.

179
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:59,275
If you told me,

180
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,845
none of this would've happened.

181
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,275
I told you.

182
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,285
You shouldn't look for a woman who has left you.

183
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:12,015
Didn't it occur to you?

184
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,185
Your wife might have...

185
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,095
found someone...

186
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:21,195
she loves already.

187
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,205
Then...

188
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:30,465
I'll kill them.

189
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,845
Who?

190
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,375
Both of them.

191
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,915
That's love.

192
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,025
(Joo Hae Ra)

193
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,030
(Ha Seong Ho)

194
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,295
Answer it.

195
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:34,565
Answer it now.

196
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:43,645
I can't believe this.

197
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,475
How could it be Ha Seong Ho?

198
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,255
How...

199
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,625
How could his best friend do that to him?

200
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,255
Woo Ha Kyung, that wench.

201
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,525
You wench.

202
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,540
(Seo Jung Won)

203
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,065
(Calling Seo Jung Won)

204
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:45,275
What are you...

205
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,205
doing here?

206
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,310
I'm being followed, so...

207
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,720
So?

208
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,245
Do you...

209
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,645
live here with Jung Won?

210
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:00,655
That's what happened.

211
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,360
Where's Jung Won? Is he home?

212
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,595
He isn't home yet.

213
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,435
Did something happen to him?

214
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:29,850
Ma Ri.

215
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,155
You might think Jung Won is a perfect guy.

216
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:36,225
But you're mistaken.

217
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,130
Do you know Jung Won's slogan for reconstructive plastic surgery?

218
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:42,630
"Cure a wounded heart..."

219
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,935
"and give a new life."

220
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,095
But...

221
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,465
the one that should be cured...

222
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:51,635
is Jung Won's heart.

223
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,805
Jung Won's marriage was a disaster.

224
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,545
Ha Kyung...

225
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,885
didn't love Jung Won even for a moment.

226
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:05,785
Ha Kyung...

227
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,625
had affairs throughout her marriage.

228
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,925
And Jung Won waited for her pretending not to know about it.

229
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,270
He thought she would come back someday.

230
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:21,265
He couldn't just accept it.

231
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:24,835
That the love of his life...

232
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,105
was a fake...

233
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,905
and an illusion.

234
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:39,415
Do you even know what happened today?

235
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,855
Your husband, Kang In Wook,

236
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,400
told Jung Won a truth...

237
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,835
that will completely break him down.

238
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,265
He's told that Woo Ha Kyung was...

239
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:59,405
having an affair with his best friend.

240
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,495
Now Jung Won...

241
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,065
has lost his wife...

242
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,605
and his long-time friend and colleague.

243
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,835
So...

244
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:36,280
how do you think Jung Won will feel when he sees your face?

245
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,245
He'll be more heartbroken whenever he sees you.

246
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:42,085
And now you're staying here with him like this?

247
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,585
Ever since he was little,

248
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:50,655
he would bring birds with broken wings...

249
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,595
and stray cats home.

250
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:57,965
I guess that's how he feels about you.

251
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,740
If you understand his pain and suffering a little,

252
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,940
you can't stay here with him like this.

253
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:05,705
Even if you're being followed and put in danger.

254
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,405
Don't you think so?

255
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:35,435
It serves you just right, Seo Jung Won.

256
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,345
You.

257
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:46,775
What did I tell you when you were going to marry Ha Kyung?

258
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,985
I said you should be a better judge of character.

259
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,990
What?

260
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:55,755
It's your choice whether she deserves your love or not?

261
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,060
So?

262
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,065
Is this what you get after loving Woo Ha Kyung?

263
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:10,140
And now you live with Yoon Ma Ri who looks like Woo Ha Kyung?

264
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,905
Do you think this makes any sense?

265
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:23,885
Woo Ha Kyung, that wench.

266
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:27,885
I didn't want to tell you this,

267
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,655
but do you even know what that wench did?

268
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,865
She even had your child aborted.

269
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,835
When she had an abortion,

270
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:47,310
I took her to the hospital.

271
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:49,375
She had...

272
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,305
your child aborted...

273
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:54,345
right in front of me.

274
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,645
But she pretended that she had a miscarriage.

275
00:22:58,093 --> 00:23:00,985
And she pretended to be sad.

276
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,295
Woo Ha Kyung, that wench was a despicable liar.

277
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,100
Please pull yourself together...

278
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:10,470
and kick Yoon Ma Ri out of the house.

279
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,595
Otherwise, Kang In Wook will...

280
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,135
kill you.

281
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,575
This is...

282
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,945
my last advice as a friend.

283
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:25,575
You should remember that.

284
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:49,705
Will I be able to love someone again?

285
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:51,935
I'm afraid...

286
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,735
and cautious.

287
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,615
I'll tell you...

288
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,485
all the reasons tomorrow.

289
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:41,485
Hey.

290
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:49,895
Cool.

291
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:57,305
All right.

292
00:24:58,714 --> 00:24:59,740
Do you like it?

293
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,275
Yes. It's lovely.

294
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,515
That can't be true.

295
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,145
No.

296
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,225
No.

297
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,695
It's not true.

298
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:38,645
How could he live with Yoon Ma Ri?

299
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,985
I mean... How...

300
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,785
He made me say things I shouldn't have said.

301
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:51,155
Why does he make me so miserable?

302
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,325
Doctor Seo.

303
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,835
Doctor Seo.

304
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,865
Why did you do it,

305
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,265
Ha Kyung?

306
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:12,505
Why did you...

307
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,045
do that to me?

308
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:23,220
Why?

309
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,455
Why do you break my heart?

310
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,425
I gave you all my heart.

311
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,795
I gave you my everything.

312
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,935
But why did you...

313
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:45,480
Why did you betray me and make me miserable?

314
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,235
Why?

315
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,945
Why did you do that to me?

316
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:51,980
Why...

317
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:54,515
Why?

318
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,155
Doctor Seo.

319
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:38,530
I'm sorry.

320
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,075
Your wife...

321
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:32,645
must've loved you dearly.

322
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,515
It's impossible...

323
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,885
not to love you.

324
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:41,815
You...

325
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:46,655
deserve to be loved.

326
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,895
I don't know what exactly happened,

327
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,265
but I'm sure...

328
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,535
it wasn't because she didn't love you.

329
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,595
(Episode 24)

330
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,405
(Ha Seong Ho)

331
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,785
Darn it.

332
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,760
Seong Ho.

333
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:58,325
You can't avoid me forever.

334
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,655
You're dead meat.

335
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,795
Why are you already here?

336
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:10,070
I asked you for lunch.

337
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:12,235
I couldn't wait to find out...

338
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,135
how my bomb exploded.

339
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,945
Have a seat first.

340
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,415
I'm sorry.

341
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:31,185
He was already aware of it.

342
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:32,860
He already knew?

343
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,395
Yes.

344
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:36,765
He knew everything...

345
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:38,865
about Ha Kyung's affair.

346
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:41,935
But he chose to stay by her side.

347
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,335
He's so foolish,

348
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,335
isn't he?

349
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:49,305
He isn't foolish. He's crazy.

350
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,145
Unlike how you expected,

351
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,945
there isn't any crack between them.

352
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:59,390
I asked you to come so we could talk about something more constructive...

353
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,285
than digging into someone else's marriage.

354
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,425
The condition on our contract...

355
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,655
has to be carried through.

356
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,165
It's about the paintings for your new hotel.

357
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:13,435
It's time you make an order.

358
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,705
How many paintings will be enough?

359
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:17,710
That's right.

360
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,235
There you go.

361
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:23,075
You're finally giving me a few pieces of the puzzle.

362
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:26,115
And I knew you'd bring it up.

363
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:34,820
(100,000 dollars)

364
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,530
It's the down payment...

365
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:38,025
for 10 paintings.

366
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:42,125
- Down payment? - Once they're complete,

367
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,825
I'll pay 10 times the amount.

368
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:46,535
But I have one condition.

369
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,295
I want them...

370
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:50,405
to be painted by the artist of "A Self-Portrait".

371
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,905
I already told you.

372
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,850
The artist is out of reach.

373
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:02,785
I know she's around you somewhere.

374
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:07,315
Find her if you want the money.

375
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:10,785
Don't forget to check right under your nose.

376
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,725
Oh, right.

377
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,125
It'd be even better if you've already found her.

378
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:27,480
Mr. Kim Jong Woo's surgery is scheduled at 3pm.

379
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,975
And you have surgery at 9am, 1pm, 4pm tomorrow.

380
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:33,915
Doctor Seo?

381
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:37,485
Did you hear me?

382
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,415
I'm sorry,

383
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,090
but can you leave a note about today's schedule?

384
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,225
Okay.

385
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:50,465
So you do get distracted sometimes...

386
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,370
even with your focus...

387
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,170
that helps you absorb...

388
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,405
like a powerful vacuum cleaner.

389
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:58,110
Shut it.

390
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,040
This is unbelievable.

391
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:02,110
Stop hitting on me during working hours.

392
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:04,250
- What are you talking about? - All right.

393
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:06,420
Let's get to work.

394
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:08,145
- Okay. - Okay.

395
00:35:14,596 --> 00:35:17,485
Doctor Seo is feeling a bit down today.

396
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,555
- Move. - Gosh, that was one intense touch.

397
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:39,045
Let me finish my scheduled surgeries before leaving.

398
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,475
Give me some time.

399
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,835
(Seo Jung Won)

400
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:17,485
(100,000 dollars)

401
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,990
Most new artists will never get paid this much down payment.

402
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:25,930
They want 10 paintings.

403
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,425
Who...

404
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,465
ordered the paintings?

405
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,735
If it's Kang In Wook, I won't do it.

406
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:39,735
You aren't in the place to be picky right now.

407
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:42,905
Be wise.

408
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:45,080
You won't be using your real name anyway.

409
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:49,285
And I'll never tell him that you drew the paintings.

410
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:52,320
I came here to see you...

411
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,690
because you wanted to discuss something about Doctor Seo.

412
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,385
This issue is related to him too.

413
00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:00,330
In order for him to be safe,

414
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:03,025
you must leave.

415
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,495
You need money to leave.

416
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:10,540
And to earn money, you should paint.

417
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:13,240
Take this chance...

418
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:15,505
to get a house and live with your mother there.

419
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:19,775
Get her out of the nursing home and take care of her yourself.

420
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,725
Thank you for your concern.

421
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:32,125
I'll be off.

422
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,695
Take the money.

423
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:42,465
And consider it.

424
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:46,240
Kang In Wook's money...

425
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,910
may help you escape from him.

426
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:52,875
I'll escape on my own.

427
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,455
(Ha Seong Ho)

428
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:13,500
Why did you ignore my calls, Seong Ho?

429
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,695
Well, I'm calling you now.

430
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,905
All right, let's meet up.

431
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:22,645
I didn't run away. Can't you be patient a little?

432
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,295
Excuse me.

433
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,295
You're Yoon Ma Ri, right?

434
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,835
I'm Ha Seong Ho, Doctor Seo's friend.

435
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:57,245
I know the original owner...

436
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,275
of your face.

437
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,265
Back in college,

438
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,205
Ha Kyung was like Venus among the male students.

439
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,775
To win her heart,

440
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:29,445
three men competed against each other.

441
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,545
One day,

442
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:35,815
she suggested a game.

443
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:41,215
She held three flowers like this...

444
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:43,555
and told us to pick one each.

445
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:48,355
She said she'd marry the one with the longest flower.

446
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,295
The winner was...

447
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,265
Jung Won.

448
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,305
As if she was joking,

449
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:01,105
she said she'd marry him.

450
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,505
And it actually...

451
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:06,775
came true.

452
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,915
Why are you...

453
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:14,060
telling me this story?

454
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:16,125
Because you're the only one...

455
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:19,525
who can comfort him right now.

456
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,895
Why do you think he changed your face...

457
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:26,765
into that of his late wife?

458
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:28,795
I think...

459
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:31,305
it was because...

460
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,775
he wanted her back.

461
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,875
So love him...

462
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:44,415
on Ha Kyung's behalf.

463
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:27,025
I'd like to go somewhere with you.

464
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,115
Pick one.

465
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:56,725
Among these three,

466
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,025
find the longest stem.

467
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,095
You will...

468
00:42:34,602 --> 00:42:38,995
always pick the longest one.

469
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,895
Because I'll make it happen that way.

470
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,515
I'll leave your stem as is...

471
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,985
and cut the other two out like this.

472
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,855
Women...

473
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:11,465
never leave their life up to a flower stem.

474
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:13,835
In any case,

475
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:17,035
they choose the one they love.

476
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:19,905
Your wife...

477
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:22,040
loved you.

478
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:23,705
Please stop...

479
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:26,975
talking about my wife.

480
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:30,485
Seeing your face...

481
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:33,915
is already difficult...

482
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,285
for me.

483
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:43,295
I'm sorry.

484
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,395
But I'm...

485
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:50,605
not your wife.

486
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:58,375
What kind of face...

487
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,120
should I make...

488
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:05,185
when I see you?

489
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:08,855
I'm not your wife,

490
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,195
so tell me.

491
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:19,295
How do you want me to face you?

492
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:14,685
I prepared some nice dishes to cheer you on.

493
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,825
I think you better...

494
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:23,195
move out.

495
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:29,065
Hae Ra got a studio the other day.

496
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:33,175
Live there.

497
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,705
Ever since he was little,

498
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,580
he would bring birds with broken wings...

499
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:42,675
and stray cats home.

500
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:47,315
I think you're a similar case for him.

501
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:53,025
If you were going to be like this,

502
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,295
why did you let me in your house in the first place?

503
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:58,395
Why did you stop me...

504
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:00,895
back at the train station?

505
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:03,565
Tell me.

506
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,375
I'm not an abandoned cat.

507
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,185
It was right...

508
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:21,455
that I leave.

509
00:46:22,897 --> 00:46:25,325
You say it's unbearable to see my face,

510
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,395
so I'll leave.

511
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,465
Women...

512
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,580
never leave their life...

513
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,175
up to a flower stem.

514
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,075
In any case,

515
00:47:20,554 --> 00:47:23,215
they choose the one they love.

516
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:26,555
So I bought another ticket...

517
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:29,630
and waited for the next train.

518
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,625
I might have wished...

519
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:36,095
you'd come and find me...

520
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:39,095
before the train arrived.

521
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,085
What kind of face...

522
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:01,115
should I make when I see you?

523
00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:11,065
I'm not your wife.

524
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,360
And when the wife...

525
00:48:38,365 --> 00:48:41,555
runs away from home after a fight,

526
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:45,165
her husband would go out barefoot to find her.

527
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:48,565
Barefoot is a bit too risky.

528
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:17,660
He's so heartbroken that he hurt his wife.

529
00:50:17,664 --> 00:50:20,025
That's why he forgets that he's barefoot.

530
00:50:48,996 --> 00:50:53,125
They say one's face reflects their soul.

531
00:50:54,168 --> 00:50:56,225
Why did...

532
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:58,265
the owner of this face...

533
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:01,565
have such a merciless soul?

534
00:51:05,012 --> 00:51:06,805
Change...

535
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,275
my face again.

536
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:13,345
To a different face from this.

537
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:29,725
When the Endless Sorrow Douses My Heart.

538
00:51:41,582 --> 00:51:44,345
(Love in Sadness)

539
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,375
Woo Ha Kyung is dead?

540
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:49,920
Then...

541
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:51,590
who are you?

542
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,360
Who are you?

543
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,490
Are you saying you'll meet with Kang In Wook?

544
00:51:55,496 --> 00:51:57,990
He might kill you, Ma Ri.

545
00:51:57,998 --> 00:51:59,930
Ma Ri. Ma Ri.

546
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,100
Ma Ri.

547
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:02,625
Goodbye.

548
00:52:02,836 --> 00:52:05,065
Thank you for everything.
