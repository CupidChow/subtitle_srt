1
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,225
Loving you...

2
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,355
was the easiest thing...

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,725
to do in my life.

4
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,495
Because...

5
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:27,595
it's hard not to love you.

6
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:37,605
But now,

7
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,215
it'll be the hardest thing...

8
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,915
because I can express my love only by turning away.

9
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,525
Only by leaving you,

10
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,985
I can love you.

11
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:59,425
(Episode 31: Hopeless Love)

12
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,245
We shouldn't leave him like that.

13
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,590
Call Ms. Joo.

14
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,815
Let her know where Doctor Seo is.

15
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:32,695
(Calling Vice-Director Joo)

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,810
Did you meet Jung Won?

17
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:43,545
Where is he?

18
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,850
Moojin-si?

19
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,785
Where in the city?

20
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,025
What was that...

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,595
you talked about, holding my hand?

22
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:12,335
Don't try to fool me.

23
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,635
Your eyes...

24
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,145
tell me everything.

25
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:19,805
And don't...

26
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,845
mention the name, Seo Jung Won,

27
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,845
ever again.

28
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,055
What I want...

29
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,785
is for him...

30
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,255
to be dead for good.

31
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,165
(Secretary Kim)

32
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,210
What is it?

33
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,580
The chairman wishes to see you, sir.

34
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,275
He wants to go see your wife in the hospital right away.

35
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,220
What about the doctor?

36
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,590
I found a medical team who said it's possible,

37
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,290
but the situation isn't easy to schedule a date.

38
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,660
They want to perform it after three months.

39
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,185
Three months?

40
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,625
Three months?

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,025
Even three days is late enough.

42
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,195
You know my father wants to see her.

43
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,965
Make them come by any means.

44
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,005
Offer whatever conditions to make them come.

45
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,445
No. No!

46
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,145
Late. It's late!

47
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,315
Tell them to come for now.

48
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:37,025
Money...

49
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,255
isn't a problem, okay?

50
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,925
Contact them again.

51
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,775
Ma Ri.

52
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,015
Ma Ri!

53
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,435
Jung Won.

54
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,475
Jung Won.

55
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,315
Is anyone here?

56
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,815
Are you okay?

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,985
Why did you do it?

58
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,560
Why?

59
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,455
You almost died!

60
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,495
My heart...

61
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,535
belongs to me.

62
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:03,635
You can't do what you want with it.

63
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,145
You'll have to...

64
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,915
be satisfied with my soulless body.

65
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:19,260
If you attempt to hurt somebody again,

66
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,695
then you...

67
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,325
won't be able to have...

68
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,625
even this body.

69
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,705
Ma Ri...

70
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:56,725
Jung Won.

71
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,200
Why is it...

72
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,270
that you always end up with heartbreaking love?

73
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,065
Others fall in love and break up easily,

74
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,675
so why do you...

75
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,875
have to suffer every time you love someone?

76
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,245
Can't it be easy?

77
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,785
Can't you...

78
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,315
go for easier love now?

79
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,985
My goodness.

80
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,270
Do you like it?

81
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,895
Yes, I love it.

82
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:09,165
Jung Won, are you okay?

83
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,005
What happened?

84
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,305
Why did you go to Moojin?

85
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,580
Kang In Wook told me you were there,

86
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,975
and you were unconscious alone when I got there.

87
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,220
What on earth happened?

88
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,945
Did he do this to you?

89
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,790
You need to rest.

90
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:31,660
Please lie back down. Don't try to do anything.

91
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,085
I must go.

92
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:37,365
Ma Ri went with Kang In Wook to protect me.

93
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:39,925
That's enough, Jung Won.

94
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,695
Let her go now.

95
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,965
Bury her in your heart.

96
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:49,935
Live as if nothing happened.

97
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:59,115
I'm done with waiting for someone...

98
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,515
who's not going to come back.

99
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:07,595
The woman I love is being tormented right now.

100
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,865
My heart is breaking apart.

101
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,525
What are you going to do?

102
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,395
I need to get her back.

103
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:18,565
Jung...

104
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,445
Mother.

105
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,845
How was your night?

106
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,285
Did you eat breakfast?

107
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,455
Who are you?

108
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,055
It's me.

109
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,425
Don't you recognize me?

110
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,595
You're the scary mister.

111
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,020
Mom, I'm here.

112
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,520
My daughter.

113
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,115
She recognizes her daughter with a different face,

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,685
but not her son-in-law.

115
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:17,000
How are you feeling? Are you feeling okay?

116
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:18,425
Yes.

117
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,765
Mother.

118
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:29,335
Now that Ma Ri is here, let us take you to our house.

119
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,605
We'll take good care of you there.

120
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:35,875
But...

121
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,945
didn't you come with my son-in-law today?

122
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:44,185
Mother, I'm right here.

123
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,630
No.

124
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:50,155
You aren't my son-in-law.

125
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,465
- Mom. - Who gave you this...

126
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,180
- Give it back. - this handkerchief?

127
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,740
It's mine. Give it back to me.

128
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:03,005
It's from my son-in-law.

129
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,480
My son-in-law gave it to me.

130
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,920
- Mother, use this. - Give it back.

131
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,820
No! I want mine back.

132
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:14,030
I want mine!

133
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,090
Give it back to me!

134
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,760
- Give it back. - Here.

135
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,060
It's here.

136
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,655
Unbelievable.

137
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:42,375
- How did you know this place? - Because I'm her son-in-law.

138
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:46,320
Not the handkerchief man who pretends to be her son-in-law.

139
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,990
Go back. I'll take care of her on my own.

140
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,525
You...

141
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:55,025
didn't forget about hiding your mother...

142
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,340
while you were running away from me with a different face.

143
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,795
So I...

144
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:01,995
didn't forget about finding her whereabouts...

145
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,665
while I was desperately...

146
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,835
looking for you.

147
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,435
Do you understand me?

148
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,905
I never miss...

149
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,275
even the slightest weakness of yours.

150
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,720
I told you. I have nothing to be afraid of.

151
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,055
Yes, you do.

152
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,985
You have your dear mother...

153
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,385
right there.

154
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,865
I'm going to take her soon.

155
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:36,065
So don't even think of running out into the middle of the street.

156
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:37,805
Don't you...

157
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,905
die in front of me like someone.

158
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,005
If you do that again,

159
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,505
your mother...

160
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,545
will end up dying alone in an unfamiliar place...

161
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,445
without any friends or family.

162
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,315
All right.

163
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,995
I'll live as you want...

164
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,155
but under one condition.

165
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:04,895
My mom...

166
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,325
and...

167
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,665
Doctor Seo.

168
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,565
Don't hurt them.

169
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,905
When you got married,

170
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,975
you just had one condition.

171
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,115
Tell me if you're not happy with it.

172
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,155
I'm not...

173
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,055
afraid of anything.

174
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,565
How may I help you?

175
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:44,380
I'm here to see President Kang.

176
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,265
- He isn't home. - I know he is.

177
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,480
Mr. Kang wants us to keep a strict guard on the house.

178
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:53,305
- Where is he? - At the sanatorium.

179
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,285
I'll be back soon, Mom.

180
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:02,315
Don't go. Don't go.

181
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,595
Everything is going to be fine.

182
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:09,700
Don't go.

183
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,225
Nothing is going to happen. Everything will be all right.

184
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,415
Let's go.

185
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,275
We're finally back...

186
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,135
to our house.

187
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,275
It's all right.

188
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,245
We're home.

189
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:56,795
The bedroom...

190
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,735
and your workroom.

191
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,235
Everything is the same as they were.

192
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,705
I'll give you...

193
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,315
your face back too.

194
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,685
We better keep this from my father until then.

195
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,915
He won't let us get away with it if he finds out.

196
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:20,985
Ma Ri.

197
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,765
I...

198
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,605
am so happy...

199
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,835
to have you back.

200
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,845
We can...

201
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:39,880
go back to before.

202
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:41,415
Don't worry.

203
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,845
I'll make that happen.

204
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,545
I'm tired.

205
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,315
I want to be alone.

206
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,555
Okay.

207
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:59,125
It was such a long journey after all.

208
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:03,895
I'll let you rest.

209
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,375
Excuse me.

210
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,420
Hello. Do you remember me?

211
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,245
We met back when Ms. Jung went missing.

212
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,415
Yes, I do.

213
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,370
She said she was Ms. Jung's friend,

214
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:11,640
but it turned out she was her daughter.

215
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,940
I don't know why she changed her entire face,

216
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,005
but things were crazy with her husband coming here and all.

217
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,355
Your food is ready.

218
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,555
What is...

219
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,355
your name?

220
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,540
Call me as you like.

221
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,095
Do you...

222
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,310
work for my husband?

223
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,605
That's right.

224
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:52,875
You chased,

225
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,915
caught,

226
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,175
and are watching over me,

227
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,415
but I'm the victim...

228
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:04,925
who ran away from her husband to survive.

229
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,655
Please...

230
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,565
help me.

231
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,495
All my married life,

232
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,935
I shivered in fear...

233
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:21,675
under my husband's abuse.

234
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,935
And I've been dragged back here.

235
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,615
I'll help you.

236
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,745
Do you mean it?

237
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,690
I know that you ran away from home...

238
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,325
after suffering from depression and delusion.

239
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,125
My mission...

240
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,565
is to protect you and keep you safe.

241
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,695
I'll do my best to help you, ma'am.

242
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,185
Don't worry.

243
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:14,485
I'm not running away again.

244
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,925
To be happy with you,

245
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,925
I'm mustering up my courage.

246
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,945
What's wrong with you?

247
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,920
Did you discuss this with Doctor Seo?

248
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,030
Don't you think this is too sudden?

249
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,415
You can't leave the hospital like this.

250
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:46,630
I've earned my reputation thanks to him.

251
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:48,230
Isn't it time to start something of my own?

252
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,655
No.

253
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,965
It's not even close...

254
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:59,065
Anyway, please take good care of Seo and Ha Plastic Surgery...

255
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,865
without Ha.

256
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,510
Seo and Ha Plastic Surgery without Ha.

257
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:04,535
Wouldn't it be Only Seo Plastic Surgery then?

258
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,785
(Kang In Wook)

259
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,125
I'm going to resign from the hospital...

260
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:25,065
and move outside the city.

261
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,335
So stop asking for me.

262
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:30,965
I came to tell you that.

263
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,135
Outside the city?

264
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,805
Yes.

265
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:38,145
The owner of the hospital fired me...

266
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,675
thanks to someone.

267
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,450
Did you think you'd keep working with him?

268
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,275
What you did is quite grave.

269
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,645
Coveting his wife.

270
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,715
This is why...

271
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,260
Doctor Seo has to get punished...

272
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:54,155
just like you.

273
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:57,855
I won't get myself involved in this anymore.

274
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,325
I'll be gone as of today.

275
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,495
Are we done now?

276
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:09,535
You aren't dropping out alone.

277
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,520
This is just the beginning.

278
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,205
Have you forgotten?

279
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,075
You're responsible for Woo Ha Kyung's death.

280
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,145
Keep working at the hospital...

281
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,215
and do what I tell you to do...

282
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,555
if you don't want to lose your medical certificate.

283
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:29,025
Then Doctor Ha,

284
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:31,400
shall we start talking about...

285
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,125
Doctor Seo now?

286
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,440
It's said...

287
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:55,410
when sailors were lost,

288
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:59,205
they used its scent to find their way.

289
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:03,750
That's why my dad got my name, Ma Ri,

290
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,645
from rosemary.

291
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,015
It's a nice name.

292
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,215
I wish you don't get lost in life...

293
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,685
like the meaning of your name.

294
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,550
Until when...

295
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,505
do you think you can run away...

296
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,005
like a scared puppy?

297
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,720
Show me your wife right now.

298
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,485
If she's in a coma, bring her in the bed.

299
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,025
If she's dead, bring her body.

300
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,560
I want to see her right now.

301
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,930
She...

302
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:50,155
hasn't fully recovered yet.

303
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,900
She's giving it all she's got,

304
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,995
so please wait just a little longer, Father.

305
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:08,005
Your lies...

306
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,360
never work on me.

307
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,115
When you were little and even now,

308
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,715
you haven't changed one bit.

309
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,085
I'll greet you with her...

310
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,760
as soon as possible.

311
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,355
Your mother killed herself leaving you behind...

312
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,925
because you're no better than this.

313
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,065
I see.

314
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,285
Stay outside.

315
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,460
Mom!

316
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,965
(Episode 32)

317
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:25,115
I can finally breathe now.

318
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,485
Seeing you waiting here...

319
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:31,455
for me,

320
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,755
I can finally breathe.

321
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,465
For us to go back...

322
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,165
to how things were,

323
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:21,510
we need more time.

324
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:23,005
What?

325
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,675
"Time"?

326
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:28,845
Then what does that say about the time I spent looking for you?

327
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,945
All that you can say...

328
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,715
after coming back to me with that unfamiliar face is...

329
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:38,115
that you need time?

330
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:41,655
You're always asking for more time.

331
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,765
Please...

332
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:49,035
don't provoke me.

333
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,765
Can't you see that I'm desperately holding back?

334
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,005
Don't give me that look...

335
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,015
with that unfamiliar face of yours.

336
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,345
It makes me scared...

337
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,855
that I won't be able to get back the Ma Ri I love so dearly.

338
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,655
During our entire marriage life,

339
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:17,195
you never once saw...

340
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,895
the real me.

341
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:30,305
You're right.

342
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,075
You must need time.

343
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,875
Come in.

344
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:11,015
I still have some patients to tend to.

345
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,215
Give me a bit more time.

346
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,685
Sure.

347
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,785
Also,

348
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:22,555
you know that...

349
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:25,425
I was the one who told Kang In Wook...

350
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,525
that Ha Kyung's dead, right?

351
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,010
I was threatened.

352
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:34,635
That man is completely insane.

353
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,135
I just wanted to live.

354
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:40,375
What did he threaten you with?

355
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:47,485
You know already.

356
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:50,215
He knows about...

357
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,085
Ha Kyung and me.

358
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,085
On top of that,

359
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:57,555
he knew that I had a family...

360
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,965
who kept asking me to get money from you.

361
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,835
He knew everything about me.

362
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:08,205
I'm not asking for your understanding.

363
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,735
Moreover, you don't need to forgive me.

364
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,975
Just cut to the chase.

365
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:15,615
Be careful.

366
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,615
It's not that...

367
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,885
he can't kill you.

368
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,385
It's just that...

369
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,860
he's sparing you for now...

370
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,525
because of a certain reason.

371
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,425
He knows...

372
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:32,300
that you're the only one who can give Ms. Yoon...

373
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,765
her original face back.

374
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,210
If it's because of your patients,

375
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:38,440
you can stay here longer.

376
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:39,905
However,

377
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,710
make sure you wrap up soon.

378
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,635
This is the best I can do.

379
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,220
I thought you were packing, so why are you still here?

380
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:51,590
You even said you got a new job.

381
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:54,485
What can I do when my patients want me to do the surgeries?

382
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:00,655
I've talked with the lawyer whom you've mentioned.

383
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:06,625
Let's talk outside.

384
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,105
We need more solid evidence...

385
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:22,120
than Ma Ri's testimony?

386
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:26,145
Wealthy families make sure not to expose their mistakes.

387
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:30,355
I'm sure she wasn't able to get a single medical certificate.

388
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,655
And we probably won't be able to get anyone else to testify.

389
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,325
But she was willing to go under the knife in order to be free.

390
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,405
That argument won't be of any advantage to her.

391
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,465
They will...

392
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,575
only expose the fact...

393
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:52,845
that the doctor offered to make her look...

394
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,345
like his own wife.

395
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,685
There must be something I can do.

396
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:05,685
The only solution...

397
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:10,755
is for her to acquire new evidence and flee his house.

398
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:13,095
"Evidence"?

399
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,465
The proof of his abuse.

400
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,435
Broken bones.

401
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:22,205
Torn skin.

402
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:25,805
The bluish and reddish bruises.

403
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,975
Do you want that?

404
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,285
No.

405
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,195
She can never go through...

406
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,355
such pain again.

407
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,545
My son.

408
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:10,930
What are you doing here?

409
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:12,955
It's time for your class.

410
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:17,025
What? I think Ma Ri is back.

411
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,835
What do you mean?

412
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:34,645
I think I was mistaken.

413
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,810
Seo Jung Won is seeing a divorce lawyer?

414
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:01,180
That's correct.

415
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,475
He specializes in divorces related to domestic violence.

416
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:07,375
(Lawyer Kim Seok Min)

417
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:08,805
Is that so?

418
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,815
I'd like to have a word with you.

419
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,155
Could you spare me some time?

420
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,205
Your house looks the same.

421
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,685
May I look around your garden?

422
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:30,555
Ma Ri told me...

423
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:33,595
that your garden on the balcony was amazing.

424
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:35,635
She also said...

425
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:40,165
that thanks to the many flowers and herbs,

426
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,175
she could breathe in peace.

427
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:51,245
So we're planning to make our own garden.

428
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,700
What are you doing while confining her in your house?

429
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,595
"Confining"?

430
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:07,270
We're living happily.

431
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:09,135
Let her go.

432
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:12,805
If not, I will sue you for domestic violence.

433
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,735
Ma Ri,

434
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,575
my wife,

435
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:21,575
is suffering from depression.

436
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,175
So at times, she believes in things...

437
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:27,815
that don't even happen.

438
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,055
Why would you claim her to be insane when she's not?

439
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:32,930
What are you scheming?

440
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,185
Many people have been deceived by her.

441
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:37,195
Such as myself...

442
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,165
and you.

443
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,635
During our entire marriage life,

444
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:49,575
she caused many issues.

445
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:53,220
You're the one with issues.

446
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,620
When her depression was bad...

447
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:57,690
- Mr. Kang... - No matter how much I tried...

448
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,390
You should know since you're a doctor.

449
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:00,620
Such people are so lost...

450
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:04,085
in their own thoughts that no matter how much you explain to them,

451
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,860
they just won't listen.

452
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,595
Do you actually think I'll believe that?

453
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:12,055
Fine.

454
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,425
It doesn't matter.

455
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:18,135
This is a matter between her and me.

456
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,480
It has nothing to do with you.

457
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,135
No, it does.

458
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,575
That's because...

459
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,545
- I... - Stop.

460
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:35,615
Stop.

461
00:38:37,265 --> 00:38:38,785
That's enough.

462
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,525
I came here...

463
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,340
to say thank you.

464
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,365
I want to thank you...

465
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,265
for taking care...

466
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:53,435
of my sick wife.

467
00:38:54,048 --> 00:38:57,705
I heard you're seeing a divorce lawyer.

468
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:00,080
If you're trying to split us up by making up rumors...

469
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,475
such as that she's suffering from domestic violence,

470
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:05,345
don't do that, okay?

471
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,485
Because...

472
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:09,685
even at this moment,

473
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:13,885
I'd love...

474
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,795
to strangle you...

475
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:19,825
for marring my wife's face.

476
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:22,565
But I'm desperately holding back...

477
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,995
for Ma Ri.

478
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,765
Because she doesn't want that to happen.

479
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,005
Do as you wish.

480
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:35,545
But who will believe a doctor...

481
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:38,615
who kidnapped someone else's wife...

482
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,515
and made her look like his dead wife?

483
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,680
What is it?

484
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:08,675
The madam would like to drop by her workroom in Hongi-dong.

485
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:10,920
Why?

486
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:14,615
There's something there that she needs.

487
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:19,225
Accompany her.

488
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,025
And make sure my family doesn't see her.

489
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,095
Watch him...

490
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:31,665
and see if he goes to meet her.

491
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:33,910
- Yes, sir. - I've wanted...

492
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:36,435
to know the truth...

493
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,875
behind their relationship anyway.

494
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,650
Please, wait here.

495
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,035
Let me gather my belongings.

496
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,865
Where did the rosemary pot go?

497
00:42:57,692 --> 00:43:00,985
(I don't know when you'll return and read this...)

498
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,390
Dr. Seo Jung Won is here.

499
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,545
- What should I do? - He's there?

500
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,885
So he's there.

501
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:14,025
Are you all right?

502
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,625
Are you hurt?

503
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:38,515
I'm sorry to say this,

504
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:42,185
but I'm thinking about...

505
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:44,485
giving him another chance.

506
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,055
- Ma Ri. - He also promised...

507
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:53,065
to do his best.

508
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:57,065
We both agreed to try harder.

509
00:44:58,379 --> 00:45:00,065
So...

510
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,435
let's end it here.

511
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:11,515
I don't believe that.

512
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:14,785
Be honest.

513
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,855
Something's going on, right?

514
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,025
- What is it? - I hope...

515
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:24,595
we never see each other again.

516
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:56,800
I'll go home alone.

517
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:58,825
I want to walk for a bit.

518
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,595
- I don't think... - Should I ask...

519
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:03,995
my husband for his permission?

520
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,935
Okay.

521
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:19,575
It's rosemary.

522
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:24,275
You said its scent helped sailors find their way in the ocean.

523
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,445
You said it was also called the Drops of the Ocean.

524
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:30,155
You should also be like them.

525
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:33,225
No matter how hard it is,

526
00:47:34,168 --> 00:47:36,055
don't stray away from the path.

527
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:46,635
No matter the situation,

528
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:48,805
be courageous...

529
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,535
and don't lose hope.

530
00:47:54,154 --> 00:47:55,705
Until...

531
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,615
I find you once again,

532
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:10,425
don't get hurt...

533
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:17,135
or sick.

534
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,885
Also,

535
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:45,325
if you face danger...

536
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:48,825
or if it's unbearable,

537
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,265
run to me.

538
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:53,535
I'll be waiting with open arms.

539
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:35,345
I have no choice but to turn away from you.

540
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:38,615
I have no choice but to let you go.

541
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:43,585
But I love you.

542
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:47,430
Hopeless Love.

543
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:50,055
(Hopeless Love)

544
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:03,550
(Love in Sadness)

545
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,480
So you'll betray Jung Won once again?

546
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:08,350
I'm already a sinner.

547
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:11,020
Aren't you happy? You'll be getting your face back.

548
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:12,720
I have a good feeling about the surgery.

549
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:14,385
Kang In Wook!

550
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,360
Kang In Wook!

551
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:18,560
Ma Ri, I'd rather die...

552
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:20,060
than say goodbye.

553
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:21,730
Don't do it!

554
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:23,155
Stop!

555
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:38,710
Even after 10 years...

556
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,150
or 100 years,

557
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:42,680
- Hoorah! - you will all pay...

558
00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:44,550
for your sins.

559
00:50:44,558 --> 00:50:46,190
I'm going to ask them...

560
00:50:46,193 --> 00:50:48,345
why they betrayed our country.

561
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:51,855
You bring death with you.

562
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:54,130
I'm going to protect Kim Won Bong,

563
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,755
the leader of the Heroic Corps.

564
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:59,695
("Different Dreams")
