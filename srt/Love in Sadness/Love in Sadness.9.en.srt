1
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:32,740
Hi, Ma Ri.

2
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:35,105
Hello. I want to give it a go.

3
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,235
Really?

4
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:41,220
Good thinking.

5
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,605
I know...

6
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,515
he won't be fooled by a clumsy act.

7
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,715
I want to prepare for it thoroughly.

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,900
Send me the information about Ms. Woo.

9
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:53,470
Okay, I'll send you the information about the gallery...

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,670
and on recent trends in the art field.

11
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,970
And also I'll send you a list of paintings...

12
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,340
that Gunha Group will be interested in.

13
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,965
I just need the information about the gallery and Ms. Woo.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,580
I already know the trends in the art field,

15
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:07,165
and about his liking,

16
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,435
I'm well aware of it.

17
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:12,905
You must be.

18
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,045
Okay then.

19
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:43,675
(Episode 17: I've Been Bewitched by Love)

20
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,610
Did you get the laptop that I sent you?

21
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,905
The documents are all in there.

22
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:20,850
Also, the meeting is at 3pm.

23
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:24,145
Come by 2pm, so we can prepare beforehand.

24
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,155
We look so alike.

25
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:07,255
We're almost the same person.

26
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,180
Let's monitor the necrosis...

27
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:27,805
and set another surgery date.

28
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,675
All right.

29
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,415
By the way,

30
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,055
I decided to work here just because of you.

31
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:43,000
The others think I did it because of the money,

32
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,440
but that's not true.

33
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,540
I told them that I will become your partner.

34
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:50,495
I was very confident and...

35
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,405
We need to talk.

36
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:01,890
Is he here again?

37
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:03,305
No.

38
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,375
Even if he does,

39
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,190
don't meet him.

40
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:09,860
I'll contact him and meet in person.

41
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,415
I talked with your mom,

42
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,925
and she said you'll visit her.

43
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,095
I should go.

44
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,525
Are you going...

45
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,925
to tell her?

46
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,265
How much are you going to tell her?

47
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,375
I'll be back.

48
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:36,905
Be safe.

49
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:39,345
Tell her I miss her.

50
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,755
Can I go there dressed like...

51
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,365
Ms. Woo?

52
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,295
The employees here don't know her face.

53
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:05,280
Dr. Ha is the only one who knew her,

54
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:07,350
but he'll be busy working.

55
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:10,445
Jung Won will be away as well.

56
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:15,285
"Hello, I'm Woo Ha Kyung."

57
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,855
No.

58
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,205
"I'm Woo Ha Kyung."

59
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,215
The number and address to a hair salon are written.

60
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,645
Pick your clothes, and get your hair done there.

61
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,435
I bought the same wedding ring as Ha Kyung's.

62
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,855
You're here early.

63
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,565
Don't be afraid.

64
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,965
You're not Yoon Ma Ri now.

65
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,905
You're not Yoon Ma Ri.

66
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:37,580
I didn't touch your bedroom...

67
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,805
since her belongings were still there.

68
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,990
Your albums are in here...

69
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,060
as well as your poems and books.

70
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,545
Take them.

71
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,825
You lost so much weight.

72
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,310
I know it's hard.

73
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:04,880
But what can we do?

74
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:08,105
We need to be strong and move on.

75
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:12,580
If you still haven't let go of her,

76
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,105
you need to stop.

77
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:17,045
Stubbornly holding on isn't always love.

78
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,285
Letting go is also a form of love.

79
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,335
Finally,

80
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,450
I got the chance to meet you.

81
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:21,175
I've been focusing on my personal work.

82
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,190
I apologize.

83
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,420
Before signing,

84
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,760
He asked for a few paintings for his lobby.

85
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:31,415
Show them to him, and then sign the contract.

86
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,470
This is a list of the recommended paintings for your lobby.

87
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,530
Please take a look.

88
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,995
I'd like to see the paintings myself.

89
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:41,865
They're on display, right?

90
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,275
This painting is...

91
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,375
Excuse me.

92
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,000
Excuse me.

93
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,730
You could've just looked at the documents.

94
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,925
I'd like to appreciate them in peace,

95
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,485
so vacate the area.

96
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,265
But...

97
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,680
How about we take a look after the customers...

98
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:20,710
are gone?

99
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,135
I think...

100
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,505
you should close for today.

101
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:27,235
I'll pay you a year's worth.

102
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:46,525
Well...

103
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,995
I'm very sorry.

104
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:53,510
The gallery has an emergency and will need to close for today.

105
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:55,680
Could you come back next time?

106
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,975
The exit is over there.

107
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,505
I apologize.

108
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:00,920
I'm sorry.

109
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,005
- Goodness. - Why suddenly?

110
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,745
Vice-Director Joo.

111
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,985
You should leave as well.

112
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:43,085
It's finally quiet now.

113
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,155
You can start.

114
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,445
What could it be that it's this hard for you to talk about?

115
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,225
I'm sorry.

116
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,625
I...

117
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,535
I did something very horrible.

118
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,515
This is the second piece that I recommended.

119
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,715
The composition and colors are unique.

120
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:55,825
It's been quite popular lately.

121
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,285
What...

122
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,515
did you say?

123
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:30,455
You did what with Ha Kyung's face?

124
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:44,005
How could you do such a thing?

125
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,075
Please forgive my son.

126
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,985
Please...

127
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,770
I've explained five pieces so far.

128
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,225
- Is this enough? - Please go on.

129
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:11,135
I need more pieces.

130
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,025
Do you know...

131
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,640
how beautiful your neckline is?

132
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,995
I'm the only one who can touch it.

133
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,185
Could you give it back?

134
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,105
Thank you.

135
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,185
Ha Kyung.

136
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:33,595
Ha Kyung.

137
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,805
On the day I buried you here,

138
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:39,935
I felt like...

139
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:43,205
my heart was being ripped apart.

140
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,455
I can't go out right now.

141
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:57,325
It's midnight. What are you saying?

142
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,755
Of course, I miss you.

143
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,565
But I can't go out right now.

144
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,280
You're being like a child.

145
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:07,495
Do you have to hear it?

146
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,605
Fine. I'll say it.

147
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,005
Honey.

148
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,445
Are you happy now?

149
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,815
I love you. Are you happy now?

150
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,515
My goodness.

151
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,415
I wanted to ask you...

152
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,055
who you were talking to.

153
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,255
I wanted to ask you what kind of relationship you had with him.

154
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:37,725
But I was afraid.

155
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,665
So I decided not to.

156
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,345
The excuse I wanted to hear from you...

157
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,515
and the hope of starting everything over...

158
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,085
were all buried here...

159
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,925
with you.

160
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,325
Ha Kyung.

161
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,535
The thing that hurts me,

162
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,165
Ha Kyung,

163
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,635
is that your face...

164
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,645
will let her hide.

165
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,485
I gave your face...

166
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,115
to her.

167
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,695
I still have so many things to say to you.

168
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,735
I still have so many things to do with you.

169
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,535
So I gave your face...

170
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:05,085
You saw all the paintings we have in the gallery.

171
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:07,385
That's it?

172
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:15,125
There aren't a lot of paintings than I expected.

173
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,265
I'm sorry about that.

174
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,635
Do you want to head to the office now?

175
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:24,835
One more thing.

176
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,705
I want to buy...

177
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,475
"A Self-Portrait" I saw last time.

178
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,930
I'm not sure which one you're referring to.

179
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,725
The self-portrait with the Cistus.

180
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:47,525
I believe the name of the artist...

181
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,065
was Leah.

182
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:56,865
It won the exhibition.

183
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,720
I don't think I can sell it.

184
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,880
I want to know more about that artist.

185
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,020
I can't keep in contact with the artist.

186
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,390
I'm sorry.

187
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:05,875
In that case,

188
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:15,255
Yoon Ma Ri,

189
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:17,925
I...

190
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,525
know.

191
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,165
I don't think...

192
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,350
there's an artist by that name.

193
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,375
That's the name of the artist I'm looking for.

194
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:37,145
Yoon...

195
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:39,575
Ma Ri.

196
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,615
If you know that artist...

197
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:44,915
personally,

198
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,615
we can try to reach her.

199
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,035
I'll try my best to protect her.

200
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,105
I'll try my best...

201
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,105
to let her live.

202
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:14,515
I don't want to...

203
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:17,845
regret anymore.

204
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,885
Your eyes are...

205
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,425
so dangerous.

206
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,695
Underneath the innocence,

207
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,965
they're filled with fear.

208
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:04,965
It includes...

209
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:07,665
betrayal...

210
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,865
which drives me crazy.

211
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:13,135
Your eyes look like...

212
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,445
you're planning to run away from me someday.

213
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,455
Before I came here,

214
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:32,125
I looked through your past activities and performance.

215
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:35,625
Usually, people sign their names on the contract,

216
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:38,095
but I see you brought a stamp instead.

217
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,880
I guess...

218
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:45,435
you like to thoroughly investigate before you sign a contract.

219
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:48,075
It's the key to a successful business.

220
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:50,990
The stamp is the first sculpture...

221
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:54,175
I made after I recovered.

222
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,115
It's very meaningful to me...

223
00:26:57,332 --> 00:27:00,155
as it feels like I'm starting my life again.

224
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:03,625
I can see that this contract...

225
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,525
is quite meaningful to you as well.

226
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,095
This stamp suits well with this contract.

227
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,480
Let's finalize the contract with a handshake.

228
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:25,620
Thank you again for the support Gunha Group...

229
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,980
will provide.

Tell me what you're hiding from me.

233

who I really am.

the fact that I'm looking for...

238
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:12,915
my wife, right?

239
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,025
- Yes. - I will...

240
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,855
find her...

241
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:23,995
regardless of where she is hiding.

242
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,795
Regardless of how she is hiding,

243
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:29,165
I will find her.

244
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,505
I hope you find her soon.

245
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:44,645
Sir, you have to head back to the company.

246
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:46,955
The chairman is looking for you.

248
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:55,925
you know my wife, please tell her that...

249
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:00,010
we'll see each other soon.

Look at these wrinkles.

00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,970
I should ask Dr. Ha for help.

254
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,495
That's ridiculous.

255
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,440
You better not do anything to that face.

256
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,470
My gosh. What's it to you?

257
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,135
Well... It's because you look so young to begin with.

258
00:31:40,015 --> 00:31:42,880
If looking young is a crime, you'll be sentenced to life.

Gosh, that's so corny.

260

Is Dr. Seo available right now?

261
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,485
He's out.

262
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,685

You and Dr. Seo are alumni and business partners, correct?

265
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,035
How much do you know...

266
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,235
about President Kang?

267
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:22,345
I know that he is one mysterious man.

268
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,445
Could you...

269
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,675
look into him for me?

I'm surprised that you know me. It's an honor.

What brings you here?

273
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:43,825
I came to see Dr. Seo, but he's out.

276
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,475

Good work. It's a success.

283
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,545
Are you okay?

284
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,045
I am.

285
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,415
You don't seem to be.

286
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,885
I'll take you home.

It's really fine.

288
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,135
I hope...

289
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,075
you won't need me to be...

290
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:01,205

291
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:12,155
I heard that you were the one who drew the Cistus painting.

292

Please, keep painting.

293

I'll sell them here.

294

I know you need to keep painting.

295
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,380
Since we know your situation,

296
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:33,735
we'll allow you to keep painting under your stage name.

297
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:44,485
I don't think that's a good idea.

298
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,845
If you went to the same school,

299
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:13,315
you must be close to him and his wife.

300
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,175
Of course.

301

This is quite disappointing.

310
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:53,730
We couldn't talk much.

311
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,385

317
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,030
I'll let you know after checking my schedule.

00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:42,425
I'll have to check my schedule as well.

All right, then.

We will.

322
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:56,680
You're much more handsome in person.

323
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:58,635
You have good skin as well.

324

I'll contact you soon.

Sure. It'll be my honor.

I haven't seen Dr. Seo. Did he go somewhere?

330
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,450
His afternoon schedule was empty, so he went to his mother's.

331

I see.

perform surgery on a VVIP without my knowing?

00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:15,495
Did you visit her?

344
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,640
You're back early.

345
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,895
I think it's best that I ask you...

346
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:22,095
why Ma Ri was here.

347
00:43:36,564 --> 00:43:38,215
If by any chance,

348
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,655
you know my wife, please tell her that...

349
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,225
we'll see each other soon.

350
00:44:10,665 --> 00:44:12,545
Once you get a place,

351
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,185
call me.

352
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:34,675
- Doctor... - Ha Kyung.

353
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:53,955
I had no choice.

354
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:55,840
I told you this was our only way.

355
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:58,195
No one benefits from this.

356
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,795
At least,

357
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:02,610
the gallery benefits from it.

358
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,165
I'm going to cancel the agreement.

359
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:08,905
- What? - Just know that.

360
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,505
To you, this gallery is nothing but a memory of Ha Kyung.

361
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:16,145
What about me?

362
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,285
After she got into that accident, no...

363
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:24,630
Ever since she told me that she was going to open...

364
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,025
a gallery under her name even though she knew nothing about it,

365
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:31,765
I was the one who sacrificed everything to run this gallery.

366
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:34,195
Sure.

367
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:36,950
This place must be a beautiful memory for you.

368
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,565
But for me...

369
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:42,805
For me,

370
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,845
this is my life.

371
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:52,185
Still, you shouldn't have used her.

372
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:54,215
Why not?

373
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:57,330
Ha Kyung's face saved her life.

374
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,300
So what's the big problem about acting like her for a brief moment?

375
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:01,095
Hae Ra, listen.

376
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:04,995
You risked someone's life just so we could live.

377
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,765
I don't want to be disappointed in you anymore.

378
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,705
You...

379
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:17,145
You were always on my side.

380
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:21,615
Why have you changed?

381
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:25,745
What is she to you?

382
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:29,255
Tell me.

383
00:46:29,837 --> 00:46:32,585
What kinds of feelings do you have for her?

384
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:37,010
Make it clear.

385
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:38,865
What is she to you?

386
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,085
I'll look over the contract before canceling.

387
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,755
The feelings I have for her...

388
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,065
may be...

389
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,475
Hae Ra told me.

390
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:32,005
- I'm sorry that... - I know why you did it.

391
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:36,945
- I'm... - I'm sorry.

392
00:48:41,936 --> 00:48:43,355
I'm sorry.

393
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:48,325
Had I not given you my wife's face,

394
00:48:49,543 --> 00:48:52,295
you would've been able to live in peace.

395
00:48:53,314 --> 00:48:56,265
Imagining how painful it must've been for you...

396
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,905
hurts me.

397
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:04,005
I'll make sure you never have to see him again.

398
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,015
Are you doing all right?

399
00:49:11,332 --> 00:49:12,685
I'm worried about you.

400
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,285
Yes, I'm doing all right.

401
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,725
I should...

402
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,695
go.

403
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:37,745
Goodnight.

404
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,445
Don't worry about anything.

405
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,645
Woo Ha Kyung.

406
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,285
Who are you?

407
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:21,715
Who in the world...

408
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,455
are you?

409
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:36,805
That's ridiculous.

410
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:39,775
That can't be.

411
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,545
The feelings I have for her...

412
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:50,285
may be...

413
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:00,855
Perhaps, I can't let go of Ha Kyung.

414
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,595
- Doctor... - Ha Kyung.

415
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:22,975
Or...

416
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,045
If that's not it,

417
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,855
then perhaps,

418
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,955
I want to start...

419
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:35,355
all over again.

420
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:50,220
I've Been Bewitched by Love.

421
00:51:50,224 --> 00:51:52,575
(I've Been Bewitched by Love.)
