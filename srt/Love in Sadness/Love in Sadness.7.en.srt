1
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,530
I painted this.

2
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,885
Is this really yours?

3
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:19,855
Yes, I painted it.

4
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:21,725
Who...

5
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,725
painted this?

6
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:25,770
I don't get involved with the gallery's business.

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,665
According to Ms. Joo, you are...

8
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,865
the owner of this gallery.

9
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,365
I just said that he was her husband.

10
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,450
You can talk to me regarding the gallery.

11
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,405
Since the two of you seemed very close last time,

12
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:45,645
I thought you took care of everything together.

13
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:50,215
I guess all couples have some sort of secrets.

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,765
Are you here regarding the paintings?

15
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:08,705
We can sell your painting, but we need your number.

16
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,980
If you don't want to get involved,

17
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,875
you should at least have a representative.

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,465
(Episode 13: I Was Lucky to Have Met You)

19
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,005
Love...

20
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,145
seeps into our lives and bears its mark.

21
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,845
My love that left a scar...

22
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,645
was consoled by flowers.

23
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:02,055
Its petals that were thinner than a butterfly's wings...

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,355
acted like gauze and covered my pain.

25
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:19,275
Let me buy...

26
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,905
this painting.

27
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,715
Tell me how much it is. It doesn't matter to me.

28
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,385
That's unfortunate.

29
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,790
This could've been our first transaction.

30
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,285
Is there a problem?

31
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,730
We can't get in touch with the artist.

32
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,685
The artist submitted this and disappeared.

33
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,895
Who is this artist?

34
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,180
That'll be all. On your way out, please check your surgery date.

35
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,135
I will. Doctor.

36
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,410
Thank you so much.

37
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,535
- No problem. Goodbye. - Goodbye.

38
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,945
President Kang has a keen eye for paintings.

39
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,670
Who is this?

40
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,155
It's me. Yoon Ma Ri.

41
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,770
Ma Ri?

42
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,640
You were alive?

43
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:24,710
Is it truly you?

44
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,635
I thought you were dead.

45
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,150
By the way,

46
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:32,420
what's going on? Why couldn't I reach you?

47
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:35,005
Woo Seon, listen to me carefully.

48
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,190
Don't tell anyone, and don't get caught.

49
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,215
The Japanese wisteria in front of the auditorium...

50
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:42,415
Can you go there?

51
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,085
The number you have called is busy.

52
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:51,455
The number you have called is busy.

53
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,210
Go faster.

54
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,565
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,115
The artist goes by the name of Leah.

56
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,760
We called the number she left,

57
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:19,385
but they had only submitted it for her and couldn't reach her.

58
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,355
Turn the car around.

59
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,145
Taxi! Taxi!

60
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,825
Tail that car.

61
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:05,295
He wanted to buy that painting with the Cistus?

62
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,895
Yes.

63
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,380
He didn't care how much it was.

64
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:10,905
He wanted it.

65
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,690
How can you sell it if we don't even know who the artist is?

66
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,675
That's why I told him that we couldn't reach the artist.

67
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,015
No matter what painting it is,

68
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,330
don't ever sell it to him.

69
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,200
What's the big deal? It's only a painting.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,460
No.

71
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,725
Don't give him a reason...

72
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:29,255
to come back here.

73
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,995
This is the contract for Ms. Yoon's housing.

74
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,620
It's under my friend's name,

75
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,950
so President Kang won't be able to find out.

76
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,475
Thanks.

77
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,275
Hae Ra.

78
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:53,545
Can you visit her?

79
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,515
Tell her you offered to help.

80
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,825
Are you okay?

81
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:05,895
To be frank,

82
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,195
I can't look her in the eye.

83
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,965
She reminds me of Ha Kyung.

84
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,745
Thank you!

85
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:44,500
Ma Ri, where are you? Why aren't you coming?

86
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,955
Just listen.

87
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:48,070
My husband is following you.

88
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,625
Your husband?

89
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:58,375
Don't overreact. Act naturally.

90
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,205
Okay.

91
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,990
Don't turn your head,

92
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,745
and go straight to the administrative office.

93
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,515
Okay.

94
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,440
Are you still not done?

95
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:27,750
How long do you need to print out a certificate of graduation?

96
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,110
- I'm doing it right now. - I know.

97
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,350
Pretend that you came here not to meet me, but to get...

98
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,375
your certificate of graduation.

99
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,755
Excuse me.

100
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:49,525
What did that lady who just left come here for?

101
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,495
She asked for her certificate of graduation.

102
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,195
Can you tell me...

103
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:57,225
whose graduation certificate it was?

104
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:30,125
If you delay your schedule even longer, it'll become an issue.

105
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,365
Let's go.

106
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,085
Where did she go?

107
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,415
Oh, my gosh.

108
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:53,885
Wait.

109
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,085
Who are you?

110
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,155
I'm Ma Ri, Ma Ri,

111
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,195
Yoon Ma Ri.

112
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:04,795
How... How do you know that?

113
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,665
No way! Wait...

114
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,275
Oh, my gosh.

115
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:16,805
I can't believe this.

116
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:20,515
Ma Ri? Is it truly you?

117
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,045
No matter...

118
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,715
how much I look at you,

119
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,255
I can't believe this.

120
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:29,585
Pinch my cheek, will you?

121
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,955
Gosh, that hurts.

122
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,865
You're right. It's you.

123
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,810
You've been interrogating me for the past hour.

124
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,965
Do you still have more questions?

125
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,075
Well... You see...

126
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,545
I had no idea and was jealous.

127
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,660
I thought you became stuck-up...

128
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:58,315
after marrying into a conglomerate's family and changed.

129
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:02,325
I don't want you to be troubled because of me.

130
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:07,025
So I pondered over this for quite some time.

131
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,140
- Woo Seon. - Yes?

132
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,435
I'm really sorry, but I need to ask you for a favour.

133
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:21,145
Of course, I can become your representative.

134
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,575
But...

135
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,715
what in the world happened to my beloved idol, Yoon Ma Ri,

136
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:31,315
who graduated at the top of her class in art school...

137
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,655
and won the grand prize at the youth arts competition?

138
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:45,995
Oh, the newbie contest at Kyung Art Gallery?

139
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:50,150
I did it for Ma Ri because she asked me to.

140
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,635
Could you...

141
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,075
retrieve that painting?

142
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:57,675
Did Ma Ri return from her trip?

143
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:01,590
That's Ma Ri's painting.

144
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,630
I don't think I have any right to do that.

145
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,115
I'm sure...

146
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,585
she would like you to retrieve it as well.

147
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,855
Oh, right.

148
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,970
Then let me contact her first...

149
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,165
- and I'll... - I'll call you back.

150
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,180
Hey, Kang In Wook.

151
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:24,805
So what if that painting is hers?

152
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,390
You will never be able to find her. Do you know why?

153
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,145
That's because I will always protect her from you.

154
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:40,055
Ma Ri's painting is at Kyung Art Gallery?

155
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,955
Either Joo Hae Ra doesn't know that it's Ma Ri's,

156
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,725
or she's lying to me.

157
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,865
Then...

158
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:52,795
I need to meet...

159
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,265
Director Woo Ha Kyung.

160
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:10,715
Where is the artist?

161
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:19,100
Ma'am, the president of Gunha Construction called.

162
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,340
"Gunha Construction"?

163
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:24,265
Yes. He'd like you to come. He'd like to make a deal.

164
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,065
What?

165
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,705
Suture.

166
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:40,160
Doctor, will... Will... Will I be okay?

167
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:42,190
I can only make a living through these hands.

168
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,645
Don't you worry.

169
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,955
You'll be able to work again soon.

170
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:50,255
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

171
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,625
- You shouldn't move. - Okay.

172
00:14:56,913 --> 00:15:00,095
"You'll be able to work again soon."

173
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:03,435
Gosh, he is amazing.

174
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,635
This emergency surgery wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for me.

175
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:09,950
The reason why he could shine in there...

176
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,860
was because I, the anaesthetist,

177
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:17,160
did a great job anaesthetising him.

178
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,515
Sure, sure.

179
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,285
Good work.

180
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:21,755
- Thank you. - Thank you.

181
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:26,540
Also, I have a favour to ask.

182
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,840
Do tell us.

183
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,265
What is it?

184
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,265
Can we have a minute?

185
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:42,575
It's about that patient we had operated on at night.

186
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,715
- Oh, the VVIP? - The anonymous patient?

187
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:51,655
No one should know about her operation.

188
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:56,400
If someone asks you, please pretend not to know.

189
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:58,655
Why? Is there a...

190
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,165
Don't worry. We won't tell a soul.

191
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:05,895
Sorry, what?

192
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:08,450
Did we ever have such an operation?

193
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:10,505
That's news for me.

194
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:15,145
You should have lunch.

195
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,775
Will you eat alone again?

196
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,145
I'm free, you know?

197
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,060
You can eat with me.

198
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,755
- Why would I? - Oh, come on.

199
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:08,925
(Caregiver)

200
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:14,365
Hello?

201
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:18,450
I really didn't want to call you,

202
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,005
but can you reach Jung Sun Mi's daughter?

203
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,645
Is there a problem?

204
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,745
She refuses to leave the windowsill and cries all day.

205
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:31,145
Thank you for the ride.

206
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,805
Mom, what's wrong?

207
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:22,865
Oh, my. What's wrong?

208
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,495
I'm... I'm sorry.

209
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,735
Where is her daughter?

210
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,165
Well...

211
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,450
She couldn't come, so I came on her behalf.

212
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:34,490
What should we do?

213
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,490
She keeps looking for her daughter and won't budge.

214
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:39,515
Come in.

215
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,365
Mom, your daughter's here.

216
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,035
Are you upset?

217
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,775
I'm sorry.

218
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:13,375
I'm really sorry.

219
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,070
Come on.

220
00:20:29,078 --> 00:20:30,625
No.

221
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,310
What's wrong?

222
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,965
I'm Ma Ri, your daughter.

223
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:37,935
Come on.

224
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,120
No.

225
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,945
- No. - Mom.

226
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:59,300
- Mom, please. - No.

227
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:03,170
- I said I don't want to. - Mom, please.

228
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,335
- Mom. - No.

229
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:07,895
I said no.

230
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,275
Hello, ma'am.

231
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,975
Can I please give you a hand?

232
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,875
Come on.

233
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,445
Come on.

234
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,440
Why are you so light?

235
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,195
You're light as a feather.

236
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,465
You should eat more.

237
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,520
If you don't have much appetite,

238
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:49,345
you shouldn't skip a meal and remember to eat well.

239
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:55,515
Mom.

240
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,345
He is...

241
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,425
the doctor who saved my life.

242
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:05,895
The doctor who saved your life.

243
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:43,925
Are we good now?

244
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,575
Just don't disappear.

245
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,215
It's okay if you are far away from me.

246
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,615
Don't move and stay where you are until I find you.

247
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:52,080
Don't go. Don't go.

248
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,495
Please stay here with me.

249
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,780
Mom! Mom, stop it.

250
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:59,235
The doctor has to go now.

251
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,475
Please don't go!

252
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:05,360
Stay here with me!

253
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,045
Stay here with me.

254
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,385
Ma'am.

255
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,400
Yes?

256
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:18,925
I promise we'll come back again in a short time.

257
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:20,555
Really?

258
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,925
Are you really going to come back?

259
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,480
Yes, I promise.

260
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,895
We'll come back soon.

261
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,105
Thank you.

262
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,775
You have a great daughter.

263
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,275
She's very brave and strong.

264
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:42,585
My daughter...

265
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,500
is so beautiful.

266
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,800
She's brave and strong.

267
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,000
Yes.

268
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,555
You must be so happy to have such an amazing daughter.

269
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,440
We'll be back.

270
00:24:57,446 --> 00:24:59,165
Stay well, okay?

271
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:02,835
You have to come back.

272
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,305
Of course.

273
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,205
I'll be waiting outside.

274
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,215
You're brave and strong.

275
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,215
You're brave and strong.

276
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:57,155
You're brave and strong.

277
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:01,055
I'll make sure I'll be brave and strong.

278
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:06,235
That's the only way...

279
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,805
to repay the doctor.

280
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,935
It's quite upsetting.

281
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,475
Even though I want to do...

282
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,175
a lot of things for him,

283
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,745
I can't.

284
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,200
You want to do a lot of things...

285
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,915
for the doctor?

286
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,285
What?

287
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:36,995
Yes.

288
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,695
There will be something you can do for him.

289
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,805
I'm tired.

290
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,415
Okay, Mom. Get some sleep.

291
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,855
You can go back home now.

292
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,485
Okay.

293
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:29,930
The president of Gunha Construction called.

294
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,460
He'd like you to come. He'd like to make a deal.

295
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,430
If you get a call from President Kang,

296
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:36,085
make sure you tell me first.

297
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,170
Why are you pretending to be like a Rodin sculpture...

298
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:42,395
when there's a person sitting beside you?

299
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,665
Is it because of Doctor Seo?

300
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:51,705
I told you to tell him about your feelings.

301
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,550
Love can't be delivered unless you tell him.

302
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:56,545
That's the only way.

303
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:58,360
He can't read your mind.

304
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,245
Also, Doctor Seo doesn't know much about love.

305
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,745
You're not competing with someone anymore.

306
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,385
You have a higher chance.

307
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:09,730
What are you talking about? I have a stronger rival now.

308
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:11,455
What does that mean?

309
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,925
How can there be a stronger rival than Woo Ha Kyung?

310
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,795
Woo Ha Kyung was the only woman in Doctor Seo's life.

311
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,340
She has the face of Woo Ha Kyung,

312
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:24,005
but instead of being mean and pretty, this woman is like...

313
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,205
a Cinderella in sneakers.

314
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,205
There's a woman like that?

315
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:31,275
Who is it?

316
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,745
Why do you ask?

317
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,045
Because I want to date her.

318
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:43,625
People certainly don't change.

319
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,825
I'm going to go.

320
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,625
I was just kidding.

321
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,995
There's something going on...

322
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,365
with Doctor Seo these days, right?

323
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:56,835
He asked me to do some research about President Kang.

324
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,045
- You don't need to know. - I deserve more than that.

325
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:05,360
When you lost against Ha Kyung...

326
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,045
and Jung Won didn't see you as a woman, I was always here beside you.

327
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,385
What's going on with him?

328
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:14,530
I need to know before I help you.

329
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:17,625
If you want to help, pay the bill.

330
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:23,925
Hae Ra.

331
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,835
This is driving me crazy.

332
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,475
I'm going crazy all because of you, Seo Jung Won.

333
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,945
Whatever. I'm going to do what I want to do.

334
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,115
I don't care...

335
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,315
if that woman will be in danger.

336
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:56,410
(Episode 14)

337
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:59,665
When I was 10, my father passed away.

338
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:04,235
My mother couldn't stop yearning for him.

339
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:09,045
She relied on alcohol every single day.

340
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,575
One day,

341
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:14,645
she collapsed and injured her head.

342
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,655
After that, she had trouble remembering.

343
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,655
When was she diagnosed with dementia?

344
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:25,655
When I was in 10th grade.

345
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:29,465
Her condition worsened,

346
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:32,535
and we moved more than 20 times.

347
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:35,365
I became exhausted.

348
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:39,905
I wanted to run away.

349
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,505
So I perceived getting married...

350
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,715
as a way...

351
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:48,175
to run away from her.

352
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,385
I was the biggest coward in the world.

353
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,085
And now,

354
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,355
I'm receiving my due punishment.

355
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,835
Thank you so much for today.

356
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:13,305
She was delighted to have a guest.

357
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:15,905
She'd been alone all along.

358
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,760
Both my mom and I have so much to thank you for.

359
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:25,455
From now on, let me accompany you whenever you visit her.

360
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:29,125
We promised her, you know?

361
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,665
And as I've mentioned in the car,

362
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,495
you should move.

363
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:41,435
Thank you so much.

364
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:46,805
But I'm going to remain here.

365
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,620
From that rooftop over there,

366
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:51,820
I can see my mom's sanitarium.

367
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,190
I like this place...

368
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:57,245
because I can greet her no matter how far I am.

369
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,700
I'm totally fine.

370
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:02,055
And I've found a job.

371
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:06,100
I'll be making money soon, and I'll bring my mom home.

372
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:08,295
You really needn't worry.

373
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,535
Hello, ma'am. This way.

374
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,575
Come in.

375
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:29,245
You wished to see me?

376
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:37,585
When did I say that I wanted to see you?

377
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:43,985
I asked for Director Woo, not you.

378
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:46,595
Do you not understand Korean?

379
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,595
Director Woo...

380
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:51,980
is busy preparing for her exhibition.

381
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,435
I'm taking care of all external work.

382
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,335
Exhibition?

383
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:06,075
From what I've heard, she's not that great at painting.

384
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,155
Sit down.

385
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,095
I'll cut to the chase.

386
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:31,905
I'd like to hold hands and do business with Kyung Art Gallery.

387
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:38,290
First, I'd like to buy a piece to display in the lobby.

388
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,745
I'd like Director Woo to recommend me one.

389
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,215
As for the price,

390
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,985
it's your call.

391
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:54,925
Thank you, sir.

392
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:58,625
We'll select some pieces and send them over.

393
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,265
This means that we've joined hands.

394
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:12,815
But there's one condition.

395
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:17,185
From now on, I'd like...

396
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:19,715
to talk directly with Director Woo regarding our business.

397
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:24,855
I'm afraid that will be difficult.

398
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,000
As I have mentioned,

399
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,140
I'll be taking care of all external...

400
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:31,540
If this is all you can offer,

401
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,865
I may have to stop our transaction.

402
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:39,175
What do you mean?

403
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:46,960
What is this?

404
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:51,015
(Statement of Bidding)

405
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:02,225
Wait.

406
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:07,235
Do you mean the chairman who has been buying...

407
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:09,550
our paintings is the chairman of Gunha Group?

408
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:11,535
I've looked into it,

409
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,675
and there has been quite an extensive amount of transactions.

410
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:23,545
It seems like the majority of your sales is from us.

411
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,855
Will you be fine with my cancelling this deal?

412
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:42,195
What?

413
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,250
Ms. Yoon will need to pretend to be Ha Kyung.

414
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,945
What do you mean?

415
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:51,120
It can't be helped.

416
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,360
The broker who took care of more than 70 percent of our sales...

417
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:56,285
is from Gunha Group.

418
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:00,560
I clearly remember telling you not to meet him alone...

419
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,230
This is regarding the gallery.

420
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:05,025
The fate of this gallery is in his hands.

421
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:07,795
We're done talking.

422
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,125
My answer will always be the same, so don't bring this up again.

423
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:15,765
Please persuade her.

424
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,780
Do you think this makes sense?

425
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:20,435
We really have...

426
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:23,275
no choice at all anymore.

427
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,515
First, it was you. Now, it's me.

428
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:29,685
Kang In Wook has us in his trap.

429
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,785
We know that it's a trap,

430
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,085
but if we want to end this, we have to enter his trap.

431
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,755
If he ever comes again, call me.

432
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,665
I'll deal with him.

433
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:44,800
This is Oh Cheol Young.

434
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:46,370
You're fired.

435
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,525
I have some information on Woo Ha Kyung.

436
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:55,365
Five years ago, she was badly injured in a car accident.

437
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,680
She has remained unconscious...

438
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,935
and have received treatment ever since.

439
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,155
The surgery was a success.

440
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,400
But if you want to regain strength in your thumb,

441
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:22,470
you need to undergo rehabilitation.

442
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:24,810
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

443
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:27,080
This way. Let me give you the prescription.

444
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,235
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

445
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:40,315
(Mother)

446
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,860
- Yes? - Jung Won.

447
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:47,100
I'm currently in Busan because of a seminar.

448
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:50,925
I heard that a cop visited my house.

449
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,640
A cop came to your house?

450
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,040
Yes.

451
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,495
The nursing director told me that she was asking about Ha Kyung.

452
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,635
Is something going on?

453
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:01,795
Please tell her...

454
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:03,780
not to say anything.

455
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:05,680
I told her...

456
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:08,380
to tell the cop to contact you.

457
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:10,345
What's going on?

458
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:13,220
I'll tell you later.

459
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:15,075
I need to hang up.

460
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:27,670
Yes?

461
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,265
Is this Doctor Seo Jung Won?

462
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,340
Who is this?

463
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,040
My name is Oh Cheol Young.

464
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:36,205
I visited you once regarding a dress.

465
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,150
What is it?

466
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:41,350
The director wasn't home.

467
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,105
I couldn't reach her either.

468
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,820
How dare you go there?

469
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:47,320
I heard that...

470
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:50,645
Ms. Woo received treatment here for the past five years.

471
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,415
But the lady here says that she doesn't know.

472
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:59,025
This is none of your business.

473
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:08,565
(Nursing Director)

474
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:17,045
Hello, Dr. Seo.

475
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,315
Is that cop with you right now?

476
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,785
Yes.

477
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:26,160
Listen to me carefully.

478
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,930
Don't answer...

479
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:29,570
any of her questions.

480
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,485
I'm on my way, so just tell her that you know nothing.

481
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,070
The caregiver is here, and so are the employees.

482
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,255
But none of them will open up.

483
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:13,625
Something's fishy.

484
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:45,125
You came all the way here.

485
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,895
What are you so curious about?

486
00:44:19,006 --> 00:44:21,270
The caregiver is here, and so are the employees.

487
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,225
But none of them will open up.

488
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,015
Why are you here?

489
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:51,525
Then...

490
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,370
what about you?

491
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:56,070
Dr. Seo's mother has been here for the past five years...

492
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:57,625
Go outside.

493
00:44:58,713 --> 00:45:00,165
Yes, sir.

494
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,525
Are we done now?

495
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:29,470
My wife stayed here for the past five years...

496
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,425
but was discharged after recovering.

497
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,695
I finally have her back in my arms.

498
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:39,575
I've shared with you my painful past.

499
00:45:40,054 --> 00:45:42,805
So I hope that you will stop looking around for her.

500
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,685
You should leave.

501
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,425
What should we do?

502
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:50,305
You know what?

503
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:59,085
My heart beats crazily when I'm being deceived.

504
00:47:01,769 --> 00:47:03,485
And that's how I feel right now.

505
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:21,320
Thoroughly dig into Woo Ha Kyung's accident...

506
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:24,605
and what she has been up to for the past five years.

507
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,675
Yes, sir.

508
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:00,615
Thank you so much.

509
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,830
If someone else comes here again...

510
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,260
and asks about her, you mustn't tell them of her passing.

511
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,830
Don't worry, and be on your way.

512
00:48:07,835 --> 00:48:09,400
You have surgery scheduled.

513
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:11,825
I cannot explain this in detail at the moment,

514
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,255
but it's regarding one's life.

515
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:16,195
Please trust me and help.

516
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,125
Somebody...

517
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,665
did pick up Ma Ri there.

518
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,295
I was right.

519
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,905
Even if the road is foggy full of anxiety,

520
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:16,785
even if the road is heading towards sadness,

521
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,955
I won't stumble anymore.

522
00:50:23,704 --> 00:50:25,125
I won't...

523
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:26,925
cry anymore.

524
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:32,110
I Was Lucky to Have Met You.

525
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,995
(I Was Lucky to Have Met You.)
