20

You must be a close friend of her.

only with someone they can trust.

24

It's not like we work in partnership.

Is that what you're saying?

33
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,325
Why did you pretend not to know me when you actually do?

I know all the celebrities in this country.

Do you know anything about him?

46

Sure. He's very popular among women I know.

50

And he's such a romanticist.

That's what I'm branded as.

86
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,745

That's how...

90

I grew away from my friends and acquaintances...

91
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,825

00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,950
You should worry about your own problems.

173
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,790
I just can't leave her alone.

174
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,275
She ran onto the road prepared for death.

175
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:23,645
Isn't it that...

176
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:27,315
your mind is reeling at the face?

177
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:31,255
Are you sure you aren't falling...

178
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,725
for the face you operated on.

179
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,265
Find a place...

180
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,465
where she can stay safe alone.

181
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:46,035
You have to let Ha Kyung go.

182
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:51,645
Do you even know what Ha Kyung was like?

183
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,515
I really...

184
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,985
I wasn't going to tell you this.

185
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,555
But you should know this.

186
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,155
I'm telling you this so you can get over Ha Kyung.

187
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,995
Ha Kyung...

188
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:17,905
Ha Kyung had...

189
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,715
Did you...

190
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,025
Did you know...

191
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,425
about that?

192
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,275
When did you find out?

193
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,975
Did you...

194
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:03,215
know that even before the accident?

195
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,985
Did you?

196
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:28,420
How could you be like that?

197
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:31,420
How could you love her knowing all that for five years?

198
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:33,120
You only cared about Ha Kyung...

199
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,815
for five years knowing all that!

200
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:53,465
So you knew all that?

201
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,135
And you lived under a rock...

202
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,605
only for Ha Kyung?

203
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:07,475
You are unbelievable.

204
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,085
That darn love.

205
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:50,255
That day,

206
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:54,325
I wanted to have it off my chest...

207
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,425
and...

208
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:02,235
put our love back on track.

209
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,905
That day,

210
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:10,375
I should never have let her go.

211
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:20,830
A month from now, on Sunday,

212
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:23,955
at this very hotel, we are getting married.

213
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,455
That day,

214
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,795
I shouldn't have...

215
00:20:29,078 --> 00:20:31,565
accepted his proposal.

216
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:39,905
Knowing that she was going to see someone else,

217
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,075
I just watched her leave...

218
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,045
afraid to lose her.

219
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:48,615
I shouldn't have done that.

220
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,315
I shouldn't have...

221
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,455
gotten married just to escape...

222
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:59,755
from the harsh realities.

223
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:29,560
Dad, are you looking down at me from there?

224
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,660
Please let me find a gallery...

225
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,485
who buys my paintings.

226
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:47,665
I'm sorry, but we don't buy paintings of rookie artists.

227
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:07,185
Young artists need to have a sponsor.

228
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:30,120
Why do you sell other artists' paintings...

229
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,290
without painting your own?

230
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,675
You didn't know that?

231
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:37,515
I have no talent for art.

232
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,385
Woo Seon.

233
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:49,670
Am I seeing things now?

234
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,965
This is strange.

235
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:55,780
Then sell some paintings and buy me dinner.

236
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:59,635
Are you kidding me now?

237
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,695
I was looking for you.

238
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:29,335
Don't you have anything to say to me?

239
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:45,015
(Meat Buffet)

240
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:50,155
(Wanted: Kitchen staff)

241
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,795
Look at my face and talk to me.

242
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,565
How can you smile?

243
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,865
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

244
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:05,180
Why bother?

245
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:07,180
Do you have a heart of stone or what?

246
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:10,575
Why are you being so stupid?

247
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:13,590
How could you be like that knowing all that about Ha Kyung?

248
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,160
You devoted yourself to taking care of her...

249
00:25:16,164 --> 00:25:18,415
without caring about anyone else.

250
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,915
I just can't...

251
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,385
understand you.

252
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,525
Tell me what you were feeling.

253
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,010
How could they quit without notice like that?

254
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:35,465
We are already short of hands because of the event.

255
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,865
Are you sure you can do this?

256
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:39,950
Yes, I can do this.

257
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,350
Let's get started then.

258
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:44,175
Tell her what to do.

259
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:54,885
Do you think Ha Kyung really deserves your love?

260
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:57,285
All right.

261
00:25:57,406 --> 00:26:00,855
It's your choice whether she deserves it or not.

262
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:04,625
But you've been like a fool...

263
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:07,565
for the past five years.

264
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:10,635
When you find a new place for Ma Ri,

265
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,850
you should think of safety.

266
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,905
I want to find it myself,

267
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,245
but Ma Ri wouldn't let me help her.

268
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:20,790
Since you're a woman...

269
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,915
Is she the only one you care about?

270
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,530
Let me ask you one more thing.

271
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:27,585
What does Yoon Ma Ri mean to you?

272
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,425
Someone I want to protect.

273
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:38,095
What?

274
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:41,065
I want to help her.

275
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:43,335
So she can overcome her fear.

276
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,905
Fine.

277
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:51,520
That's who you are.

278
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,390
You try to protect...

279
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:56,960
a stray dog, a stray cat, or even a beetle that flies into your house.

280
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,730
Is Yoon Ma Ri a beetle?

281
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,830
Do you want to protect her because she's a stray cat?

282
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,800
That's because she looks like Ha Kyung.

283
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:07,025
Only because she looks like that wench, Woo Ha Kyung.

284
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,025
I don't...

285
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:15,065
want to regret anymore.

286
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,435
But...

287
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,175
why does it...

288
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,075
have to be Yoon Ma Ri?

289
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:28,275
I just go out to her.

290
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,415
- What? - She wants to live now.

291
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:37,655
I want to protect her this time.

292
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,495
What are you guys doing here?

293
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:54,635
Hey, Hae Ra.

294
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,230
All right. Hurry.

295
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:09,285
Be careful. They're hot.

296
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,970
My goodness.

297
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,325
Did you burn yourself?

298
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,665
- I'm okay. - Be careful.

299
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:24,235
Those without agony can't get in here.

300
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:25,935
And what are you doing here?

301
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:27,935
What about you?

302
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:31,005
I agonize all the time.

303
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,590
Am I doing things right?

304
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,745
I worry about myself all the time.

305
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:37,660
Hard-nosed actresses...

306
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,215
and bothersome aspiring actresses.

307
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:43,955
I feel empty even when I hang out with them.

308
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:46,925
You seemed happy though.

309
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:51,695
What do you know about me?

310
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:54,595
By the way,

311
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,065
what's going on between Hae Ra and you?

312
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,935
I've never seen you guys have a fight.

313
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:06,345
I saw President Kang In Wook at the gallery.

314
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,845
Is this about it?

315
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:12,685
How much do you know about Kang In Wook?

316
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:16,230
I do know that he's a mysterious man.

317
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,755
- Why? - Can you...

318
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,955
look into him a little?

319
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,495
I didn't know you'd ask me a favour.

320
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:29,035
Tell me what this is about first.

321
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,150
Apparently, you wouldn't...

322
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,775
tell me the details.

323
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,690
Okay.

324
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,845
We have an unconditional friendship. I'll do it with no strings attached.

325
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,115
I'll look into it pulling out all the connections I have.

326
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,405
(Exhibition Sponsorship Contract, Gunha Group)

327
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:12,445
Let me ask you one more thing. What does Yoon Ma Ri mean to you?

328
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,045
Someone I want to protect.

329
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,885
Why does it have to be...

330
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,855
Yoon Ma Ri of all people?

331
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,620
Moving onto the next report.

332
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:42,390
The Korean business industry is buzzing.

333
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,520
Gunha Group, which marked the highest rate...

334
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,420
of business development for the last four years,

335
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,945
is making their first move this year.

336
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:51,190
Before the general shareholders' meeting for the first half,

337
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,630
they've held the directors' meeting...

338
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,030
to discuss organizing their management system...

339
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:56,700
and listing their affiliates on the stock market.

340
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:59,100
- The cobra of all cobras. - It's expected...

341
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,140
there will be a lot of changes.

342
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:02,740
- The king cobra. - There are speculations...

343
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,880
this might mark the beginning...

344
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,965
of their succession issue.

345
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,010
The other businesses seem...

346
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:12,575
to take corresponding actions followed by their move.

347
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,375
("President Kang In Wook and His Heirship")

348
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:53,290
(Episode 12)

349
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:54,815
You're still at work.

350
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:58,230
I was worried whether I should tell you this on the phone.

351
00:31:58,233 --> 00:31:59,615
I'm glad you're here.

352
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,315
Did you look into it already?

353
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,225
Of course, it's your request.

354
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,055
I'm coming back from talking with the reporter I know until this hour.

355
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:02,885
What is it?

356
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,315
What?

357
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:08,385
Where?

358
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:11,055
Send me the location.

359
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:22,650
What? She killed herself?

360
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,310
Exactly.

361
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,775
There were rumours everywhere in the stock market.

362
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,090
That the wife of Gunha Group's owner killed herself...

363
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,545
with a gun.

364
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:34,615
Here's what's even more shocking.

365
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:37,145
No one knew why.

366
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:40,560
People speculated she had depression or she was abused,

367
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:42,385
but that was all.

368
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,825
Oh, right.

369
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,425
This.

370
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,695
It was so hard to get my hands on this, by the way.

371
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,010
The company...

372
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:53,895
got rid of every single picture of the Gunha Group family.

373
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:57,765
I put my life on the line to get this for you.

374
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:00,405
It's not the original though.

375
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:03,450
Hi.

376
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,345
Everyone's there?

377
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,160
Where, Cheongdam-dong?

378
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:08,160
I know where that is.

379
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:10,685
- I'll be off. Bye. - Okay, thanks.

380
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:12,685
Okay.

381
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:15,995
Look at yourself.

382
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:19,295
The woman your husband is looking for...

383
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,095
no longer exists.

384
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:22,805
Don't be afraid.

385
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,175
Look at yourself.

386
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,645
He can't recognize you.

387
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:32,345
It's fine.

388
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:35,145
He can't find me.

389
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:48,795
- Is this the place? - Yes, this is the house.

390
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,045
She looks very similar to the woman in the picture.

391
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,545
It was so hard to find her because she was hiding in a place like this.

392
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,935
She ran away like crazy.

393
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,790
I'm telling you.

394
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,120
You don't believe me?

395
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:46,720
What's wrong with that?

396
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,815
It's fun, punk.

397
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,560
Yes.

398
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,785
I'm telling you the truth.

399
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:56,455
Isn't she the one you're looking for?

400
00:40:57,638 --> 00:40:59,425
Are you kidding me?

401
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:01,340
How dare you waste my time?

402
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,870
Her profile corresponded with the information you provided.

403
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,110
- She looked similar too. - "Similar".

404
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:09,205
You made me come all the way over here because she was similar.

405
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:12,235
You're fired.

406
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:14,305
Find someone else for the job.

407
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,475
Give me a little more time, sir.

408
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,170
That's amazing, sweetheart.

409
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:51,710
Did you really draw that?

410
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,935
Yes, I did.

411
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:00,680
You should use your hands just for drawing...

412
00:44:00,688 --> 00:44:02,375
and not for anything else.

413
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,290
Maybe I should take out insurance on your hands.

414
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:08,045
A very expensive one.

415
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:11,890
10 million dollars...

416
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,015
No, even 100 million dollars aren't worth your hands.

417
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:15,815
That's how precious your hands are.

418
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:20,395
Ma Ri.

419
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:24,525
You risked your life to escape for a reason.

420
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:29,065
To be yourself.

421
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:31,735
To have your own dream.

422
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,105
Right.

423
00:44:34,288 --> 00:44:36,890
As long as I can draw with my hands,

424
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:38,545
I'll do anything.

425
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,745
I'll draw to feed myself.

426
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:43,790
I'll draw...

427
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:45,815
to support my mom.

428
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:53,595
The shareholders' meeting...

429
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:55,555
has been scheduled.

430
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:58,565
Don't complain,

431
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,210
and just follow my words this time.

432
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:03,305
Like I told you,

433
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,410
I know better about the agenda of this meeting...

434
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:06,975
How foolish.

435
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,975
This is why you still have a long way to go.

436
00:45:11,392 --> 00:45:13,675
Eat your food while it's warm, Mr. Chairman.

437
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,815
I'm the same age...

438
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:21,960
of when you founded the company at a small warehouse.

439
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,400
You're still too soft.

440
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:25,525
I got beaten up since I was little.

441
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,555
It made me tough.

442
00:45:30,111 --> 00:45:33,935
Being tough isn't what you need to run a company.

443
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:37,965
The chairman's doctor came to check his condition yesterday.

444
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:40,035
He has high blood pressure these days.

445
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:41,420
Maybe he has a lot of worries.

446
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:42,875
Shut it.

447
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:46,315
Keep your mouth shut during mealtimes.

448
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:49,585
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

449
00:45:49,697 --> 00:45:51,115
I don't care...

450
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:55,500
who's younger or older when it comes to the heir issue.

451
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,285
Only the desperate ones...

452
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:02,725
survive and fill their stomach.

453
00:46:21,662 --> 00:46:23,045
In Wook.

454
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:26,485
In Wook.

455
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:34,355
Did Ma Ri...

456
00:46:37,478 --> 00:46:39,095
go somewhere?

457
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,795
Why isn't she around these days?

458
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,405
Why do you ask?

459
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,005
Well...

460
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,735
This is another start.

461
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:26,675
Let's get along today.

462
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:38,685
Turn the car around.

463
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:20,640
How may I help you?

464
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,010
To meet the director.

465
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:24,480
You mean, the vice-director? She said she'd come late today.

466
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,635
I'm here to meet Ms. Woo Ha Kyung.

467
00:48:29,623 --> 00:48:31,845
My wife isn't here.

468
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,275
This is amusing.

469
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,845
You show up whenever I come here to meet Ms. Woo.

470
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:42,955
- Go prepare some tea, please. - Sure.

471
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,225
Mr. Kang.

472
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:52,680
Oh, sorry. I didn't get to introduce myself yet.

473
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,435
You appear on news shows, so there's no need to.

474
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,865
By the way,

475
00:48:57,885 --> 00:48:59,775
who are you looking for?

476
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,120
If you need help, explain your situation and ask for help.

477
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:07,915
I don't think you have any intention to help out.

478
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:10,345
Am I wrong?

479
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,015
If that's what you think,

480
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,085
stop coming here.

481
00:49:15,903 --> 00:49:18,430
I'll find that person myself. My own self.

482
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:20,695
That's more of the reason why you should stop coming here.

483
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,465
I won't tolerate any longer.

484
00:49:34,355 --> 00:49:37,145
I'm afraid I can't join you for tea. I have surgery to do.

485
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:40,515
I hope we don't see each other again.

486
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,045
Wait.

487
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,095
Will you take a look at my painting?

488
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:21,585
Thank you for naming it.

489
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,785
"A Self-Portrait".

490
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,325
"A Self-Portrait".

491
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:39,305
Who...

492
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:41,575
painted this?

493
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,615
I painted this.

494
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:52,015
I wish to protect...

495
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,885
the flower shivering in fear.

496
00:50:56,236 --> 00:50:58,055
The flower...

497
00:50:58,672 --> 00:51:00,595
that wants to bloom.

498
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,910
"If You Stay by My Side"

499
00:51:04,912 --> 00:51:06,695
(If You Stay by My Side)

500
00:51:19,793 --> 00:51:22,290
(Love in Sadness)

501
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:24,090
I told you to give me some time.

502
00:51:24,098 --> 00:51:25,760
And I told you.

503
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,400
I'm bad at waiting.

504
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:29,130
Where is my wife?

505
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:31,230
- Director Woo Ha Kyung... - What is your point?

506
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:34,070
That's the day my wife disappeared.

507
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:35,370
Let me tell you...

508
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,370
how you can hide.
