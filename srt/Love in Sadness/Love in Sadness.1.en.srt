(Episode 1: I Will Die Tomorrow)

2
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,040
I like flowers.

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,735
The small, fragile, and tranquil...

5
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,975
flowers.

6
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:57,260
Mr. Seo, I hear you have extensive knowledge about flowers.

7
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,985
Perhaps that's how you manage to fix one's face like a flower.

8
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:04,215
I wouldn't say I "fix" one's face.

9
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:08,385
You don't consider it as fixing?

10
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:10,855
For me,

11
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:13,565
I just want to provide...

12
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:17,465
an opportunity to restart one's life to those who are in pain.

13
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,805
You want to provide an opportunity to restart one's life?

14
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:25,075
If surgical operations save patients' lives,

15
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,790
plastic surgeries save...

16
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,305
the inner soul of patients.

17
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,860
A surgery that saves the inner soul of patients.

18
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,585
That's amazing.

19
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,115
Thank you.

20
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,355
Why aren't you getting ready?

21
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,055
What kind of flower is it?

22
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,335
It resembles you.

23
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,005
It...

24
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:58,980
resembles me?

25
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,345
Yes.

26
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,075
It does.

27
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,845
It resembles you.

28
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,815
Thank you. You gave me the title of this piece.

29
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,015
I just decided on it.

30
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:14,485
What is it?

31
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,055
"A Self-Portrait"

32
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,295
In that case,

33
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,895
I'll buy it.

34
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,405
I'll buy this piece instead of the company.

35
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,405
It's your self-portrait. I don't want everybody to look at it.

36
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,105
Only I should get to look at it.

37

We're going to be late.

38

Let's go.

42
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,945
Yes. Do as I told you to.

43
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,945
I'll take all the responsibility.

44
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,485
I said that's...

45
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,525
not necessary.

46
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,055
Can you give me a second?

47
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,165
Anyway.

48

My patients don't come to me to simply become beautiful.

They come to me because they want to have their lives back.

56
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:28,985
I sincerely want their lives to bloom like flowers.

57

58

Go home.

63

I have another surgery with Doctor Ha.

76
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,260
By the way, I think Doctor Ha became too money-oriented.

77

I can't count how many surgeries he has scheduled in a day.

I apologize for the wait.

82

When they age, their faces change.

That's only natural.

113

Even if they give birth or age,

114
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,540
women must look young and beautiful.

115

Changing your face...

136
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,535
won't change your life.

What if my face ruined my life?

139
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,060
Many people are like you and come here for plastic surgery.

140
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,770
But they become better after receiving psychotherapy.

141
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:51,825
I'll introduce you to a competent doctor.

142
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,395
You have a prejudice against patients...

143
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,135
who want to change their faces.

144
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,735
You think they just want to look beautiful.

145
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,075
You think they're just twisted and greedy people.

146
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,475
Since I heard that...

147
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,415
you save people by changing their lives,

148
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:19,460
I thought, perhaps, you'd be on my side.

149
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,930
I think there's a misunderstanding.

150
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:23,055
- What I meant was... - You see...

151
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,995
I must change my face...

152
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,235
in order to survive.

153
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,845

155
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,015
No, thanks.

Do you always run away like that?

158
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,035
My patients are used to hiding their scars.

159
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:10,265
But in front of me, they take courage.

160
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,820
They tell me in detail about their scars...

161
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,705
and how much pain they're in.

162
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,605
That's the only way the doctor and the patient become a team.

163
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,815
I only gave you that offer...

164
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,645
because it seemed like your scar was in your heart, not your face.

165
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,285
It seems like you don't want to elaborate on it.

166
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,155
If you decide to run away,

167
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,825
there is no way for me to help you.

168
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,785
Let's stop playing hide and seek.

169
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:04,470
The person you're planning to meet in Shanghai won't be there.

00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,255
I already paid them...

171
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,395
what you've promised.

172
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:14,580
You were quite meticulous this time.

173
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,720
You changed your identity and your occupation.

174
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,945
However, whatever you did wouldn't have gone your way.

175
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:27,845
Just let me go.

176
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,285
Please let me go.

177
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,355
Move aside.

178
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,265
Move!

179
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,535
This is enough.

180
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,605
This is it.

181
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,735
You need to stop here. You must.

182
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,075
Stop now.

183
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,485
Don't just think about running away.

184
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:11,195
Confront it.

185
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,195
That's the only way you can change your life.

186
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,795
You're welcome to come back once you change your mind.

187
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,235
Only then, we can find out...

188
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,975
if we can be a team.

What if my face ruined my life?

191
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,855
I must change my face...

192
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,955
in order to survive.

193
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:30,235
I'm done selling at the gallery for the day. I'm reporting to you.

194
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,550
I'm sorry the gallery is in red ink.

195
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:35,445
I'm apologizing to you.

196
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,490
You can look forward to the rookie artist hunting project.

197
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:43,385
It's going to help our gallery become more renowned.

198
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,185
If we're lucky, we might succeed in finding a major artist.

199
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,370
Can you show more interest in the gallery?

200
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:54,495
You're the owner of Kyung Art Gallery.

201
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,895
You always do well.

202
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,265
Also, the owner of the gallery is Ha Kyung, not me.

203
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,305
Take a look at this when you get home.

204
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,420
From my knowledge, you have the keenest eye...

205
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,850
when it comes to paintings.

206
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,615
All the paintings are in there, so narrow it down for me.

Did you go to the gallery alone?

212
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,345
Are you okay?

213
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:33,975
Give it to me.

Ma Ri.

how beautiful your neck is?

What I love the most...

218
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:09,015
is that only I can touch it.

219
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:18,225
I'm exhausted.

220
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:22,670
I've had my eyes on a quarry for a few months...

221
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,665
and finally got the chance to rip it apart.

222
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,135
I just left the hunting ground that reeked of blood...

223
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:30,935
and came home to you.

224
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:33,505
Ma Ri.

225
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,345
I can't live...

226
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:39,775
without you.

227
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,645
I just can't.

228

Don't just think about running away.

229

How many times are you calling today?

232
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,725
Do you miss your old mom that much?

233

Look at me.

Move!

252
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:04,065
That's enough, Father.

253
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:08,575
There will be...

254
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,705
no next time.

255
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,975

256

Sit down.

Let's eat.

259
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,875
What happened to the Jeju-do project?

260
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,785
Did you get it done?

261
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,015
Mr. Choi will give you a report.

262
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:54,660
What if I'd like to hear it directly...

263
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,485
from the president of Gunha Construction?

264
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:02,395
I did it well just the way you had taught me.

265
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:04,365
By the way,

266
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,335
I'd appreciate it if we didn't talk about work at home.

267
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,165
If you don't,

268
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:11,735
we'll eat separately.

269
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,505
Fine.

270
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:21,890
Then how about we talk about something...

271
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:23,860
more personal?

272
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:27,355
For example, why is Ma Ri still not pregnant?

273
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,585
You've been married for five years.

274
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:33,700
You rejected all the other prospects and even me...

275
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,540
in order to marry her.

276
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,170
If she doesn't give me a grandchild,

277
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:39,695
I will be immensely disappointed!

278
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,750
She's regularly taking the herbal medicine...

279
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,965
that was prescribed to her by Dr. Ko.

280
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:48,220
I'm certain she will bring us good news soon.

281
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:50,050
That's for us to discuss.

282
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:52,015
No, this is a family matter.

283
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,390
This is regarding our family that I,

284
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,745
Kang Il Gook, built from the ground up!

285
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,100
All of you guys are good for nothing,

286
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:04,225
but receive far better treatment than you deserve!

287
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,365
In order for us not to harm this family's reputation,

288
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:13,095
I'll do my best, Father.

289
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,795
I promise.

290
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,635
Don't get in Father's way.

291
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,295
You almost got hurt.

292
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,035
Goodbye.

293
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:54,235
It's the weekend, but I'm still bogged down in work.

294
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:57,005
I'll come home early.

295

Ma Ri.

296
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,625
Smile for me.

297
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:16,995
I don't think...

298
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,695
I've seen you smile for a long time.

299

What are you doing?

00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:14,655
Have you been doing this all along?

303
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:20,695
I don't want a kid.

304
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:21,970
What do you mean?

305
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,325
I know...

306
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,910
you're going to lock me up after I have the kid.

307
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,495
Lock you up?

308
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:30,865
I'm only trying to protect you.

309
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:34,335
What's the problem?

310
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,705
No one in this world loves you...

311
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,375
- as much as I do. - Love?

312
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,575
Did you say, "love"?

313
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:44,015
Is locking me up the meaning of love?

314
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:48,215
I want to breathe.

315
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,955
Please let me breathe!

316
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:10,805
Look.

317
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,775
Isn't this what you wanted?

318
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,375
You wanted...

319
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,790
to paint.

320
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:18,245
I want...

321
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,655
to take my paintings outside myself.

322
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:25,540
I want to sell them to others,

323
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,855
not to your company.

324
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:30,610
I want to be a part of society.

325
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,595
I don't want to live as your woman.

326
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,065
I want to live as me.

327
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,205
I want to live as Yoon Ma Ri.

328
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:41,775
Why can't you accept that?

329
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,990
I know that you'll abuse your power...

330
00:35:45,994 --> 00:35:47,715
and stop me.

331
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,645
You will switch the winners.

332
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:53,660
You're going to treat my paintings as garbage.

333
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,725
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

334
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,640
I couldn't believe it.

335
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,740
I thought about it numerous times.

336
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,225
I wondered why you did that.

337
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:07,635
You know what?

338
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:10,565
You just want...

339
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:13,635
to lock me up in the world...

340
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,505
you've created and watch me.

341
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:19,515
That's your definition of love.

342
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,285
Ma Ri.

343
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:34,395
You can have and do whatever you want.

344
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:36,625
You just need...

345
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:39,035
to be by my side...

346
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,795
and show me...

347
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,405
your smile...

348
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:46,275
and your happiness.

349
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:49,645
I can't be happy that way!

350
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:51,905
Also,

351
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:56,715
I am not your mother.

352
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,230
If I didn't look like her,

353
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:03,685
would you have truly loved me?

354
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,825
Would you have come after me...

355
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:09,395
every time I ran away?

356
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,075
I said that wasn't true.

357
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,145
I told you...

358
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,345
not to say those things.

359
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,875
What do you know...

360
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,790
about my mother?

361
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,145
I know about her.

362
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:37,955
Your mother was pitiful.

363
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,355
And...

364
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:43,195
I will also meet that same fate!

365
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:50,535
I see.

366
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,710
Ha Kyung, I'm here as well.

367
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:27,380
Why are you here again?

368
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:30,310
Hi Mom, I've missed you.

369
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:33,180
Why did you come here when you're busy?

370
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:37,990
Hey, please tell him to stop visiting.

371
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:41,690
Tell him to meet his friends on the weekends.

372
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:44,230
He's so young but only goes to work and then comes here.

373
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:45,500
It's disgusting.

374
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,115
I know, right?

375
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,630
Isn't it difficult to live here alone?

376
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,455
It's time to come to Seoul.

377
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:57,325
I have to stay here until Ha Kyung wakes up.

378
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,850
I'm so jealous.

379
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:08,435
Both you and Jung Won only think about Ha Kyung.

380
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:11,850
I guess Ha Kyung is family, but I'm not.

381
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,345
Don't say such things.

382
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:16,390
You're disappointing me.

383
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:19,860
The moment I brought you home after your parents passed away,

384
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:23,485
you automatically became my daughter.

385
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,855
I know.

386
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:30,825
I guess I wanted to act like a baby since I hadn't seen you in a while.

387
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,235
Is that right?

388
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:13,835
This is from President Kang.

389
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,995
"You are a merciless liar,"

390
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:38,025
"Cathy."

391
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:41,395
"Why did you betray my heart?"

392
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:44,365
"What right did you have to leave me?"

393
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,075
"What right?"

394
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,975
"Tell me."

395
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:58,345
"You ripped us apart with your own hands."

396
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,315
"When you ripped open your heart,"

397
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:05,785
"you ripped open mine as well."

398
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:16,965
This is it for today.

399
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,075
The story will continue next time.

400
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,265
Are you trying to run away from me?

401
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:24,835
Don't lie to me. Don't.

402
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,090
I told you to stay put.

403
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:32,575
Stay put!

404
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:59,320
So this is the painting...

405
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,975
you chose?

406
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,975
"I will die tomorrow"

407
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,485
What was that all of a sudden?

408
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:14,815
That's what that flower means.

409
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:19,395
Really?

410
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:26,235
But why is it named "A Self-portrait"?

411
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,450
- Hey. - Ma Ri, Ma Ri!

412
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:12,050
Hey, your painting was chosen!

413
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:13,620
- What? - Remember when you asked me...

414
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,620
to hand in your painting for the exhibition?

415
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,390
Your "Self-portrait"...

416
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,860
was chosen!

417
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:23,100
- Really? - I'm so excited for you!

418
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:26,225
They called me just now!

419
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,095
What will you do about the awards ceremony?

420
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,325
Let's meet and talk.

421
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:47,175
(GH Sanitarium)

422
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,440
I don't want them...

423
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:03,110
to become even busier than they were like the last time when I came.

424
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,725
I'm going to spend some time with my mom, so don't follow me.

425
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:24,015
The door is closing.

426
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:51,305
I don't need anything in this world,

427
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,575
but you, Ma Ri!

428
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:59,385
Ma Ri, Ma Ri!

429
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:05,700
Hey, do we really have to meet in secret every single time?

430
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:08,140
And what's up with using a pay phone in this day and age?

431
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:09,595
I'm sorry.

432
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:12,310
Can you tell me about the exhibition first?

433
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:13,835
All right.

434
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:16,410
Honey, I'm here.

435
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,465
Come here, baby.

436
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:22,135
It's my 30th boyfriend.

437
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,550
He's five years younger than me.

438
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:26,045
- Hello. - Hello.

439
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:28,820
Gosh, why are you so adorable?

440
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:30,790
Stop it. Stop it.

441
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:32,730
You're so adorable. Do it to me.

442
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:34,755
(GH Sanitarium)

443
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,025
President Kang.

444
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:43,795
We've located her.

445
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:47,395
The bodyguards only found out later that she had run away.

446
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,405
Let's go.

447
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:18,825
She's so attractive. She's tall and beautiful.

448
00:48:18,913 --> 00:48:21,495
But she's terrible at drawing.

449
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,375
Who are you?

450
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:36,415
Well, who are you?

451
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:39,085
I'm her husband.

452
00:48:49,209 --> 00:48:51,495
No. Go to the office.

453
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,535
You looked...

454
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:37,745
gorgeous back there.

455
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:39,775
Especially, when you smiled.

456
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:41,515
It reminded me...

457
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:43,785
how you were before we got married.

458
00:49:44,298 --> 00:49:46,185
You used to always smile like that.

459
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:51,885
Please show me...

460
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,225
that smile again.

461
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:56,665
And don't show it to other men.

462
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,410
He's my friend's boyfriend. We met for the first time today.

463
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,935
You're lying again.

464
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:04,105
What if...

465
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:06,505
the bodyguards didn't see your mother...

466
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:08,935
taking a walk with her nurse?

467
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:12,705
Don't tell me you're planning to run away again.

468
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,190
This is why I have to be like this.

469
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:18,845
I have to assign bodyguards, protect you, and receive reports.

470
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:23,155
In the meantime,

471
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,725
you won't be visiting your mother alone.

472
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,025
- What? - I'll be going with you...

473
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,165
when you visit her.

474
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,135
I won't allow you to go alone.

475
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,975
I can go wherever I want.

476
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,575
Whether it be to meet my mom or my friends,

477
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:45,475
it's up to me. It's my free will!

478
00:51:10,084 --> 00:51:11,465
Fine.

479
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:13,975
Hit my face.

480
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:17,075
Beat this face...

481
00:51:18,392 --> 00:51:20,345
that you love so much...

482
00:51:20,894 --> 00:51:22,745
and mar it.

483
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,245
Destroy it completely.

484
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,215
Who drew this?

485
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,285
Why is this flower...

486
00:51:30,437 --> 00:51:32,085
a self-portrait?

487
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:35,825
I wished someone would hear...

488
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,765
my desperate signal for help.

489
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:44,835
Please grab onto this helpless life that has bloomed...

490
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,035
on the edge of a cliff.

491
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:49,575
I will...

492
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:52,050
die tomorrow.

493
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:53,915
("Cistus", I will die tomorrow.)
