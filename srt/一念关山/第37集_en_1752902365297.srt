1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The wind blows the clouds away, the mountain rises and falls.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The heart is with the sword and the sword falls.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Watching the eternal night, the sky is bright.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The devil is going to make things worse.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The wind blows the clouds away, the mountain rises and falls.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The heart is with the sword and the sword falls.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Watching the eternal night, the sky is bright.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The devil is going to make things worse.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The heart is with the sword and the sword falls.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The devil is going to make things worse.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The devil is going to make things worse.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The devil is going to make things worse.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll listen to you.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The heart.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Exactly.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've brought Sun Luo back.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Da Hui, take him down!

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Father, save me!

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What are you going to do?

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why don't you ask your father and son?

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What have you done outside Tianmen Pass?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What do you mean? Tianmen Pass?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It has something to do with the North Korean.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hurry!

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Kill!

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who are you?

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What do you want?

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm Ning Yuan Zhou, the leader of Da Wu Six Sects.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm here today to ask you to send troops to the river

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and fight against the North Korean.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The North Korean is here?

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Li Zhen Ye, tell the people what you did in Tianmen Pass.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you don't...

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not me! It's my father!

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Who?

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's the one who told me to let the North Korean in!

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You son of a bitch!

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He said that the government has been dissatisfied with him lately.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He's willing to use 50,000 taels of silver, 100,000 grains of grain and a few cities

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to trade with the North Koreans.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
First, let the Duke of Chu lose to them.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then the North Koreans pretend to lose to my father!

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Shut up! You're talking nonsense!

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is Li Sun.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He asked Li Zhen Ye to write a letter to the North Koreans.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There's his personal seal on it.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There's also a document that he wrote with Li Zhen Ye

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
when he opened Tianmen Pass.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He's now locked in the temple's basement.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can interrogate him anytime.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Your Majesty, you're really...

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My dear subjects!

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The last time you killed a traitor, you dare not kill me!

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This time...

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sister Ren, you're not dead yet.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're still alive.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sister Ren, I'm the only son of the Queen Mother.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You still have the nerve to mention your mother?

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Everyone, look carefully.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is the end of the country.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,360
CHALLENGE

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
THE You-Chang could not stand up to us the way I did it.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You killed him to kill his father.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will show them this is what I'm马赛征 Woo gray

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
for you and Stay in the dream of him.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:43,980
classic

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If you want to live today, you must write a criminal record.

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You must issue a warning to the An family.

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You must immediately send troops to drive out the Northern Plains.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am the ruler of a country.

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How can I let you, a person from a countryless country, do nothing?

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you think that once you collude with the Northern Plains,

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
you will still have a way out?

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Today, either you die here,

75
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
or the next move is the most urgent,

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and the troops will be sent to the river.

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Bring the pen and ink.

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Take a good look.

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How can a person from a country be so arrogant?

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
His Majesty has admitted that the Northern Plains has entered the border.

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No matter what, we must fight the enemy.

82
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Wait!

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Master, there is a trap here.

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You must not be fooled by him.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wu Yi!

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Go!

87
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The old wound of the suspect,

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think the pulse of the other side is also problematic.

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Protect the Emperor!

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Protect the Emperor!

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Take him away.

92
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, no.

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Uncle.

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Tong Guang's family is late.

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Uncle, don't worry.

96
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Tong Guang will surely follow your will

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and serve the Lord.

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He will do his best to assist the Third Prince.

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What's going on?

100
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Your Majesty!

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
His Majesty's large-scale court affairs are unstable.

102
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The Third Prince will be the first to take the throne.

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
When will His Majesty take the throne?

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Is there another Prince?

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Or do you think

106
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
as the grandson of the royal family,

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
he is more suitable than the Third Prince?

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Your Majesty, what do you think?

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I can testify.

110
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
His Majesty summoned Duke Qing to the palace last night.

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Duke Qing was deeply involved in the royal family's blood.

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He was also granted the state's credit.

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
From now on, he will do his best to assist the Third Prince.

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was there at that time.

115
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Any other questions?

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
In that case,

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I would like to

118
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
send off the late Emperor to the heaven.

119
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Send off the late Emperor to the heaven!

120
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Your Majesty, please let me go.

121
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I killed His Majesty without asking for his permission.

122
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But I won't regret it.

123
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because only cutting grass and removing roots is the best way.

124
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I should have done it right. Otherwise...

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He should have died.

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Isn't it good that you have the power now?

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I would rather not do it.

128
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But you can't miss this great opportunity.

129
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Duke Qing is invincible, but you can lead the army.

130
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
As long as you defeat the Northern Plains, you will be the rightful ruler of the country.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you still let His Majesty live, you will only escape one way.

132
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Rather than being trapped, it is better to take a step.

133
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I made the decision. I deserve to die.

134
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will be punished by His Majesty.

135
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Even if I die,

136
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I won't regret it.

137
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You have already taken a wrong path.

138
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why should I still want your life?

139
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Just die with me.

140
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:20,780
Ah!

141
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:31,280
The former Emperor took away my title to the next state of loving another.

142
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,140
The position of the king

143
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,200
An arrows stuck in the liunar

144
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:58,020
The

145
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,120
R Jade

146
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
I don't agree with you.

147
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,620
Me too.

148
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,340
Yes, I don't agree with you.

149
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,020
Why?

150
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
I don't want to listen to you.

151
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,220
I've also cleaned up

152
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,620
some of the old cloths of the prince.

153
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,020
Thank you.

154
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,020
I know you'll help me most of the time.

155
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,020
But I didn't expect you to help him so thoroughly.

156
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,620
In my grandfather's generation,

157
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,420
there were ten men of the Deng family,

158
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,220
eight of them died in the hands of the North Korean.

159
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,020
Since his father and son

160
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,620
dared to let the North Korean in,

161
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,220
they are not worthy of being

162
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,420
the ruler of Deng Hui.

163
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,620
I know you'll do it,

164
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,820
but I didn't expect it to be so fast.

165
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,820
This position is not easy to take.

166
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,420
You'd better do it yourself.

167
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
Yan Xiang.

168
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,620
The imperial decree to make you the Empress Dowager

169
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,620
is already on the way.

170
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,620
The first family will be killed by King Xi.

171
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,220
The first month will be sealed by 300 families.

172
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,820
I have already fulfilled my promise in advance.

173
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,620
I will not let you die.

174
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,820
I will not let you die.

175
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,420
I have already fulfilled my promise in advance.

176
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,620
I also hope that the Empress Dowager

177
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,820
can take good care of His Majesty

178
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,220
according to our previous agreement.

179
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,420
It's an emergency.

180
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
I will immediately lead the army to support your brother.

181
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,420
In the future,

182
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,620
don't do anything that makes me unhappy.

183
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Otherwise,

184
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
don't blame me for not thinking about the past.

185
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
The Empress Dowager

186
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Episode 18

187
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Master.

188
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,020
I know it's not right.

189
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,820
But after today,

190
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,820
Yuan Zheng and He Xian will die together.

191
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,620
I didn't expect to see you alive.

192
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,020
I can only say goodbye to you in this way.

193
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Even if I have two times the weakness of the golden hair,

194
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,420
don't expect me to be the old man.

195
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Now,

196
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,020
let go of Ning Yuan Zhong immediately.

197
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,020
I will let him go.

198
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
This is the antidote for Ruan Jin San.

199
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,020
Come, eat it.

200
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Li Dong Wei Xia,

201
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,020
I will go handle the matter between me and him.

202
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
The Empress Dowager

203
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
The Empress Dowager

204
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,620
The nine-story prison in Zhaoyu can't keep you.

205
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
If I had known,

206
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,420
I should have broken your skull.

207
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,620
Even if I go to the eighteenth hell,

208
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
I will come back to kill you.

209
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
The Empress Dowager

210
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
The Empress Dowager

211
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,620
The first two moves are to use teeth to bite.

212
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,220
The last move is to revenge for the abduction of a wife.

213
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Li Tong Guang,

214
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,420
you are a coward.

215
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,420
You dare to use those despicable tricks to threaten her,

216
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
to force her.

217
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,420
You don't deserve to be a man.

218
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,220
Li Dong Wei Xia,

219
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,420
even if I don't deserve it,

220
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,220
I still don't regret it.

221
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,020
Unlike you,

222
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,820
you are so coward.

223
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
You dare not kill the old man.

224
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,020
You are wrong.

225
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,620
This is not called coward.

226
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,820
This is called a gentleman who does what he does and does not.

227
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,020
It's good to let you go,

228
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,020
it's good to let him go.

229
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,820
It's just that sometimes,

230
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
you don't kill,

231
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,820
you have to kill to save more lives.

232
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Li Tong Guang,

233
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,020
if you want to become a real man,

234
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,620
you have to let go of some obsession.

235
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,420
If you want to become a king from a man,

236
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,620
you have to see the lives of the people more important than your own.

237
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Otherwise,

238
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,220
if it's not for your power to fight the enemy,

239
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,020
do you think the reincarnation of my six-stripe sugar

240
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,820
will let you go?

241
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Hurry up.

242
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,020
Our Ruyi is still beautiful in red.

243
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,220
In the future, when we worship the sugar,

244
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,620
you have to wear it like this, too.

245
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Is that okay?

246
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
No.

247
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,020
We are not worshiping the sugar in the future,

248
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
but now,

249
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
immediately,

250
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
immediately.

251
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,620
Okay.

252
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,820
There is no beauty around here,

253
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,820
but there is heaven and earth as evidence,

254
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,420
and the red desert is the border.

255
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,820
Ren Ruyi, Ren Niangzi,

256
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,620
are you willing to marry Xiao Ke to Yuen Zhou?

257
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,820
The two of us will be together forever,

258
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,420
and we will protect the land together,

259
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,420
and we will live together in the red city.

260
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,620
I, Ren Ruyi,

261
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,020
will follow the path of heaven and earth.

262
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
I will follow the path of heaven and earth.

263
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,020
How are the two worships?

264
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,020
The three worships will make the heaven and earth more beautiful,

265
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,820
and we will live together for a hundred years.

266
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,220
I'm here.

267
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,220
The Three Ways of Heaven and Earth

268
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
Pass my order.

269
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,420
I will summon Yu Ling,

270
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,420
Dian Qian,

271
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,020
Fei Qi, and San Ying to enter the city,

272
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,220
and kill all the tribes in the east and the middle of the desert,

273
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
and leave the city as soon as possible.

274
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
But...

275
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,620
the tribe in the east and the middle of the desert

276
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,420
will not be willing to send troops at this time.

277
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,420
Do you want to settle down in the country

278
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
and wait for a few days

279
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,220
to fight against the enemy?

280
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,420
If you want to delay the great cause of Wei State

281
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,620
because of the Slyr alone,

282
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,420
what's the difference between you and that old man?

283
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,420
If they really don't want to go,

284
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,020
just let them go.

285
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,220
Even if there are only a few thousand Yu Ling troops

286
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,620
and the angry Sha Xi tribe,

287
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,420
I will fight for it myself.

288
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,620
At worst,

289
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,620
I will be left alone on the stone tree,

290
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,620
and die in the battle.

291
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,020
You won't be alone in the battle.

292
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,820
Duke Qing,

293
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,820
I am here to read the Great Wu State.

294
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
Leave.

295
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,820
According to the six secret reports,

296
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,220
the North Chinese people have come back.

297
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,220
Please order all tribes to send troops outside the city.

298
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,620
My brother is in the Qingzhen River.

299
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,620
So I am ordered to be the messenger.

300
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,020
I am here to read the Great Wu State.

301
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,220
This letter is a double-edged sword

302
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,820
between my brother and Dan Yang.

303
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,220
It says that the North Chinese people are under the iron ladder.

304
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,220
They are not men, women, old and young.

305
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,220
They are all dead.

306
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,220
It is said that

307
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,820
I am willing to make a new alliance with your state,

308
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
and fight against the enemy

309
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,620
with the power of the whole state.

310
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,020
I will discuss with the officials in the court

311
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,220
and formally restore the state.

312
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,420
The military situation is in a state of chaos.

313
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
You can send the letter back now.

314
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,220
Say,

315
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,620
I appreciate your help.

316
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
I will do everything

317
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,620
for your sake.

318
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Jingru.

319
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,420
Why don't you go down?

320
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,820
Because I still want to ask you for something.

321
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
What is it?

322
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Marriage certificate.

323
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,420
I want to marry you.

324
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
Aren't you worried that you will not be able to succeed?

325
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,220
You are not convinced?

326
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
I am not convinced.

327
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,220
Are you not convinced?

328
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,820
I am the consort of the emperor.

329
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,620
As long as I marry you,

330
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,620
the whole Wu State

331
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,020
will be your back.

332
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,220
With this certificate,

333
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,220
and my two brothers' aid,

334
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,420
no one in the whole Dan will dare to question you.

335
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,340
With this letter?

336
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
I can так esustatyr with you

337
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,020
even if I have to die.

338
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,180
I will send the примuation

339
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,220
left by Sister Ruyi.

340
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Don't worry, I don't like you.

341
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,220
But I will be your wife and protect Da'an for you.

342
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,220
I will also help my brothers and Yuan Lu,

343
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,220
and myself,

344
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,220
to protect Da'an, who I love the most.

345
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,220
Jin Feng.

346
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
Jin Feng.

347
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Jin Feng.

348
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Jin Feng.

349
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,220
17 days later, Yang Yang and Li Tong helped me to return to the capital.

350
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
I have a plan.

351
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,220
On the 18th, Li Tong Guang and Zhao San Wan will be in charge.

352
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,220
On the same day, the former king of North Korea will return to the capital.

353
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,220
King of Sha Xi and Liu Dao Tang will fight against the enemy.

354
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,220
It seems that we have to hurry up.

355
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Master, there is another news.

356
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,220
The King of Sha Xi and Liu Dao Tang will fight against the enemy.

357
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Who is it?

358
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Hold on, or no one will come back alive.

359
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,220
No, the emperor was captured by the North Korean.

360
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Emperor, the emperor was captured by the North Korean.

361
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Emperor.

362
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,220
The emperor was captured by the North Korean.

363
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,220
What are you doing?

364
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,220
The emperor was captured by the North Korean.

365
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
Emperor, the emperor.

366
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Emperor.

367
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
Who is it?

368
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
Emperor.

369
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
Remember my name.

370
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,220
I am the most handsome man in the world.

371
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
Yu Shi San.

372
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
We won.

373
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
We won.

374
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
We won.

375
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
We won.

376
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,220
We won.

377
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,220
We won.

378
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
We won.

379
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
We won.

380
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
We won.

381
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
We won.

382
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
On the night of the sixth year of Wu Yong You,

383
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,220
the two armies of Wu An met in the river of Shiyun

384
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,220
and broke through the North Korean army.

385
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,220
They were captured by the left king.

386
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
They were captured by the left king.

387
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
They were captured by the left king.

388
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
They were captured by the right king.

389
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
You are so stupid.

390
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
You came back at the right time.

391
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,220
Thanks to everyone for their help,

392
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,220
we could fight against the North Korean soldiers.

393
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:22,200
dominated North corps with蹈a

394
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
You're a hero.

395
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Right?

396
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Hero, put it down.

397
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
His Majesty is willing to fight the enemy.

398
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
We are willing to listen to you.

399
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Hero, you've worked hard.

400
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Have some food.

401
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Thank you, grandma.

402
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
He's over there.

403
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,220
Thank you.

404
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,220
Thank you, grandma.

405
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,220
Little brother.

406
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,220
Let's go.

407
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,220
Here, here.

408
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,220
What's wrong with Zhao Ying?

409
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
He's Chu Yue's father.

410
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
Chu Yue is the daughter of Jin Mi.

411
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Hurry up.

412
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,220
Jin Mi is...

413
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
So you're here.

414
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
You're playing tricks on me?

415
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
This is the commander of the Six Great Tang.

416
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,220
He's come up with a trick to disguise as a Northern-South official.

417
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,220
This is my son, Chu Xu.

418
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Nice to meet you.

419
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,220
It's your first time on the battlefield.

420
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Learn from him.

421
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,220
Sure.

422
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,220
I'm flattered.

423
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
Do you know what this brother's name is?

424
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,220
My name is Yu...

425
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
23?

426
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
How can he have such a strange name?

427
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,220
Forget it.

428
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Come on, let's drink.

429
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
Come on, drink.

430
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Cheers.

431
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,220
Come on, cheers.

432
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,220
Your Majesty, I'll take my leave.

433
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,220
It's fine.

434
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
You weren't hurt.

435
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,220
I told you to rest in the clinic.

436
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Why are you here?

437
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,220
I heard that you've won the battle.

438
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Of course I couldn't help it.

439
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
Yuan Xiaolu, Qian Zhao, Sun Lang and others.

440
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,220
Search for her.

441
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,740
Neeyuan喆

442
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,220
If it's destined to be apart

443
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
There's more news for you

444
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
The yearning is gone

445
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
All the thoughts in my heart

446
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,220
are broken into pieces

447
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,220
How many times have we been separated

448
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,220
There's nowhere to escape from love and hatred

449
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,220
But the eyes are filled with the sun

450
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,220
How can I run away from the path of life

451
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,220
Only one left

452
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
You and I are in a dream

453
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,220
The wind blows over the hill

454
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,220
The stars are like the frost

455
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,220
I'm sorry

456
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
I'm sorry

457
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Su Long

458
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,220
Who is the one who is fighting with the stars

459
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
If it's destined to be apart

460
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,220
There's more news for you

461
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
The yearning is gone

462
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:54,220
If it's destined to be apart

463
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
What's wrong?

464
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,220
Nothing

465
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
This letter tells you

466
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
It will affect your recovery

467
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
I can see through people's hearts

468
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
But I never found the wrong way

469
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:21,220
I know Yuan Lu will leave before I do

470
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
But I never thought he would do this

471
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
Shi San told me

472
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,220
Su Long must be very proud when he left

473
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
If it wasn't for him

474
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220
They wouldn't have killed the King of the Apes

475
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,220
The yearning is gone

476
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,220
It's hard to find peace in this life

477
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,220
The yearning is gone

478
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:51,220
It's hard to find peace in this life

479
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
The yearning is gone

480
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,220
It's hard to find peace in this life

481
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
The yearning is gone

482
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
Drinking again?

483
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
You don't want the noodles?

484
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Here

485
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Alright

486
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,220
I'll drink with you today

487
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
Cheers

488
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
Tell me

489
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
What's up?

490
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,220
What's up?

491
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,220
It's from Qian

492
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
Yuan Lu

493
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
He sent a letter and put his own letter in

494
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,220
You're the boss

495
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,220
You should keep it

496
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,220
I'm sorry

497
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
It's boring to drink with just the two of us

498
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,220
Cheers

499
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,220
It's boring to drink with just the two of us

500
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,220
Cheers

501
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:08,220
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is snowy

502
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,220
The night is dark and the people are sad

503
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,220
The eyes are sad and the eyes are sad

504
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

505
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

506
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,220
The clouds are sad

507
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,220
Here, have some dumplings

508
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,220
Thanks

509
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,220
You're welcome

510
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,220
The dumplings are delicious

511
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,220
Let me try

512
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Sit down

513
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,220
Let me try

514
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,220
You can have some dumplings

515
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,220
No

516
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,220
No

517
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,220
Wei asked me to have dumplings

518
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,220
I forgot

519
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,220
Eat it

520
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:06,220
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is snowy

521
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,220
The eyes are sad and the eyes are sad

522
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

523
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

524
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

525
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

526
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

527
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

528
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,220
How can I be sad?

529
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,220
It's always you

530
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,220
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is snowy

531
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

532
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,220
The clouds are sad

533
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,220
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is snowy

534
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

535
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,220
The end of the night is the end of the sky

536
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,220
The sky is filled with the stars

537
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,220
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is snowy

538
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

539
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

540
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:21,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

541
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:29,220
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is snowy

542
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

543
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,220
The eyes are sad and the people are sad

544
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:46,220
The wind blows the cloud and the sky is snowy

545
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,220
The decadent cloud is the emerald

546
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,220
The wind blows back and forth

547
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,220
The snow is falling

548
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:02,220
How many years have passed?

549
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:10,220
I have no one to share my life with

550
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:25,220
I have no one to share my life with
