00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What do you want to do?

10
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Guards

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am Zhu Yiwei, the former Left Envoy Ren Xin

12
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Where is the Envoy?

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I am Wang Donglai, the Prime Minister

14
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now I am the Envoy of the State

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Ren Xin, do you know that detaining the Emperor is a grave crime?

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, it is a grave crime

17
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Li Zi also framed me to kill the former Empress

18
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That is also a grave crime

19
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I was not afraid five years ago

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Will I be afraid now?

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is really...

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ren Xin, this place is already a dead end

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can't escape

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But if you can destroy the Xuanya

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I can't

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Your Majesty

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Li Zi

28
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I want you to speak out loud in front of the officials and the envoy

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why did the former Empress die?

30
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why did the former Empress die?

31
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Empress died in the fire

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This...

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What is this?

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is there something wrong with the former Empress?

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What happened?

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you think that the Emperor died in the human race?

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Look carefully

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
These are the original documents of the former Envoy of the State and the Grand Tutor's Martial Art Pillar

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It clearly says that the former Empress died in the fire

40
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The Emperor clearly knew about the death of the Empress

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But why did he have to set the crime of killing the Empress?

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't pretend to be so shocked

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He colluded with the Northern Plains privately

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But was discovered by the Empress

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So he set the fire and killed the Empress

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't believe that no one in the court knows

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The Empress died because she hated him for colluding with the enemy privately

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So she didn't want to be the Empress anymore

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And also be the wife of this shameless person

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ren Xin

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Even if you are wronged, you can't take over the Holy Palace

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Xu Jing

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The thunder and rain are not the grace of the Holy Emperor

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are not the grace of the Holy Emperor

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thunder and rain

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What a big joke

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You think I did this today

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Just for my own people?

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are wrong

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Li Sun not only changed the history books

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To hide the truth of his own murder and murder

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And these years

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Pay attention to what the Wei State is doing

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
All from the history books

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
These files

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Recorded the past Zhu Yi Wei

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
With blood and life

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Changed all the skills

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
These years, but not seeing the sun

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Always locked in Zhu Yi Wei's side room

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Deng Hui

72
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have never colluded with the people

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Why did the Emperor dare to kill Zhu Yi Wei outside the palace?

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But dare not tell the world all these skills

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because since the previous emperor

76
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just treat Zhu Yi Wei as a slave who does not need any respect

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Even if Zhu Yi Wei is not afraid of life and death

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Destroyed the Xun Wang rebellion

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Defeated 160 people and defeated the Jiannan Army

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Even if you kill other countries

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Fengxiang Dingnan Baosheng Three Military Commanders

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
To save the South Ping King, the Queen Dowager of Chu

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But not worthy to leave a little trace on the history books

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But even if Zhu Yi Wei did it all

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is it not worthy to have the credit for Da'an?

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
These things

87
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You know

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you willing to?

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He can do this to Zhu Yi Wei

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Zhu Yi Wei

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will not treat you like this in the future

92
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Enough

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Renxin

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What do you want?

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If you want to kill me, do it

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I am the master of the country

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do it

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The one who does great work

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No one is planning

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The one who does great things

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Naturally do not fear small problems

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But we are not small problems

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We are living people

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Look carefully

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:25,700
We burn the

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Everyone

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If the emergency in the side room is gone

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We don't have to do it anymore

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There are antidotes in the box at the door

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
As long as you take it

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We will not be controlled anymore

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Everyone, don't hesitate anymore

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hurry up and go with me

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's wrong with you?

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm so tired

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm so tired

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm so tired

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Not only they don't have to do it

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Without the emergency plan, you can also do it

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We set the fire

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It doesn't matter who you are

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Everyone is going to the palace gate to watch

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Renxin took the throne

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Zhu Yi Wei is on behalf of us

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Zhu Yi Wei has been born and died for so many years

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But the credit has not been recorded at all

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
In the history book

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Renxin is not happy with the situation

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He is angry with us

130
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Is that true?

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,460
I have been

132
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
Let's go

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's snowing

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's snowing

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is the official property of Zhu Yi Wei

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Listen up, everyone

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is the cure formula used by the court to control the secret medicine of white swan

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There are medicines prepared before outside the gates of the northeast, northwest and four cities

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now Zhu Yi Wei's command room has been destroyed

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is no more thing that can control you in the world

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you don't want to stay in Zhu Yi Wei

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The world will be yours

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's true

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't move

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Be honest with me

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Renxin

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What?

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
When you need Zhu Yi Wei

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You think he is dirty

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
When I care about Zhu Yi Wei's freedom

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can't bear to leave

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Everyone

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What I did today

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I believe what I did

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It has nothing to do with anyone

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Stop it

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You can't hurt the holy palace

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't worry

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I am not as heartless as him

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
After all, killing him will cause the country to be in chaos

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If all countries take advantage of the situation

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's another round of life and death

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Then you release the emperor right away

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't be afraid

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I won't let you die

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Kill him

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Your Majesty

168
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Your Majesty

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What are you doing?

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I should die

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Go

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Go and catch Renxin back

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Otherwise, I will kill you

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I will also kill your three generations of ancestors

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Go

176
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, Your Majesty

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wang Dulei

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Your Majesty

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What happened today is done by Xiao Xiao

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Go

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know what you should say

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I know

184
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Send the emperor's edict

185
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What happened tonight was done by Xiao Xiao

186
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
All officials are not allowed to enter

187
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The one who breaks the edict will be executed

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But this

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Your Majesty

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yang Xinyuan ran away

191
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What?

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How dare you let him run away

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What did your ancestors do?

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What did you do?

195
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hurry up

196
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Tell the boss to let him catch Renxin back

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What about my Niu Jiaohao?

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What about my Niu Jiaohao?

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
My Niu Jiaohao

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Niu Jiaohao

201
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you all deaf?

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Are you deaf?

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I am guilty

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But the emperor has

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Has

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I am guilty

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But the emperor has

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Has

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I am guilty

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But the emperor has

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Has

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Has

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Has

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Has

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Has

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Has

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Has

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Has

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Has

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Has

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Has

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Has

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Has

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Has

225
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Has

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Has

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Has

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Has

229
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Has

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Has

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Has

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Has

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Has

234
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Has

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Has

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Boss

237
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He is dead

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Second

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I kicked him out

240
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Don't follow me.

241
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't follow me.

242
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
From now on, our food is not for free.

243
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You don't have to dress up like this.

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm going to sell the color.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Great.

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Where is it?

247
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I got it.

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I got it.

249
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Where are you going to go?

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm going.

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Go.

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Honorable Superior.

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't call me Honorable Superior anymore.

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Everything has passed.

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
From now on, I'm just Ruyi.

256
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're just Meiniang.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't worry about me.

258
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll help you get out of the safe zone.

259
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
After a while, the wind and the waves are quiet.

260
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We'll go again.

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You're going to meet with Ningyuan?

262
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes.

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I made such a big noise.

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I also want to help them with some military affairs.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I will help them get out of the city.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Take care.

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Take care.

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Stop.

269
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Stop.

270
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
General Li Tongguo of the Imperial Guards is here.

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There are spies coming to the city.

272
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
To prevent internal chaos,

273
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
all defense units can be controlled by the Imperial Guards.

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Defense units are our duty.

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We can't give up easily.

277
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There are spies coming to the city.

278
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Something is wrong.

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Look at this.

280
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I have to go find Master.

281
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Come back.

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Tong.

283
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The thing with Sister Ru Yi is finished.

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Tong.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The people of the Long River Lake are in position at the gate.

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Stand up.

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What's wrong?

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The thing with Sister Ru Yi is finished.

289
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Tong.

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The thing with Sister Ru Yi is finished.

291
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Tong.

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The thing with Sister Ru Yi is finished.

293
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Stand up.

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We should do as planned.

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
When the Imperial Guards and the Imperial Guard are in trouble,

296
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
we will escape while we can.

297
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

298
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Go.

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You escort His Majesty.

300
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I will go save A-Yang.

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But...

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I have made up my mind.

303
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Listen to me.

304
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hurry up.

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Master.

306
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Master.

307
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Master.

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Master.

309
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Master.

310
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's you.

311
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Where is Master?

312
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We found Prince Li.

313
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Hurry up.

314
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hurry up.

315
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I know you.

316
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You are Chang Qing Hou who is in charge of the Imperial Guard.

317
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Why did you people of An State set fire to the valley?

318
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Why?

319
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Don't listen to Prince Li.

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Does Prince Li want to kill himself?

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Go to save the fire.

322
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
If you don't kill him,

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I will punish you for murdering other ministers.

324
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Get out.

325
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Master.

326
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They all left.

327
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I stayed behind.

328
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I didn't ask you that.

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Where is Master?

330
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Where did he go?

331
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He didn't tell me.

332
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I only know he went to the palace.

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He went to the palace?

334
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Shouldn't they be with you?

335
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Where are you taking me?

336
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Shut up.

337
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If it weren't for you,

338
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
other than Master and Shang Xian,

339
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I wouldn't have dared to say a word to you.

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yuan Zhuang.

341
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Ruyi.

342
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Are you okay?

343
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm fine.

344
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm fine.

345
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm fine.

346
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm fine.

347
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm fine.

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm fine.

349
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm fine.

350
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm fine.

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm fine.

352
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's good that you're fine.

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Although the lamp is hard to deal with,

354
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I have the red dust you gave me.

355
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Why are you here?

356
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Didn't we agree to meet outside the city?

357
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Wu Di didn't save him?

358
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He has been rescued.

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But there was a little mistake in the middle.

360
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Ying stayed in the private hospital for us.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I said I was going to save him.

362
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm going to save him with you.

363
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Then let's go together.

364
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Hurry up.

365
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

366
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's go.

367
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let's go.

368
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You go, I go.

369
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Why?

370
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The signal that has been thinking about is the signal from the S.H.A.R.D.

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Andy doesn't believe Zhuyi and the Imperial Guards anymore.

372
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So he transferred the most elite medical staff among his own troops.

373
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I thought they wouldn't come so fast.

374
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But what just passed was the S.H.A.R.D.

375
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Since they have gone to the palace,

376
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
they must have guarded the gate.

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
With them,

378
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm afraid that the Imperial Guards can't take over the city as planned.

379
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And let the S.H.A.R.D. out.

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's not necessary for us to save Ying.

381
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's your duty to send your master out of Ando safely.

382
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Otherwise, if something goes wrong there,

383
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
you have to take care of it.

384
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
No, Ru Yan.

385
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You are too dangerous.

386
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We both understand.

387
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
This is the best choice.

388
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
As long as Ying is alive,

389
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I will keep her safe.

390
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Master Ning.

391
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Please believe that a person does things.

392
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Okay.

393
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I believe you.

394
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm willing to do anything.

395
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You must keep your promise.

396
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'll wait for you.

397
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll wait for you for a moment.

398
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If you don't come,

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I will find you under the imperial spring.

400
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I will wait for you in the imperial spring.

401
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I will wait for you in the imperial spring.

402
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,840
Did you hear?

403
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,420
She proposed.

404
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,240
Stand more μου careful.

405
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,520
Add this?

406
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,680
Bring back king Li!

407
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
only trust the sword in my hand

408
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,800
Since I am the secret messenger of the Wu State

409
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,600
I can't give the king of Li to others

410
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,540
If you blame me

411
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,060
General Li

412
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,860
will you take the responsibility for me?

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Your Highness

414
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Your Highness

415
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,800
I suddenly can't breathe

416
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,800
Bad, smoke is in the lungs, the heart is getting weaker

417
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Hurry up and tell the doctor

418
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,300
You want to take the king of Li away, right?

419
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Ok

420
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
If he dies

421
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,240
you will tell the emperor

422
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Fine

423
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
You are cruel

424
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,860
Anyway, there are so many people watching

425
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,240
You dare not let the king of Li go

426
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,820
Immediately open the gate of the city

427
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Never let a single Wu person go

428
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Yes

429
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You

430
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
panic

431
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,140
When I figure out why you have to take over the gate of the city

432
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,900
We will all explain to the emperor

433
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,380
Go

434
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
Suddenly there are so many people

435
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,080
But brother Yuan Zhou and others

436
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
are all here

437
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Ying, Jiu Er

438
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Sister Ru Yan

439
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Master

440
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Now they are blocking the gate

441
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,840
I have to lure the King of Sha Zhong

442
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
You follow Jiu Er, he will protect you

443
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
After you settle down, come to me

444
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
I will help you clear the suspicion and get Qing Yuan

445
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Who are you?

446
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
A person of heart

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
A person of heart?

448
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't know

449
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Go

450
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Chase

451
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
All of you, go after them

452
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Go

453
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Go

454
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Go

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Go

456
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Go

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Go back with me

458
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You are late

459
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Go

460
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Go

461
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Go

462
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Go

463
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Go to the city

464
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Go

465
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Go

466
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Go

467
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Go

468
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Go

469
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Go

470
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Go

471
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Go

472
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Go

473
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Go

474
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Go

475
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Go

476
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Go

477
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Go

478
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Go

479
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Go

480
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Go

481
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Go

482
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Go

483
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Go

484
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Go

485
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Go

486
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Go

487
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Go

488
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Go

489
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
How did you come?

490
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Hurry up

491
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Hurry up

492
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Go

493
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Hurry up

494
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Hurry up

495
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Hurry up

496
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What is this sound?

497
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You two, go have a look

498
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Let us out

499
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Go

500
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Hurry up

501
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't move

502
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Stop

503
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Go back

504
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Go

505
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Let's go

506
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,500
Honey

507
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Give me your hand.

508
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,600
You are my opponent, not my enemy.

509
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,400
You all are all knights.

510
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,600
Why should I kill you?

511
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,080
Kill!

512
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,840
Kill!

513
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,720
Kill!

514
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,880
Master Ren, stop fighting!

515
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,800
Stop it, Master Ren!

516
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
Stop fighting!

517
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,000
Ren Xi,

518
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,920
as long as you drop the sword,

519
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,600
I promise to give you a happy one.

520
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,160
This time,

521
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,880
do you think I will believe you?

522
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,760
Kill!

523
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,240
Stop!

524
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,840
I'm still the immortal.

525
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,200
Are you afraid ofica?

526
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You dare to oppose me

527
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What? You want to destroy the tribe?

528
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I come here to save you, Master

529
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I said I would clear the suspicion for you

530
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and direct Qingyuan

531
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Wait, I can't escape

532
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Master, don't force me

533
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Master, don't force me

534
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I will kill you

535
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Only when I'm not here

536
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
can you turn from Jiu to Li Dongguang

537
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Dongguang

538
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Old Ning

539
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Tao'er

540
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
If you keep going, you will...

541
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's okay

542
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't worry

543
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We can't stop

544
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We must get to Liuling Village as soon as possible

545
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Let's go

546
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I hope you can

547
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I can't see

548
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
How many dreams have I had?

549
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Bring the horse here

550
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Yes

551
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I don't want to leave you

552
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Stop

553
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Where are you taking her?

554
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
His Majesty ordered to take the rebel to the court

555
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Tang Qianghou

556
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You are brave and brave

557
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You don't need to be a criminal

558
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I will tell His Majesty about this

559
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Go

560
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Go

561
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Go

562
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Go

563
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Go find a carriage

564
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yes

565
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yes.

566
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I can't forget you.

567
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Commander Deng.

568
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Do you sympathize with me

569
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
or do you feel strange

570
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
when I say that on the wall?

571
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Say less.

572
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Save your energy.

573
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm dying.

574
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm dying.

575
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I was sold to Zhu Yi Wei when I was a kid.

576
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Now I have to die for Zhu Yi Wei.

577
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I admit it.

578
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But he knew

579
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
your father died in Zhu Yi Wei's hands.

580
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But he still wants you to be the commander.

581
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Did he ever think

582
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you would feel sad

583
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and feel sad?

584
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
He asked you

585
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
to clean up Zhu Yi Wei

586
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and asked you

587
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
to be with him

588
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
like the original Zhu Yi Wei.

589
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm guilty.

590
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm guilty.

591
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You are me.

592
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'll let you take out a dog.

593
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I want your life.

594
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll also kill all three generations of your Deng family.

595
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I've checked you.

596
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You asked me to leave the air force

597
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and guard the mountain.

598
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Actually, you've had

599
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
a fierce man

600
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
who was very aggressive.

601
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But he didn't let you go.

602
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He only wanted you to be his dog

603
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and keep you by his side for the rest of your life.

604
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You don't have to force me to be with His Majesty.

605
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Don't say anything

606
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
or you'll kill yourself.

607
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
When you see His Majesty,

608
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
you'll be the one to take him in.

609
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm so stupid.

610
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm so stupid.

611
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm afraid that your Bai Que

612
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
will be out of your hands.

613
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No wonder you don't want me to die.

614
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You just want me to suffer for a long time.

615
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Don't think I can't see

616
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
why you made a scene.

617
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm afraid you want to help someone

618
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
to draw fire and delay time.

619
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You deliberately let Marquis Chang Qin hurt you

620
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because you want to give him a credit.

621
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You want to take him in and protect him.

622
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I didn't expose you.

623
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And I even talked to everyone.

624
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I've already helped you.

625
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I've helped you, too.

626
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I know.

627
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That day outside the palace,

628
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Ning Yuan Zhou said that

629
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the one who didn't want to see

630
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the good-hearted man who died for the people

631
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
was you.

632
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Why did you help me?

633
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Because I'm like you.

634
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Even if I hate you,

635
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I don't want to kill innocent people.

636
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Take this medicine.

637
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't want to die

638
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
in front of that

639
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
bad person who is so heartless.

640
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You promised me

641
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
you would give me a happy ending.

642
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
If you lie to me again,

643
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
you owe me one.

644
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This is my heart.

645
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You still remember it.

646
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You still remember it.

647
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You still remember it.

648
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
How many people have left the palace?

649
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Just half an hour ago,

650
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
there were nine ghosts in Bai Quan.

651
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
The rest are not important.

652
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Six percent.

653
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
From one to more than one percent,

654
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
three and a half percent.

655
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm here to give him the last one.

656
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's also right.

657
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
He treated you really well.

658
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
He even gave you a luxurious and rich

659
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
with his life.

660
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm here to give him

661
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
the last one.

662
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm here to give him

663
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
the last one.

664
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm here to give him

665
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
the last one.

666
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm here to give him

667
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
the last one.

668
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm here to give him

669
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the last one.

670
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Four and a half percent.

671
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Are these the words of Lord?

672
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But the ones you give

673
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
weren't what you thought.

674
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So you told me

675
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
that many people have moved

676
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
over here for headed back to there.

677
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That is not the thing I was thinking of.

678
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I will not let you explain it.

679
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But...

680
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,800
The gold strawberry

681
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,800
There is less than half of the people left in the Imperial Guards.

682
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
If you kill me again,

683
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,800
His Majesty will have no one to trust anymore.

684
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
But...

685
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
We are not friends.

686
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Why do you come here to remind me?

687
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I want to help you.

688
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
He is old.

689
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
I have planned it long ago.

690
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
It's good for you and me.

691
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Tell me about your plan.

692
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,800
His Majesty will make the second prince.

693
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
But I don't want to.

694
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,800
You come with me to support the third prince.

695
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
After all, a child

696
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,800
will not be so cold to you and me for more than ten years.

697
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,800
What do you want me to do?

698
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
Tell His Majesty

699
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,800
that you have found out that the people of Chu have been sold by the Wu Guo Group.

700
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,800
They are in Ban Lu City and want to kill me.

701
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
I know.

702
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,800
It seems that Deng Zhihui is loyal to His Majesty.

703
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,800
But that's not all.

704
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,800
It's beautiful to kill the one you love.

705
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Isn't it?

706
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
With this cup,

707
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,800
I wish you a bright future.

708
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
May you have a great war.

709
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

710
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

711
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

712
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

713
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

714
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

715
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

716
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

717
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

718
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,800
I'm afraid that the world will be destroyed.

719
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
Someone is still alive.

720
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
Someone is still a epidemic.

721
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
The world is revenue.

722
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,800
I first heard of that cure when I untenuppished in lethargy this morning.

723
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,800
I think I should get used to it.

724
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,800
I understand now that the Ji's are all prepared for the issue of warding its court.

725
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,240
I'm afraid that I'll never come back

726
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm afraid that I'll never come back

727
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:52,200
I'm afraid that I'll never come back

728
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,200
I'm afraid that I'll never come back

729
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
