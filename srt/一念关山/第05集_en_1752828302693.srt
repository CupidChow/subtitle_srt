beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

Aren't you the Imperial Guards?

38
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,340
Why are you here as the wedding dresser?

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
Who are you watching?

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,340
I was originally...

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,340
just a white dog.

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
I was lucky enough to follow you.

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,340
The fire five years ago,

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
I was going to die too.

45
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
Fortunately, there was a doctor to help me.

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
I only had a piece of my butt.

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,340
The book is right here.

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,340
Don't talk.

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Listen to me.

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Who is it?

51
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Sorry to disturb you.

52
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,340
You guys continue.

53
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Continue.

54
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
You are indeed a rich and rich lady.

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,340
You are indeed a rich and rich lady.

56
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,340
You are indeed a rich and rich lady.

57
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,340
You are indeed a rich and rich lady.

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,340
You are indeed a rich and rich lady.

59
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
Tong Guang,

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
when did you start to worry?

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
I was just a servant.

62
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Who told you to promote me?

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,340
I was really happy.

64
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,340
I was really happy.

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,340
Listen to me.

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
I'm not the one.

67
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
I'm not the one.

68
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Do you really like her?

69
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,340
Then why don't you kill her?

70
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
She's alive.

71
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,340
For the two of us, she's a shadow.

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Say something.

73
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,340
A while ago,

74
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,340
there was an hour of time

75
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
that I wrote a poem about.

76
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
I really liked it.

77
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
I remember the green gourd tree

78
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
in the garden.

79
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,340
It looked like you when it cried.

80
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Suddenly,

81
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,340
I couldn't stop myself.

82
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,340
Stop lying to me.

83
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
I'm a living person.

84
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,340
I'm standing in front of you.

85
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,340
I'm standing in front of you.

86
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
You don't even touch me.

87
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,340
He Dong Wang said

88
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
he saw you and him get away from each other.

89
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,340
You treated me

90
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
like a monster from start to finish, right?

91
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
You're just like me, right?

92
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,340
I hate the blood

93
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
on my own back.

94
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
Do you want me to say it?

95
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
Yes.

96
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
I can't rely on you too much.

97
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Because I have inferiority complex.

98
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
I just did a great thing.

99
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,340
I want to be the prime minister.

100
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,340
You're the most brilliant and famous

101
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,340
in Sha Xi Bu.

102
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,340
The most noble woman in the palace.

103
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,340
And I...

104
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,340
I'm a son.

105
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
If it weren't because you're too lonely,

106
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,340
what right do I have to stand by your side?

107
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,340
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,340
I really can't do it.

109
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,340
Father.

110
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,340
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,340
I won't do it again.

112
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,340
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I won't force you again.

115
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,340
Just this shoulder.

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,340
Just sometimes

117
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,340
let me lean on it.

118
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,340
That's enough.

119
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,340
The master is back.

120
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,340
The master is back.

121
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,340
I don't know the morning and the night.

122
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,340
The family is the most rare.

123
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,340
I'd rather die in the hands of a beauty.

124
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,340
I'm not even crazy about being a ghost.

125
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,340
Why so many years?

126
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,340
This is...

127
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
Cousin?

128
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
Oh, it's cousin.

129
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
No wonder there are so many nails.

130
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
No wonder the nails let us

131
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
go to save people.

132
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,340
What's your cousin's name?

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,340
Cousin Guixin?

134
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Her name is Ren Ruyi.

135
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,340
She went to the country with us.

136
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,340
She's also responsible for the teaching of the prince.

137
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,340
This is Qian Zhao.

138
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
She knows a little bit of everything.

139
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
This is...

140
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,340
This is not important.

141
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,340
I'm too important.

142
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,340
My name is Yu Shisan.

143
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,340
I know more than Qian Zhao.

144
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Cousin, why do you look so pale?

145
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
Are you not feeling well?

146
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Yes, she's badly injured.

147
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,340
Let her see.

148
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
How did the wound

149
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
get into the blood of the doctor?

150
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
She's a bad person from Chu.

151
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
She's a bit of a stranger to the doctor.

152
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Drink it.

153
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Cousin is a good sister.

154
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
I admire her.

155
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,340
But why isn't cousin talking?

156
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
Is she...

157
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,340
Is her throat injured?

158
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
She just doesn't want to talk to you.

159
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,340
Don't be afraid.

160
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,340
I'm very interesting.

161
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,340
Okay, let's go.

162
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,340
Okay.

163
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
If you can do it,

164
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
I'll ask Yu Lang to buy you

165
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
three bags of Zhangji Yi Gou Song.

166
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,340
Really?

167
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Really.

168
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Okay.

169
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Ruyi,

170
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,340
what's wrong?

171
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,340
This is very delicious.

172
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,340
Nothing.

173
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,340
It reminds me of an old friend.

174
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,340
Thank you.

175
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Why

176
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,340
don't they suspect my identity?

177
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,340
Because you brought it with you.

178
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
And Brother Qian showed you the medicine.

179
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,340
That means they think you're one of them.

180
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,340
You believe him that much?

181
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
He asked us to die.

182
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,340
I won't blink.

183
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
He's that good?

184
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,340
Of course.

185
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,340
We think of our family name.

186
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,340
Mother is a great teacher.

187
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
I heard she was a woman in the palace.

188
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
In terms of literature,

189
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
she can get into the imperial exam.

190
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
In terms of martial arts, she's the best.

191
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
She's a good fighter.

192
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
She's the first one

193
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,340
who became the vice-president at the age of twenty.

194
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,340
How can that be bad?

195
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Even if she's married,

196
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,340
there must be hundreds of women

197
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,340
in our six halls.

198
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,340
Really?

199
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
There's a saying

200
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
you must remember.

201
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Never fall in love with a man

202
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
in your life.

203
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
But you must have

204
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,340
a child of your own.

205
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
You're finally talking.

206
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
I'm worried.

207
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
I didn't expect

208
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,340
you to be so good.

209
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Don't call me that.

210
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Don't be so cruel.

211
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Today is a beautiful day.

212
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
It's the first day

213
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,340
you and I are going together.

214
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,260
The Saeless

215
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,580
is waiting.

216
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,140
The Flute is serious.

217
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,700
Following the Sa fabulously,

218
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,340
the Flutist sits down."

219
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
See you there, SaButi.

220
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Hmph That'smarked.

221
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
Beware of yourή

222
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
Ohh

223
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,340
Romilot

224
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,340
He's coming.

225
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
OK, Immortal.

226
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,780
Here.

227
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:18,240
about the

228
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Go.

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Toer.

230
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Toer, why do you think they started fighting like that?

231
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,240
A bridegroom has to be a master even if he is brought in by a wolf.

232
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Otherwise, it will be a mess.

233
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
I understand.

234
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Toer, you are the first wolf, and Ru Yi is the second wolf.

235
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Brother Qian is old, so he is the old wolf.

236
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
I am young, so I am the young wolf.

237
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
What about Brother 13?

238
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
The second wolf.

239
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
I am not the second wolf.

240
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,240
I want to be a wild wolf with a manly charm.

241
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Your Highness, this is Ren Ru Yi.

242
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
I hired a bridegroom for you.

243
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
He knows everything about Angu.

244
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,240
From today, he will teach you.

245
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

246
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
Qingshan.

247
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Lord Ning, why don't you discuss it with us and change the person?

248
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Because you are incompetent.

249
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I can't teach him well.

250
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
How dare you!

251
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
I am the empress's own child.

252
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I was born with Princess Xunyang.

253
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Send the bridegroom back to the capital.

254
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Yes.

255
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
What are you doing?

256
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Let go of me.

257
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Lord Ning, what's going on?

258
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
You have no choice.

259
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
This is not a discussion.

260
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
This is a notice.

261
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Yes.

262
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I... No, I...

263
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
I asked him to teach me.

264
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
This is my order.

265
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
You...

266
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
I...

267
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
What are you writing?

268
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Which great figures are there in Angu?

269
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
You will memorize them later.

270
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Why aren't you afraid of me?

271
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
You were so timid before.

272
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
You were so hesitant.

273
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Why did you ask me to stay?

274
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Tell me.

275
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Because you can control the maidservant.

276
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,240
The maidservant is very strict.

277
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
She hit you?

278
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Let me look.

279
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
I didn't know that people are like this.

280
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Why didn't you tell me?

281
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I was afraid you would find it difficult.

282
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
The maidservant was trying to remind me to listen.

283
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Yuan Lu.

284
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Send a message to the person you sent back.

285
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Before you go back to the capital,

286
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
the six pagoda's vows,

287
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
you must not miss a single day.

288
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes.

289
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Why are you crying?

290
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Lu Yi.

291
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
I already told you.

292
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Thank you.

293
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
And these years, I haven't seen Ying for a long time.

294
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
I was careless.

295
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
You don't know the tricks of women in the palace.

296
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
It's normal.

297
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
I happen to tell you.

298
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
In addition to the business team,

299
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
there are many brothers in the delegation responsible for protecting her.

300
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
After that, in the delegation...

301
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
You don't ask me how to teach her.

302
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
You don't need to ask.

303
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Since I chose to let you teach her,

304
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
I will not doubt her.

305
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Moreover,

306
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
who can understand Anguo better than the human race?

307
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I have been leaving Anguo for five years.

308
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
But you have been doing Baique for five years.

309
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Isn't that enough?

310
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
I didn't finish just now.

311
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
In order to avoid trouble,

312
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
in front of the delegation,

313
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
I said you were the female member of the six pagoda.

314
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
But in front of the thirteen pagodas,

315
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I said you were a bad person of Chu.

316
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Why don't you tell them directly

317
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
that I am Baique of Zhu Yiwei?

318
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Because I guess that

319
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
in this world,

320
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
there is no woman who wants to be

321
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
sold out by others.

322
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
You are the same.

323
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
If I have to go to the five pagoda,

324
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
I don't want to become

325
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Baique who is sold out by others.

326
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
By the way,

327
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
especially Qian Zhao,

328
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
she hates Zhu Yiwei very much.

329
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
She must not reveal her identity.

330
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Lord Ning,

331
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
you are really thoughtful.

332
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
The King of Chu

333
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
The King of Chu

334
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Tell me, how many tribes do you have in Anguo?

335
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
I know this one.

336
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
There are three tribes in Anguo.

337
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
There are Sha Xi, Sha Dong, and Sha Zhong.

338
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Which tribe is the one

339
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
that is saved by the second prince?

340
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
It is...

341
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Sha...

342
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Xi...

343
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
The one who was taken by Anran

344
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
in the Tianmen Pass war,

345
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
how many cities does he have?

346
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
From tomorrow,

347
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I will tell you

348
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
an extra hour after dinner.

349
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
If you go out again,

350
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I will give you 100 times more.

351
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
You are so kind.

352
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
You are a little girl.

353
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
A little girl.

354
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Little prince.

355
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Isn't Ruyi and the prince in good conditions?

356
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Why is the prince crying?

357
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
The one who is a teacher will be in danger.

358
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Although Ruyi punished the prince.

359
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
It doesn't mean that he will be happy with the prince.

360
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Let's go.

361
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Your Highness.

362
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Please.

363
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Please drink this cup.

364
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Wrong.

365
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
A man should drink like this.

366
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Continue eating.

367
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
I...

368
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I...I have a bad appetite.

369
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
I can't eat.

370
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Then go to the backyard.

371
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Turn around for an hour.

372
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Okay.

373
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Do you think I'm too cruel to him?

374
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
No.

375
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
You are cruel to him now.

376
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
It's better than being cruel to the people of Angu after you arrive in Angu.

377
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Besides...

378
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Forget it.

379
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Make it clear.

380
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Besides, I believe that you must have suffered more than him.

381
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
You must have suffered more.

382
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
But time is short.

383
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
He is still a child.

384
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
But time is short.

385
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
If he can learn one tenth of you.

386
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I will be satisfied.

387
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
You are so nice to me.

388
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm not used to it.

389
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
It was before.

390
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Now we are in the same boat.

391
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Of course it's different.

392
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Really?

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Anyway, there is no one else now.

394
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Why don't we sit down and drink together?

395
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Let's talk about

396
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
how to make a toast.

397
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
I have an alcohol problem.

398
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
I can't drink cold wine.

399
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Then I will help you to

400
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
heat it up.

401
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
I will help you to heat it up.

402
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
I will help you to heat it up.

403
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
I will help you to heat it up.

404
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I will help you to heat it up.

405
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
I will help you to heat it up.

406
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
I will help you to heat it up.

407
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I will help you to heat it up.

408
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
I will help you to heat it up.

409
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
I will help you to heat it up.

410
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
I will help you to heat it up.

411
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
I will help you to heat it up.

412
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
I will help you to heat it up.

413
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
I will help you to heat it up.

414
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
I will help you to heat it up.

415
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
I will help you to heat it up.

416
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
I will help you heat it.

417
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
I will help you to heat it.

418
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
I will help you to heat it.

419
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
I will help you to heat it.

420
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
I will help you to heat it.

421
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
I will help you to heat it.

422
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I will help you to heat it.

423
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I will help you to heat it.

424
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I will help you to heat it.

425
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
I will help you to heat it.

426
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I will help you to heat it.

427
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
I will help you to heat it.

428
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
I will help you to heat it.

429
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Let's take a break and continue.

430
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Okay.

431
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Why are you so obedient?

432
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Because when I first saw you,

433
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
I liked you.

434
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I will definitely listen to you.

435
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
No.

436
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
As a princess,

437
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
you are so bad at dating.

438
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
You should listen to her.

439
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
This can only mean

440
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
that you have been used to

441
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
following others.

442
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
You don't dare to resist them.

443
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
My mother and

444
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
the female officers taught me that.

445
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
They said that a woman should

446
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
be treated with respect and kindness.

447
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I am a princess, I should be treated like that.

448
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Otherwise, I will never be able to get married.

449
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Who said that a woman

450
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
should marry?

451
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
You are a princess.

452
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
You can be alone and be free forever.

453
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
But

454
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
if I don't get married,

455
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
who will take care of me?

456
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Who will play jokes with me?

457
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
How can I have a baby?

458
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
What's so good about marrying?

459
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
You can't be someone else's wife.

460
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
You have to suffer for a hundred years.

461
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
If you don't get married,

462
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
women can also have their own children.

463
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
But

464
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
people say that

465
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
I need to find a good husband.

466
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
This is the most important thing in my life.

467
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
They are lying to you.

468
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
No.

469
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I know.

470
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
But my sister-in-law will never lie to me.

471
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
She also told me that.

472
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Really?

473
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Then do you know

474
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
that Empress Xiao

475
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
wanted to send you to the netherworld?

476
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Don't say that.

477
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
She treats me so well.

478
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
She treats you well?

479
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
She knew that you are a princess

480
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
but she asked you to dress up as a man

481
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
and go to Angu.

482
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Are you really blind to those officials?

483
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
I can't even tell that you don't have a husband.

484
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
You only have a

485
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
good-looking wife

486
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
and a bad-tempered woman.

487
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
I...I am

488
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
a woman who is too hasty to die.

489
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
When you see Prince Yan,

490
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
you can tell him.

491
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Let me tell you the truth.

492
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Prince Dan Yang

493
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
doesn't want your brother to come back safely.

494
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
He wants to see

495
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
your brother's body.

496
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Then he can be

497
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
in a good mood.

498
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
The Empress doesn't want to save your brother.

499
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
She just wants to hold him for a few more months.

500
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
When the child is born,

501
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
she can respect your brother as the crown prince.

502
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
No.

503
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
She called herself Empress Dowager.

504
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
As for you and your brother,

505
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
it's best to be locked

506
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
in the dark prison of Angu.

507
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
After a few years,

508
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
they will die together.

509
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
That's why it's called being happy.

510
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
You lied to me!

511
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
You don't believe me? You can ask him.

512
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Brother Yan Zhou.

513
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
You shouldn't have told him that.

514
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
I just want him to wake up earlier.

515
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
At least he won't be a fool in the future.

516
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Yang Ying,

517
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
listen carefully.

518
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
If you don't change your

519
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
temperament right away,

520
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
you will really die.

521
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Use all your strength to eat

522
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
and get fit.

523
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Try to learn.

524
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
That's your only way to survive.

525
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Brother Yan Zhou,

526
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
is what he said true?

527
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
呀

528
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:11,360
young

529
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,360
winter

530
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:40,240
The first is the first in the East, the second is the first in the West, and the third is Li Cheng Yuan.

531
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,080
He's making progress fast.

532
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,440
It's true that Xia Meng is also going to be the first.

533
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,840
Hurry up. The wind is blowing.

534
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,400
Hold it well. Be careful.

535
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,880
How's the food?

536
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,000
Don't worry, sir. It's ready. This way, please.

537
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,480
I'm so hungry, Brother 13. How long do we have to wait to get to the border?

538
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,440
We have to get to Lingzhou first, then Jiangcheng, and then many other provinces.

539
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Let's just take it as a free meal.

540
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,120
What are you looking at?

541
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,480
A beautiful woman's car is shining.

542
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
What are you talking about?

543
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I'm hungry.

544
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Let's eat when you're done.

545
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,880
Sit.

546
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
What's wrong, Your Highness?

547
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
I'm in the infirmary.

548
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,480
Where is the infirmary?

549
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Your Highness, this way.

550
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Sister Ruyi, what should we do?

551
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
I think I suddenly...

552
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
That one.

553
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,480
The person who serves you has never prepared anything for you.

554
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,480
This time, I came out in a hurry.

555
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,480
I think it's been a while.

556
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Can you help me find something useful?

557
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Please. They are all men.

558
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Thank you, Sister Ruyi.

559
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
Give me a horse.

560
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Sure.

561
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Your Highness, this way.

562
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,480
I'll go by myself. You don't have to serve me.

563
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Yes.

564
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Your Highness.

565
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

566
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Go get some water. I need to wash my hands.

567
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Please wait.

568
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Your Highness.

569
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Your Highness, what's wrong?

570
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm sorry.

571
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm sorry.

572
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
I'm sorry.

577
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
I'm not feeling well.

578
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
You can go ahead.

579
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Sir, I'll go check on her.

580
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Who is it?

581
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
It's me.

582
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Hello.

583
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Are you all right, Ying?

584
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Brother Yuanzhou,

585
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
I have a stomachache.

586
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Wait for me. I'll get Qianzhou.

587
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
No need.

588
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
I...

589
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
I'm not sick.

590
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Sister Ruyi went out to find something for me.

591
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
You can help me get the hot water from the other side.

592
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Brother Yuanzhou,

593
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
please help me taste it.

594
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
See if it's hot.

595
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
This hot water...

596
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
This hot water...

597
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Is it supposed to be this sweet?

598
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
It is.

599
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Here, drink some.

600
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
It's still hot.

601
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Put it on the table for a while.

602
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,480
I want to drink it after I wake up.

603
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
If you feel uncomfortable,

604
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
call us anytime.

605
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
Okay.

606
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
I'll go.

607
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
I...

608
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
You're awake.

609
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I'm addicted to the medicine.

610
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Not me.

611
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to wake up.

612
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
It's the princess.

613
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
It's an accident.

614
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,480
I didn't expect that she would be so bold.

615
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Qianzhou just blamed me.

616
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
She gave you the medicine.

617
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
She even added a soft gold to you.

618
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Maybe I scared her with my words that day.

619
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
She didn't want to.

620
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
She just wanted to run back to the capital

621
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,480
and ask the queen and the king about it.

622
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,480
She's really a busy old master.

623
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,480
She's really embarrassed now.

624
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Please help me call Yaorou and the others.

625
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,480
They're all confused now.

626
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm the only one who can move now.

627
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Thank you.

628
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
You're welcome.

629
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Do you want to know what kind of person I am?

630
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm not actually from Angu.

631
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,480
I was sold to Zhu Yiwei when I was very young.

632
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I'm not worth anything.

633
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,480
I just use the land to make a living.

634
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,480
I got the heart.

635
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
I grew up thinking that

636
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I wouldn't be so bad without a good family.

637
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,480
That's why I added a human heart.

638
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,480
It's not easy.

639
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,480
My benefactor said the same thing.

640
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,480
He's the old friend I asked you to investigate

641
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
who killed his murderer.

642
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,480
The queen of Angu.

643
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
The queen?

644
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Didn't you get punished because you killed her?

645
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Zhu Yiwei's life is like a day in the dark.

646
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,480
She's the one who treats me the best.

647
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,480
In my heart, she's like a mother.

648
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
How could I harm her?

649
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,480
I went to the Apothecary House that day

650
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,480
to save her.

651
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
You're a silly child.

652
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,480
You don't know anything except being an assassin.

653
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,480
There's something you must remember.

654
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Don't fall in love with a man in your life.

655
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,480
But you must have a child of your own.

656
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Go!

657
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Go!

658
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,480
She just told me

659
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
to leave Zhu Yiwei

660
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,480
and live a happy life.

661
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
She also said

662
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,480
not to fall in love with a man in your life.

663
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,480
But to have a child of your own.

664
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,480
So you changed to be a man.

665
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
I pretended to be dead

666
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
and escaped to Shengzhou.

667
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
I was in a house where my daughter's mother was killed.

668
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
A few years later,

669
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Zhu Yiwei went to Shengzhou to pick a white dog.

670
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
The people there didn't recognize me.

671
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
They caught me.

672
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
I wanted to take the opportunity to investigate

673
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
who killed her.

674
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I was so angry that I went back to Zhu Yiwei.

675
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,480
It's a good thing.

676
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
But don't worry.

677
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
As long as you call His Highness,

678
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,480
I'll do my best to help you investigate

679
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,480
who killed the Empress.

680
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Thank you.

681
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
But I will definitely fulfill

682
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Her Highness's wish.

683
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,480
So,

684
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,480
what about my child in the future?

685
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Good memory and good listening.

686
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Ren Xiaochuan's name is cute.

687
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,480
But don't you think it's a bit like my name?

688
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
And this is your business.

689
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
You don't have to tell me this.

690
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Although the child is mine,

691
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
you also have a name.

692
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
Just take it as a souvenir.

693
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,480
What do you mean I'm also a man?

694
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
No, did I just...

695
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,480
No, it was just a moment.

696
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,480
I won't force you to do something you don't like.

697
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Are you serious?

698
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Calm down.

699
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm not you.

700
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Don't worry. I'm very calm.

701
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
Actually, I've decided it's you.

702
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
You have good martial arts and a high head.

703
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,480
The child will not be like you or me in the future.

704
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
You don't have a family.

705
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Give me a child.

706
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
It won't hurt other women.

707
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
If you go to Angu,

708
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
if you die halfway,

709
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
I can leave you some incense.

710
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Such a beautiful thing.

711
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
How good.

712
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
What do you mean?

713
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,480
I wanted to seduce you little by little.

714
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
But I didn't expect you to be so kind.

715
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Since it's like this,

716
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,480
I'd rather not see you again.

717
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
No, calm down.

718
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Listen to me.

719
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
I won't give you a child.

720
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
I just want to be with the one I like.

721
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
I want to be with the one I like.

722
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,480
How dare you say that you don't love me at all?

723
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Don't lie.

724
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
The most popular thing in Baique

725
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,480
is to touch the heart of men.

726
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
I know

727
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,480
why you've been so gentle to me recently.

728
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
You're kind.

729
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,480
First, you deliberately neglected me.

730
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Then you find a chance to mention my past.

731
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Care about me, pity me.

732
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
In this way, I will be more careful to you.

733
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Lord Ning,

734
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,480
you're really thoughtful.

735
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
I...

736
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
And your body

737
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,480
is also warm.

738
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
What warm?

739
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
You're right, Ren Ruyi.

740
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I'm too thoughtful.

741
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
If you give me a child, you'll suffer.

742
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
How could it be?

743
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,480
It's good to have a child like you.

744
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Don't worry.

745
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
The mother lion on the grassland

746
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
has always been hunting and raising children by herself.

747
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
As long as the male lion cooperates,

748
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
as long as you cooperate well later,

749
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
as long as it succeeds,

750
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
I won't investigate you again.

751
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
I'm not a lion.

752
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
And let me tell you,

753
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
I'm a fool.

754
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
My family is gone.

755
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
The child thinks I'm not delicious at all.

756
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
The child is...

757
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
What a coincidence. I am too.

758
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Just accept it.

759
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,480
At most, I'm at home.

760
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
This...

761
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
After I'm at home,

762
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
I'll protect the princess.

763
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Is that okay?

764
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
I don't need it.

765
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Ren Ruyi.

766
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
You're robbing the man.

767
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
You shout.

768
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
You shout.

769
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Guards.

770
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Guards.

771
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Ren Ruyi is crazy.

772
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
They're all confused.

773
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
They can't help you.

774
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
It's no use if you don't shout.

775
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Listen to me.

776
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Calm down. Listen to me.

777
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
I'm poisoned.

778
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
I'm poisoned.

779
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I'm really...

780
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Listen to me.

781
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
How could Zhang Song let me take the princess and the gold

782
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
and leave the capital so easily?

783
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Before I left, he made me take the jade and the gold.

784
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I had to take the medicine from him every time.

785
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
Now is the seventh day I set out.

786
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
The most poisonous hand.

787
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
You can see it yourself.

788
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
See it yourself.

789
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
It's okay.

790
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,480
I have the poison of ten thousand poisons.

791
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
It can cure the poison of the world.

792
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,480
With him, I can't hurt the child.

793
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
But I'm not in a good mood right now.

794
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
Even if I succeed once,

795
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
the child may not be enough.

796
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
How about this?

797
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
I promise you.

798
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,480
But give me two more days.

799
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
When I take the first dose of the antidote,

800
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
I'll make sure you succeed.

801
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
I promise you.

802
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Heart-shaped butterfly.

803
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
I'll believe you when you use it.

804
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Okay.

805
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
I'll take it.

806
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Now, can you help me take the antidote?

807
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I'll take it.

808
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
The antidote is in the water.

809
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
There's not that much.

810
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
Come on.

811
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
Ren Ruoyi!

812
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Okay, I won't bother you now.

813
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,480
The mountain is closed, the sword is drawn.

814
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Between the rivers and lakes,

815
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,480
life and death are different.

816
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Who is the next one?

817
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,480
The king and the army are alone, there is no regret.

818
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,480
Once, the soldiers were with the moon,

819
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,480
high in the spring wind.

820
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,480
Once, the soldiers were with the moon, high in the spring wind.

821
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,480
High in the spring wind.

822
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,480
Who drinks a cup of snow, the blood turns into ashes.

823
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,480
Who sighs for a moment, the sky is scattered like water.

824
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
Looking back, the future is so beautiful.

825
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,480
The world is so beautiful.

826
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,480
Who will stay with me for the rest of my life?

827
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Who is the one who worries about the future?

828
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Who hopes that dreams will come true,

829
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,480
only for the coming of the wind and the coming of the wind.

830
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,480
Who is the one who cares about the future?

831
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,480
Who is the one who cares about the future?

832
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:35,480
Who is the one who cares about the future?

833
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:58,480
Who is the one who cares about the future?
