00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,360
Fire

8
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not like what the rumors say

9
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's just a man who grew up in the deep palace

10
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,180
He is a

11
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
I just saw that

12
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
The people of the delegation sent a body to the changing room

13
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
They were assigned to the garrison

14
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,180
The dead

15
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,180
Are the tiger and the tiger in the Wu delegation

16
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,180
Dead

17
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Did you see it clearly

18
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
I heard that

19
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,180
They died under the knife of the Han bandits who attacked last night

20
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
It's hard to have a nail that is more deep

21
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
It's so deep

22
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
The Han bandits who ate and bit the food

23
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
It wasn't his arrangement

24
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Who could it be

25
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
No, the appearance of the Han bandits

26
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
And the death of the tiger are all too strong

27
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Could it be

28
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
The bad people of Chu are provoking

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Or

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Was the delegation of the Wu delegation

31
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Who broke his identity

32
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
It's not like that

33
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,540
It's the delegation of the Wu delegation

34
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Who broke his identity

35
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
Killed him

36
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,540
And played a show for me

37
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,540
If it's true

38
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,540
Then the king's mind is too deep

39
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,540
Write these into a summary

40
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,540
And send it back to Jialin

41
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Yes

42
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,540
You must keep an eye on the king

43
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,540
And watch his every move

44
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,540
Yes

45
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Your honor

46
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
General Shantou invites King Li to visit the military camp

47
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,540
It seems that Shantou Chi

48
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,540
still wants to try again

49
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,540
How bold is king Li

50
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
How bold is King Li

51
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
How bold is King Li

52
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,540
We are the Han

53
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,540
We will never give up

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,540
We will never give up

55
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,540
We will never give up

56
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
We will never give up

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,540
We will never give up

58
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,540
We will never give up

59
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,540
We will not give up

60
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,540
Kill them all!

61
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,540
These are my private soldiers.

62
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,540
Your Highness, how do you feel?

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
It's not bad.

64
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,540
But I'm afraid you said something wrong.

65
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,540
These people...

66
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,540
should be soldiers of your country.

67
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Not your private soldiers.

68
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,540
You're so eloquent.

69
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,540
You're too kind.

70
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,540
I have a few horses.

71
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Would you like to watch?

72
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Bring the horses up!

73
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,540
Yes!

74
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Not bad.

75
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
Not bad.

76
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,540
I've heard that the soldiers of the Eastern Regions are very kind.

77
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,540
I'm so honored to meet you today.

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,540
I wonder if I'm lucky enough to invite you to come here.

79
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,540
I'd rather obey your order.

80
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Your Highness.

81
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
Please.

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Please.

83
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,540
Please.

84
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,540
Today, I'll take you to visit the city.

85
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,540
Protect His Highness and follow them.

86
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,540
Yes.

87
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
Let's go.

88
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,540
Move!

89
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,540
This is too fast.

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Something's wrong.

91
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,540
Protect His Highness!

92
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,540
Go!

93
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
Move!

94
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
Move!

95
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Move!

96
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
Move!

97
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
Move!

98
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,540
It's General Shen.

99
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
Be careful!

100
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,540
Why are you so slow?

101
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
You're like a woman.

102
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Hurry up!

103
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Go!

104
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,540
Go!

105
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Move!

106
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Hurry up!

107
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Qian, we can't keep chasing them.

108
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,540
You go to the inner road.

109
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Okay.

110
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Follow me.

111
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Yes.

112
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Go!

113
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Move!

114
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
Move!

115
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,540
Move!

116
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Are you okay?

117
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Your Highness.

119
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Is the city under my control more prosperous than before?

120
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
More prosperous?

121
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Your country's leader is fighting for the most important tax.

122
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,540
People have to work harder to eat.

123
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,540
General Shen Tu, why do you have to do this?

124
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,540
This is my compensation.

126
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
I don't want your money.

127
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,540
If it weren't for your Yang family's incompetence,

128
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,540
we wouldn't have to pay such a heavy tax.

129
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Do you know?

130
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,540
He is the brother of that bastard.

131
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
He's wearing the gold of the Wu family.

132
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,540
It's all our blood and money.

133
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Blood and money!

134
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,540
Blood and money!

135
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Blood and money!

136
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,540
Blood and money!

137
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,540
General Shen!

138
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
General Shen!

139
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,540
Somebody!

140
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,540
Move!

141
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
Move!

142
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540
Move!

143
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Move!

144
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540
What's going on?

145
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,540
Blood and money!

146
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
Somebody!

147
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Give us our money!

148
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,540
Give us our money!

149
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
Sir.

150
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Wait a minute.

151
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
Let this guy eat more bones.

152
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,540
Who let him be so sharp?

153
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Somebody!

154
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
Somebody!

155
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
Bad people!

156
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
All the people from the palace are bad people.

157
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
I'll beat you to death!

158
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
You!

159
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
I'll beat you to death!

160
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,540
You!

161
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Are you hurt?

162
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,540
Yes.

163
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
General.

164
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,540
How dare you!

165
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,540
How dare you!

166
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,540
How dare you provoke the people to attack the King of Li!

167
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Let's go after them!

168
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
General Shen Tu.

169
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Do you think these people were just caught by the evil people?

170
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:58,540
That's why they were so arrogant when King of Li was attacked?

171
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Who are you?

172
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
Why haven't I seen you in the delegation today?

173
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
There are the Imperial Guards of the State of An.

174
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,540
There are also the six Daoist Churches in the State of Wu.

175
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Don't you think that King of Li is the ambassador of the state?

176
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,540
He doesn't have the security guards to protect him?

177
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,540
Move!

178
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,540
Move!

179
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,540
Although they didn't run fast enough,

180
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,540
they killed two people in the dark night

181
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,540
to destroy the peace talks between the two countries.

182
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
There's no problem.

183
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,540
The six Daoist Churches are indeed very smart.

184
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
Your Highness.

185
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,540
I'm deeply hurt.

186
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
I can't send you back.

187
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
Let's go!

188
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,540
Sister Ru Yi.

189
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

190
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
How did you guard the place?

191
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
You were in danger!

192
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,540
It's not Brother Qian's fault. I was too careless.

193
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,540
By the way, don't go to those people's trouble.

194
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
They were supposed to live peacefully,

195
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
but they became the people of Keshui.

196
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
Your Highness.

197
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,540
I don't blame the people.

198
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,540
But the guard of the previous government was wrong.

199
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
It was a serious mistake.

200
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Lord Ning.

202
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
You must have an explanation for this.

203
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Don't worry.

204
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Yuan Lu.

205
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
Did you take the people sent by the master of the dark night away?

206
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,540
We have our own people in the yard.

207
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Xiao Manyang?

208
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,540
Maybe not far.

209
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
I was wrong to command the army.

210
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
I didn't predict the situation in advance.

211
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,540
So I, Ning Yuanzhou, will give you a real punishment.

212
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Boss!

213
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,940
No! Ning Yuanzhou, I order you!

214
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,540
He is the head of the guards. Don't interfere with his decision.

215
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,540
You dare to wanna work for the army?

216
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Get away!

217
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Next time you stop him, take my word as a再次庆啊!

218
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
insinuate!

219
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Boss!

220
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
If you box legends louder then all the An workers at the country can hear it.

221
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,480
Master Don, what are you doing?

222
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Everyone is wrong, we should fight together

223
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Yes, we should fight together

224
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
My lord, this is an order

225
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Yuan Luo

226
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,480
You can't fight, I will do it

227
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Why do you come?

228
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
I am the one who saved your highness today

229
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Yuan Luo

230
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
You are a soldier

231
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
You don't understand this

232
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
No wonder you can't protect people

233
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Do you think he is willing to fight?

234
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
No, he just wants to blame himself

235
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
To warn you

236
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
You are in the land of An

237
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
There is no such a good life

238
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
As long as you go through Tianxing xia

239
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
You can have a good life

240
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
In the future, there are enemies around you

241
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
There are traps everywhere

242
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,480
If you make a mistake, you will be punished

243
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Yes, I want to say what he said

244
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Fight

245
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
I will kill you

246
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,480
These whip, he did it for you

247
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Do you remember?

248
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
He was destroyed by an enemy

249
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
It's a great proof

250
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
He knows they deny this

251
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I think he who dyed the whip

252
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Would be θ0

253
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Yuan Luo

254
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
You told us that you had found a good target

255
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Now you are culpable

256
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,200
I need this

257
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,480
You don't understand

258
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I asked for help

259
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
You can't do this

260
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480

I'm sorry.

268
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480

270
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480

I'm sorry.

274
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
I'm sorry.

283

I'm sorry.

287
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Your highness.

293
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Apply Golden Glory should be the bedyear.

294
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,480
God of Burning.

295
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
What is this?

296
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,920
It's4 ruin DAVID.

297
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,680
Old man,

298
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

299
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,560
Brother Liancheng!

300
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,720
Tao'er!

301
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,560
Brother Liancheng!

302
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,840
Liao Ning! Tao'er!

303
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,800
D tremendous amount of blood

304
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,160
Nian lucky just погway

305
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
He plays instead begin to worry

306
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,200
I told just you

307
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,900
Last night he not only internal damage

308
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,680
But also a Have recovered

309
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,520
Old injuries plus heart damage

310
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
And blood in the end

311
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,560
There will be no life

312
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,720
I'll go Simon

313
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,560
Two?

314
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,360
Where is your child?

315
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,520
Wait.

316
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,480
I won't apologize for what happened yesterday.

317
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,800
You saved His Highness.

318
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
So...

319
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,000
You can kill me or hang me, up to you.

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,880
You dare to do that?

321
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,720
And me.

322
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,480
Sorry. I shouldn't have scolded you like that.

323
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,160
You're right.

324
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,640
When my father passed away, you were only a few years old.

325
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
When my father died, you were only a few years old

326
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,040
I shouldn't have put the grudge against Zhu Yiwei

327
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,040
on you

328
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
I never let anyone down

329
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,880
But I was so stupid yesterday

330
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,760
I owe you my life like God

331
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,160
I'll give you any medicine you want

332
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,480
No need

333
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,720
Forget it

334
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,920
Take the medicine

335
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
Take care of it

336
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,480
But

337
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,880
You two don't know women

338
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,760
She won't forgive us so easily

339
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
But she won't leave if she comes back

340
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,600
Why do you say that?

341
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,320
First, her identity was exposed

342
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,920
Second, she knows we hate her

343
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,320
Third, she was so badly injured

344
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,960
But she still came back

345
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,640
Who do you think it's for?

346
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,360
It's better to let Ning take off his clothes

347
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,040
So cool

348
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,760
You're awake

349
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,400
Why is it so familiar?

350
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
But luckily

351
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,920
I didn't get any anesthetic this time

352
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,160
It's in here

353
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
It's so delicious

354
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,200
Why are you back?

355
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,680
Because of you

356
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,000
Because I don't believe your promise

357
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,560
You six

358
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,600
You lied to me and killed me

359
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,720
You're so cunning

360
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,280
Finding the murderer who killed her

361
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,680
is my life's destiny

362
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,080
You just want to punish me with a few lines

363
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,560
No way

364
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,040
My deal with you hasn't ended yet

365
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,280
You're right

366
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,800
It's a big deal

367
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,080
You must keep an eye on me

368
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,800
Sit down

369
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,240
Do you need me?

370
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,520
I will stay the best snap

371
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,080
Like this

372
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,280
But in the end

373
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,540
they shot me

374
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,460
two times

375
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,400
I still could do nothing

376
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
I should not leave you

377
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,400
Because if I don't have to take off my clothes

378
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
It's won't be the mutual friendship

379
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:06,920
Finally

380
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
Okay.

381
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Why do you agree to everything?

382
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
If I tell you that I want to give birth to a child with you, you also agree?

383
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Okay.

384
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Okay.

385
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,480
I mean, we are all in a bad shape now.

386
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
And I'm poisoned now.

387
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
If now...

388
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,480
If now, it's not good for the child.

389
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
How about this?

390
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
After everything is over, we'll talk.

391
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
You want to make up for it again?

392
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
No matter how much I'm angry, I'll just be good.

393
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Just be good.

394
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
You're really not confused by me.

395
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,480
The way you made it just now was very good.

396
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
I knew it when you made the first whip.

397
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,480
It looks like a fresh blood, but it's just a flesh wound.

398
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
It's not hurt.

399
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
If it's not because of your face, it looks good.

400
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,480
I'll give you a gift while you're gone.

401
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Okay.

402
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Again.

403
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,480
I mean, what you said just now was very good.

404
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Very accurate.

405
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
It's exactly what I thought.

406
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Of course.

407
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
I've been a master of the lower and upper class.

408
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I know how you feel when you stand in your position.

409
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,480
So you understand me.

410
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
What you said just now is true.

411
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,480
It means you're really willing to do it after everything is over.

412
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
I'm willing.

413
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Then you have to prove it to me.

414
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
How to prove it?

415
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
You missed this the most.

416
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,480
If we keep playing game calls, you will see me will leave you do nothing.

417
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
I know you will.

418
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,480
If you thought you could escape quickly, you were wrong.

419
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I was wrong.

420
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Don't you say I'm just a piece of cake?

421
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,480
In the future, slowly, slowly,

422
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
one move at a time,

423
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
keep it.

424
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Okay.

425
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Your Highness.

426
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Yuan Lu.

427
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Morning.

428
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Your Highness, you can't go in.

429
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Why not?

430
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Ning Tong hasn't woken up yet.

431
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
You can't go in.

432
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
It's not convenient.

433
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
It's okay.

434
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
I'll go in and have a look.

435
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
Otherwise, I'm really worried.

436
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
You won't let me guard you.

437
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Your Highness.

438
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
What's wrong?

439
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Listen to me.

440
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Go in.

441
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
How about this?

442
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
You go back first.

443
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
When Ning Tong wakes up, I'll go and call you.

444
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Don't worry.

445
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
I'll go in and have a look.

446
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Don't you believe me?

447
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
I'll go and call you.

448
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
I'll go and call you.

449
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
It's too bad.

450
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
He's awake.

451
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Your Highness.

452
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
You can't go in even if you're awake.

453
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Why?

454
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Because...

455
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Because Brother Qian is inside

456
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
and is giving Ning Tong acupuncture.

457
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Acupuncture can't be seen.

458
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Ning Tong was awakened by acupuncture.

459
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Awakened?

460
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
That's right.

461
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
No.

462
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
When I just came here,

463
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Brother Qian was making medicine outside.

464
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,480
Brother 13 just changed his shift with Brother Qian.

465
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Acupuncture needs to be removed.

466
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Okay.

467
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
I'll go to the front yard first.

468
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
I'll come back later.

469
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
No.

470
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
I just went to see Sister Ru Yi.

471
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
She's not in the room.

472
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
You lied to me.

473
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
In the room, it's not Brother Qian.

474
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
It's Ru Yi.

475
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Everyone is pretending not to know.

476
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Brother Yuan Zhou and Sister Ru Yi,

477
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
it's true.

478
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
It's true.

479
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
That's great.

480
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
I've been wrong for a long time.

481
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
I've been wrong for a long time.

482
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
They should be the couple

483
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
in the script.

484
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Your Highness.

485
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Are you okay?

486
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm fine.

487
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Just now,

488
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
we saw a little rabbit.

489
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
It was furry and cute.

490
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
It was so cute.

491
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
It was so cute.

492
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
It was so cute.

493
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
It was so cute.

494
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
It was so cute.

495
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
It was so cute.

496
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
There's a rabbit here.

497
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Take me there.

498
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
There.

499
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
There.

500
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Hurry up.

501
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Go.

502
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
It's so cute.

503
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
What's wrong?

504
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
It was much better yesterday.

505
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Suddenly, there was a mess in the field.

506
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
You're still not stable today.

507
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Wait for me to clean up.

508
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
I'll help you deal with it later.

509
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Why not now?

510
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Shi San and others will come to me later.

511
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
They saw you here.

512
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
They will misunderstand that last night we...

513
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Misunderstand?

514
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Who doesn't know about us?

515
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
They were playing chess before.

516
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
They were playing in front of me.

517
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Ying doesn't know.

518
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Ying is still young.

519
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
She doesn't know these things.

520
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
How can she not know these things?

521
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
You don't know that she and Zheng Qing Yun...

522
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
are related.

523
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Do you recognize me?

524
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
This body?

525
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Ning�� Ch湖...

526
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Are you embarrassed?

527
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
I'm not embarrassed.

528
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
I...

529
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Before that...

530
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I won't touch a single finger of yours.

531
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,480
I'm very patient when it comes to killing.

532
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Old Ning, are you done?

533
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
God is coming to deliver the medicine.

534
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Lord Du is also coming to ask about your arrangement today.

535
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Yuan Lu asked me to come and report to you.

536
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Old Ning.

537
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Old Ning.

538
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
I'm leaving.

539
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Just leave! Why are you kicking me?

540
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
You're angry! You're angry!

541
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
You can't play anymore, right?

542
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Now that the storm has calmed down,

543
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
we'll go to the capital to bid farewell to Chen Duchi.

544
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
We'll go to the country of An immediately.

545
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,480
However, from today onwards,

546
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
for the sake of your safety,

547
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,480
the delegation and the business team will be united.

548
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Then, the king is safe.

549
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
What about saving His Majesty?

550
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
The reason why we established the business team

551
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
is to make it easier to act.

552
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
But yesterday, someone said

553
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
that the king is leaving.

554
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I was reminded of that.

555
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Since the king is leaving,

556
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
the people of the Six Halls will surely follow him.

557
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Otherwise, they will make the people of An doubt.

558
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
So my previous decision

559
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
was indeed a trap.

560
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Think about it.

561
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
If you are from An,

562
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
what would you think?

563
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
How would you guess the delegation's actions?

564
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
First, the king is leaving.

565
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,480
The people of the Six Halls will surely participate.

566
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Secondly, I believe that the people of An can also think that

567
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
after we arrive at the capital,

568
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
we will surely think of all ways to save His Majesty.

569
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
If that's the case,

570
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,480
we might as well tell them directly

571
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,480
that we have a lot of people, but they are all very incompetent.

572
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,480
This way, they can relax and be alert.

573
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
I think it makes sense.

574
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,480
After all, the matter of Ning Tou re-establishing the Six Halls is a secret order.

575
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
The people of An don't know about it.

576
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
The people of the Five Poison Division have all disappeared.

577
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
So they might not be able to find out our background.

578
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Everyone, look at our beautiful face.

579
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
The new king, Li,

580
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,480
the new minister Du,

581
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
the one who committed a grave crime and was sent to the army, Ning Tou,

582
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
the one who was sent to the prison, me,

583
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
and the little kid, Yuan Lu.

584
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Look at these two guys.

585
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
One is a blind man and the other is a fool.

586
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
You're the one who's a blind man.

587
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Smile.

588
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Do you think that's necessary?

589
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
The incompetent ones are all written on your face.

590
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
You're all so bad.

591
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Don't be rude to me and Minister Du.

592
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Then, let's do this.

593
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Let them see how bad we are.

594
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
After we arrive at An,

595
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
what kind of hell will happen?

596
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Look.

597
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Look, Ru Yi Jing.

598
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Everyone is happy that you're back.

599
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Ning Tou and I are the happiest.

600
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Thank you for earlier.

601
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
I'm also happy.

602
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
That's good.

603
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Let's go.

604
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Stop!

605
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
You're not allowed to follow the car.

606
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Move aside!

607
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
It seems that it's a car.

608
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Sister Ru Yi, I want to ask you something.

609
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Miss Ru Yi,

610
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm sorry.

611
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
I'm sorry.

612
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
I'm sorry.

613
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I want to ask you something.

614
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Miss Ru Yi.

615
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
I heard that you're not stable.

616
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
Do you need me to check it for you?

617
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Of course I do.

618
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
I have to be faster.

619
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Otherwise, what if I get into An?

620
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
I want to ride a horse.

621
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Commander Ning, you and Gu can ride a horse.

622
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Okay.

623
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Stop the car.

624
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Yan Ruo.

625
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Brother 13.

626
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Old Qian.

627
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Why is 13 so weird today?

628
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Why is he so mean to me?

629
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Maybe because you hugged a female rabbit.

630
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
You old bastard.

631
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
I'll go away.

632
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Are you sick?

633
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Come.

634
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
What are you laughing at?

635
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
No, you should be serious.

636
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Water is coming.

637
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Water is coming.

638
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Sit down.

639
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I want it too.

640
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
I want it too.

641
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
I want it too.

642
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Here.

643
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Okay.

644
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Don't drink it.

645
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
There's something wrong with the water.

646
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Everyone, stop drinking.

647
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
There's a dead rat in the water.

648
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Stop drinking.

649
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Go.

650
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
I'll beat you to death.

651
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Who is it?

652
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Here, youkai.

653
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Stop chasing.

654
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
This kid is still wearing a school uniform.

655
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Are you okay?

656
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Why did they do this to me?

657
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,480
They poisoned me in the well and smashed me with stones.

658
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Is it because I'm Li Wan and I was born with sin?

659
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
They didn't do this to you.

660
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
They did it to your brother.

661
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
But my brother didn't do it on purpose.

662
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
A failure is a common thing in the army.

663
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
He's suffering in the country now.

664
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Your Highness.

665
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
Look at that kid.

666
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
How old is he?

667
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
He's about 14 or 15 years old.

668
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Your Highness.

669
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
According to the rules of the court,

670
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
men should be in the age of 18.

671
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
His Majesty sent troops to Zhao and Zhao.

672
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
He ordered 50% of the border.

673
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
As long as men over 16 years old are sent to the army.

674
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
He's wearing a horse suit.

675
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
He's probably laughing at his father.

676
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
The battle at Tianmen Pass.

677
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,480
There are thousands of people who are injured in the battle.

678
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
He has those people yesterday.

679
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
He's worried that once His Majesty returns to the court,

680
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
he will immediately start a war.

681
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
That's why he's going to sell his army to you.

682
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,480
But men are sent to the army.

683
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Women are really aware.

684
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Isn't it the duty of the people?

685
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Living and working in peace.

686
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
Being healthy and living a good life.

687
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
That's the duty of the people.

688
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
At the time of His Majesty,

689
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
the people of Xu City

690
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
didn't get any special benefits.

691
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Now the Wu State is defeated.

692
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Their hearts are even cooler.

693
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Water can be in the boat, you can be in the boat.

694
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Before you want others to be loyal to you,

695
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
you have to think about

696
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
what you have done for them.

697
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Will you still accompany me to the State of An?

698
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Brother Wang made you go to jail.

699
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I was so mischievous before.

700
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Did I hurt everyone's hearts?

701
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
I didn't seem to have done anything for everyone before.

702
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
First of all,

703
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
don't forget that I am your brother.

704
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Moreover,

705
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
we all took the court's salary.

706
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,480
It's the so-called road of the ten kings and the ten kings.

707
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
So we will definitely accompany you.

708
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Yes, Your Highness.

709
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
I drank the wine you treated me to a few days ago.

710
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
We owe you a favor.

711
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Yes, Your Highness.

712
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
You also treated us to roast lamb.

713
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,480
We have to go to the State of An to get some lamb.

714
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Yes, Your Highness.

715
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
When I was in the Sky Tower,

716
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
you saved my life.

717
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
I made a deal with him.

718
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
I have to send you to the capital of An

719
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
so that he can pay you back.

720
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
We will accompany you.

721
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Yes.

722
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Yes.

723
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Yes.

724
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
Yes.

725
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Yes.

726
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Yes.

727
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Yes.

728
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Yes.

729
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Yes.

730
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Yes.

731
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Thank you, everyone.

732
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,480
When I get back to my brother,

733
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I will make sure that he treats everyone well.

734
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
He treats the people well.

735
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Only then can he make everyone's heart hurt.

736
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Then he can make up for it.

737
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Let everyone in the future,

738
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
no,

739
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
in the next life,

740
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
in the next life,

741
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
still want to be a Chinese.

742
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Okay.

743
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Yes.

744
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

745
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

746
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
That is the one who defeated the war.

747
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
The King of Wu.

748
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
Let's go.

749
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
I have been thinking about it.

750
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,480
I think there must be something wrong with the world.

751
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,480
I'm afraid that these people have ruined the name of the county chief.

752
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
So I brought these people to the Prime Minister's mansion

753
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
to be dealt with by the Prime Minister.

754
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
How dare you, a thief,

755
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
dare to harm my son-in-law?

756
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Come on,

757
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
take them away first.

758
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Yes.

759
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
Let's go.

760
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Hurry up.

761
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
I know that I have little money.

762
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,480
I'm afraid that I will be ungrateful and I will be late for the county chief.

763
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Please accept these gifts.

764
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
From today on,

765
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,480
I will clean the courtyard and wait for your order.

766
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I will wait for the county chief to come to the court.

767
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Look at you.

768
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
From now on, we are a family.

769
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Why are you so polite?

770
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
I'm not polite.

771
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Don't be polite.

772
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
I don't care about him.

773
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
I have an emergency.

774
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
I must see my father tonight.

775
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,480
I'll leave first.

776
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
Okay.

777
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
Come on,

778
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
send Chang Qing Hou off for me.

779
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
And,

780
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,480
sign the new big circle for Chang Qing Hou.

781
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Thank you, father-in-law.

782
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Who told you to scream?

783
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Father,

784
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
I'm here to see you

785
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
to ask you to find His Majesty

786
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
and cancel this marriage.

787
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
But you

788
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
are here to make it clear to me.

789
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,480
I don't care.

790
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I don't want to marry him.

791
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
I won't marry him no matter what.

792
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,480
If you don't want to marry him,

793
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,480
just send someone to hurt him.

794
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,480
Do you think you are smart?

795
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
You are just showing off your skills.

796
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
You are just showing off your skills.

797
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
You are just showing off your skills.

798
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
You are just showing off your skills.

799
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,480
You brought him to the mansion as soon as you came to the capital.

800
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,480
How can you make me look so shameless?

801
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,480
If I say that

802
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
I sent someone to teach him a lesson,

803
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
you don't know who he is.

804
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
Do you believe it?

805
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Yue.

806
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
I'm not lying.

807
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
He had a fight with me at the race.

808
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
If you don't believe it, you can ask him.

809
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,480
At that time,

810
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
I thought he was just a normal boy in the Sand Department.

811
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Who knows?

812
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,480
Anyway,

813
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
I can't marry him.

814
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
You don't marry him, you just defy the decree.

815
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Don't you know what a big crime this is?

816
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
I'm a county magistrate.

817
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
Why should I be wronged?

818
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,480
Why should I marry a son of a magistrate?

819
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,480
Dad.

820
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Can't you...

821
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,480
Can't you think of another way?

822
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
The Ministry of War has given the decree.

823
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,480
There is no change.

824
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,480
But today,

825
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,480
he brought the banquet he set up as a gift.

826
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,480
He brought the man who hurt him

827
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,480
to this seat.

828
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,480
5 points of merit,

829
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,480
3 points of merit,

830
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
and 2 points of power.

831
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
At a young age,

832
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,480
there is such a hand and a city.

833
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,480
You marry him,

834
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,480
it's not a bad thing for our Sand Department.

835
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,480
Okay.

836
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,480
I'm leaving.

837
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Hey, wait.

838
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,480
Wait.

839
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,480
What do you want?

840
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,480
I'm sorry.

841
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,480
I shouldn't have asked someone to deal with you that day.

842
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
But...

843
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Stop.

844
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
You apologized to me,

845
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
but you didn't show any sincerity.

846
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
Why don't you say it?

847
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,480
Li Tonggong.

848
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
I sincerely apologize to you.

849
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
Don't be so hard on me.

850
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480
If I have to be hard on you,

851
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
why can you be so hard on me?

852
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,480
You don't drink, you drink.

853
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,480
Okay.

854
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I'll tell you.

855
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Within a month,

856
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,480
whether you break your leg

857
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,480
or have a fight with another woman,

858
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,480
you must make our marriage a mess.

859
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,480
Otherwise,

860
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,480
even if I marry you,

861
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
I will always make you unhappy.

862
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,480
I want you to be the biggest laughing stock of Quan Da'an.

863
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
Whatever.

864
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,480
Anyway, I'm a son of a man.

865
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,480
I've been a laughing stock since I was born.

866
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,480
Lady Jinmin, please remember.

867
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,480
Our marriage is the will of the Emperor.

868
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,480
No matter how much you don't want to marry me,

869
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,480
how much you look down on me,

870
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,480
I will be your husband in the future.

871
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,480
My honor is your honor.

872
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
Do you hear me?

873
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
Don't even think about it.

874
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
If they want to eat duck meat,

875
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
I will not marry you even if I die.

876
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,480
Then you go to die.

877
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,480
How do you want to die?

878
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,480
The moon is cold and the moon is bright.

879
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,480
The spring breeze is drunk.

880
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,480
The summer is cold and the winter is cold.

881
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,480
The spring breeze is drunk.

882
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:58,480
The love song is sweet and the spring breeze is sad.

883
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,480
Who drinks the snow and the snow falls.

884
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,480
Who wants to be separated for a lifetime.

885
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,480
The sky is scattered like water.

886
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,480
Looking back at the past is so delicious.

887
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,480
The world is cold and the wine is cold.

888
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,480
Who will stay for the rest of his life?

889
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:31,480
Who is drunk and worried about the heartless.

890
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,480
Who hopes to have a dream,

891
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,480
only for the wind and the wind.

892
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,480
The world is cold and the snow falls.

893
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,480
How many years have passed?

894
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:55,480
The life is endless.

895
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,480
The wind and the snow fall.

896
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,480
Who hopes to have a dream,

897
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,480
only for the wind and the wind.

898
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,480
The world is cold and the snow falls.

899
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,480
Who hopes to have a dream,

900
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,480
only for the wind and the snow falls.
