00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,120
the

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
the

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
the

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,120
the

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,120
the

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,120
the

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,120
the

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,120
the

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
the

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,240
the

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,240
the

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,640
the

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:51,400
the

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
the

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,380
現在我們 bought your run

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:53,860
Jesse

18
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,760
vity

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Yes, I don't care.

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I take care of those little cats and dogs every day.

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
I'm so busy.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Brother who has no poison,

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
you'd better come back and take care of them.

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Only a little bit.

25
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Everyone risked their lives

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
to steal these ashes.

27
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Not for the money.

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
For the love of the Mermaid Guard,

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
the World Guards, and Zhang Mu.

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Thank you.

31
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
My Lord,

32
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
we'd better go to do something early.

33
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
And make our way safe.

34
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
He knew it so soon.

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Princess Li Cheng said

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
that the friendship between Yin Ni and Master Ren

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
would make a good leader

38
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
even if he couldn't find the bones.

39
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
She also said

40
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
if you have a little conscience,

41
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
you must help her

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
to make a good name

43
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
and worship Master Ren.

44
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
She knew that I was a good person.

45
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
She knew that I was a good person.

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
She knew that I was a good person.

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
She knew that I was a good person.

48
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
She knew that I was a good person.

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
She knew that I was a good person.

50
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Let them stop.

51
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I'll find a way to see Master Ren.

52
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
You can get him out

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
when you get out of the palace.

54
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Wait for a few hundred bowls.

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Then seal the entrance.

56
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Do we really have to seal it all?

57
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Whether I'm a good person or not,

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
I don't allow anyone

59
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
to disturb her peace

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
before I come.

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Even if I'd rather see her

62
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
in the middle of the night,

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
it's impossible.

64
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Let's go.

65
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
When will Zhen Yi come back?

66
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Your Majesty,

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
His Majesty called back His Highness's edict

68
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
and it was only passed out a few days ago.

69
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
I believe His Highness will receive it

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
in a few days.

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,760
You will see His Highness soon.

72
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Very good.

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Very good.

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Come.

75
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,760
I was strict with you before.

76
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
But that was for your own good.

77
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I hope you can help me in the future.

78
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Help Second Brother

79
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,760
to build up the country of Great An.

80
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
The reason why I gave you the edict

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,760
is because you also mean that.

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Your Majesty,

83
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I'll send you here.

84
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Take it.

85
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
I know you've been in trouble recently

86
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
and need money.

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

88
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
By the way,

89
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
His Majesty has decided

90
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
to let Princess Li Cheng be the Crown Princess.

91
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
You don't have to tell me that.

92
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I'm treating you well

93
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
not to get information from you.

94
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
But I can't just leave without knowing.

95
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
I'll go.

96
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
What do you want?

97
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Can't I find you when I'm free?

98
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm an orphan now.

99
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
It's easier to act now.

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,760
If you become the Prime Minister,

101
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,760
you'll have more reasons to see me.

102
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
It's inconvenient in the palace.

103
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
I've been in the palace for so long.

104
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Can't you see me?

105
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
You have time to go horse riding with Chu Yue.

106
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Don't you have time to visit me in the temple?

107
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
If I remember correctly,

108
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
you arranged this marriage

109
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
for me personally.

110
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Didn't you?

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
You said these things

112
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
on purpose, didn't you?

113
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
I told you that

114
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
our cooperation is the cooperation between me and Sha Xi.

115
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
But now,

116
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,760
this person has become Chu Yue from you.

117
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Do you love Yue?

118
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
You asked me to come here

119
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
just to ask these boring questions?

120
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
These questions

121
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
may be boring to you,

122
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
but they're important to me.

123
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Answer me.

124
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Or I won't help you anymore.

125
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
No.

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
She doesn't love me either.

127
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Are you satisfied?

128
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Do you love me?

129
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
You don't know?

130
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
I don't know.

131
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Once you ask me some questions,

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
you're destined to get the answer you want.

133
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,760
So you've been using my feelings for you

134
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
to catch me

135
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
and let me help you,

136
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
right?

137
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
At the beginning,

138
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
didn't you want to know about the late queen

139
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
and approach me on purpose?

140
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,760
Why do you have to say such a bad thing?

141
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Don't go.

142
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I don't want to force you to do anything.

143
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
If you hate me,

144
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
we'll never see each other again.

145
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Tong Guang.

146
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
For so long,

147
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
have you ever

148
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
loved me

149
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
even a little bit?

150
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Very good.

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Since you're unkind,

152
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
don't blame me for being unkind.

153
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Get out of the palace now

154
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
and listen to that woman's words.

155
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Who?

156
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Who else?

157
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
The princess Li Cheng

158
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
you saved from the fire

159
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
without any effort.

160
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
What did you do?

161
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
A woman who wanted to take my place

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
and take yours.

163
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
What do you think I would do to her?

164
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
If anything happens to her,

165
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
I'll definitely

166
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
make you pay for it.

167
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Protect the princess!

168
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Protect the princess!

169
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Hold on!

170
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
We must protect the princess!

171
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
See if there are any who pretend to be dead.

172
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Don't let any of them go!

173
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Search!

174
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Find the princess!

175
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Yes!

176
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Search!

177
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Search!

178
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Watch out!

179
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Watch out!

180
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Watch out!

181
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Yuan Zhou

182
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Yuan Zhou

183
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Yuan Zhou

184
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Lin Mian

185
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Lin Mian

186
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
You're alive.

187
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Is it you?

188
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Is it really you?

189
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Lu Yi Qian, you're really alive.

190
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Why did you lie to me?

191
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Why did you come to me so soon?

192
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
I was worried about you every day

193
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
and almost cried my eyes out.

194
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Where's my brother?

195
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Where's my brother? Is he safe?

196
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Don't worry.

197
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Your brother is fine now.

198
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Liu Daotang received the news

199
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
that he has passed Gui De Garden

200
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
and is heading to He County.

201
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
And a while ago

202
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
I had already sent An Li and the others

203
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
to rebuild the An Gui Pavilion.

204
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
With their help,

205
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
it will definitely go smoothly.

206
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
That's great.

207
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Lu Yi,

208
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
what exactly have you been through?

209
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Gui De Garden

210
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Gui De Garden

211
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Do you really have the heart

212
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
to let Li Tenguang know

213
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
that you're still alive?

214
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
My heart is already

215
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
in your hands.

216
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
What's in front of you now

217
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
is Ren Ruyi.

218
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
You're so ruthless

219
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
and heartless.

220
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
We're both heartless.

221
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Your stabbing me

222
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
doesn't count as money.

223
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
According to the book,

224
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
the left is the heart of the people,

225
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
and the heart is different from the ordinary people.

226
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
The right hand is in the chest,

227
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
and not the left.

228
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
So when Cheng Tian was attacked

229
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
in the fifth year of spring,

230
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
he was able to see through the chest,

231
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
but he didn't die.

232
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
You let me stab your left chest.

233
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
You did it on purpose.

234
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
But I won the bet.

235
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
The bet is that you still have

236
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
a sense of righteousness and dignity.

237
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
You helped me.

238
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
You didn't let Andy

239
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
know about my death.

240
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
And I'm lucky.

241
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Zi He survived.

242
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
I don't know

243
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
why I helped you.

244
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Maybe it's because

245
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
of what you've done all this time.

246
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
You're like a hero.

247
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Let's meet by ourselves.

248
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Take the medicine.

249
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
So that's how it is.

250
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
This Deng Hui is a gentleman.

251
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
I was badly hurt this morning.

252
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I was thinking

253
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
I'd come to you when I was free.

254
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
But I didn't expect to hear

255
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
the signal of the Sha Xi tribe

256
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
calling the people to attack at night.

257
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I thought it was a horse farm nearby.

258
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
So I couldn't help but come to see.

259
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
My people have been watching Li Gong.

260
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
I heard that Li Tenguang's men

261
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
brought you out.

262
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
So I rushed the guest over.

263
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
But it was too late.

264
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Yang, Yuan Zhou didn't protect you.

265
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
What are you talking about?

266
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
You escaped from death.

267
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
You rushed back to Andu

268
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,760
for me day and night.

269
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
I was so touched.

270
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
How could I blame you?

271
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
And I know

272
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
you never leave me alone.

273
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Let's go.

274
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Okay.

275
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
My people are waiting outside.

276
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Ruyi, you have to work harder.

277
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
We'll rush to the guesthouse

278
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
and drive three hours.

279
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Then we can get rid of

280
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
An Jun's pursuit.

281
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Okay.

282
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Let's go.

283
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
I'm not going.

284
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
I want to go back to Li Gong.

285
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Back to Li Gong?

286
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Why?

287
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
You've probably already known

288
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
the order from Andi.

289
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Whether to marry the second prince

290
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
or to marry him,

291
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
I'll be the future

292
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
of this country.

293
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Ruyi, Yuan Zhou,

294
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I don't want to go back.

295
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
You've turned the little sparrow

296
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
in the jade cage

297
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
into a eagle.

298
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
I can't go back.

299
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Ying, you can't be impulsive.

300
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
It's not a child's play.

301
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
The political situation in the country is complicated.

302
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Andi is ruthless.

303
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
You'll be dead if you stay.

304
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
And the one who just came to kill you

305
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
is probably the one sent by the Noble Consort Chu.

306
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
The deep palace is full of doors.

307
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
We're not by your side.

308
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
What if Her Highness's tragic story

309
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
is repeated?

310
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
I have the value of using.

311
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Andi won't kill me.

312
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I grew up in the cold palace

313
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
of the Wu Kingdom.

314
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
The bitter and sweet in the palace

315
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
and the evil plan,

316
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
how could I not know?

317
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Don't worry.

318
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
I'll be more careful

319
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
and safe.

320
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I want to go back to Wudu with you.

321
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
But what can I do

322
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
after I go back?

323
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
In the future,

324
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I'm still just a gold sparrow

325
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
in the palace of the Wu Kingdom.

326
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
That's not the life I want.

327
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
You'd rather die than do it.

328
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I have it, too.

329
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
And I've killed people.

330
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Wouldn't I be the first to kill?

331
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
I've been the king for so long.

332
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
In the past few months,

333
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
I've been following you

334
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
through so many people and things

335
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
from Wudu to here.

336
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Seeing you,

337
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Brother Qian, Du Zhangshi,

338
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
and them,

339
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
to save my brother,

340
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
to put in all kinds of efforts,

341
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
even risk my life.

342
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
I've figured it out.

343
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
If I stay here,

344
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
and can fight for the peace

345
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
of our two countries,

346
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
even if it takes three years,

347
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
or five years,

348
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
it's worth it.

349
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
You've grown up.

350
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
I'll listen to you.

351
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I'll listen to you.

352
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Okay.

353
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Take this.

354
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
If you encounter an emergency,

355
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
go to Jinshan Road or Jinbaozhan

356
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
to find Meiniang.

357
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Okay.

358
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
My people are outside.

359
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
The only place where Andu branch is located

360
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
is called Ye Guang.

361
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
You can trust him.

362
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
If you need anything, go find him.

363
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Okay.

364
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
By the way,

365
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
we've already taken Mr. Du in.

366
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
He heard that you insisted

367
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
to come here.

368
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
If he can accompany you

369
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
to the Li Palace,

370
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
we can be more assured.

371
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
And,

372
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
take this puzzle.

373
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
If you encounter any danger,

374
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
your brother will receive the news

375
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
and come to save you immediately.

376
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
I'll let Ye Guang

377
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
arrange the rest.

378
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Don't worry.

379
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
I'm Ning Yanzhou's sister.

380
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
I'm Ren Ruyi's disciple.

381
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
I won't embarrass you.

382
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I believe

383
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
our little Ying

384
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
has always been the best.

385
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Ruyi,

386
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
if you have a little niece,

387
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
call her Ying, okay?

388
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
I'll give her

389
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
all my best jewelry.

390
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Okay.

391
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
What?

392
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
You won't give it to a boy?

393
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
I like girls.

394
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
I'll listen to you.

395
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
In my previous life,

396
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
the luckiest thing was to meet

397
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
a gentle and kind empress.

398
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
In the future,

399
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
little Ying will also have the same luck.

400
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
Let's go.

401
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Take care, Ying.

402
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
You too.

403
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Don't worry too much.

404
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
With Ye Guang and others,

405
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
it must be safer

406
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
than sending Ying back

407
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
to our two court prisoners.

408
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
That's right.

409
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Where are we going now?

410
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Sheng Sha and others are heading to Hexian.

411
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
We'll go there as soon as possible

412
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
and meet them.

413
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Great.

414
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I miss them too.

415
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Let's see if Yuan Xiaolu

416
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
will listen to us.

417
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
What are you laughing at?

418
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm laughing

419
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
that I don't have to

420
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
go to you

421
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
with my whole body.

422
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
I can come back to life

423
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
in time.

424
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
It's the happiest thing

425
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
in the world.

426
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
If time is like a wave

427
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
It's like a wind

428
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
It's like a wind

429
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Who and I are going to travel far away

430
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,760
The sky is full of clouds

431
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
The sky is full of clouds

432
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
You are mine.

433
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Love is the yellow rain between the two of us

434
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Life and death are ordinary

435
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
We are only at the last step.

436
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
When he sends Sheng Sha back to Wu Guo safely,

437
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
we will leave everything behind.

438
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
From then on,

439
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
we will be ordinary people.

440
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
The world is big.

441
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
We can go wherever we want.

442
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Okay?

443
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Okay.

444
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
But

445
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
according to

446
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,760
what did you forget?

447
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
I didn't forget.

448
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
I didn't forget.

449
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
The sound of heartbeats

450
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,760
The sound of heartbeats

451
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
The sound of heartbeats

452
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
The sound of heartbeats

453
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
The sound of heartbeats

457
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760

458
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760

460
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
The sound of heartbeats

461
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
The sound of heartbeats

462
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
The sound of heartbeats

463
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
The sound of heartbeats

470
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
The sound of heartbeats

471
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760

497
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760

The sound of heartbeats

508
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Yang,

509
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Did he mention me?

510
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Yes.

511
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
He heard Sha Xi's voice.

512
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,760
He came here because you were worried about something.

513
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,760
So he rushed here without thinking about the injury.

514
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
But he didn't expect it was me.

515
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
I knew it.

516
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Go!

517
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
When we arrive outside the gate,

518
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
are you sure they can open the gate?

519
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Don't worry.

520
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
When we arrive outside the gate,

521
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
we will call the guards to open the gate.

522
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
You just need to hide in the mountain.

523
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Don't let the guards see you.

524
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
Okay.

525
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Okay.

526
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
I believe you.

527
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Your Highness.

528
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Do we really need to open the gate and let the guards in?

529
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
When the gate is opened,

530
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
there will be a fight between the two sides.

531
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,760
This place is cold and poor.

532
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
I am dying here.

533
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
It's none of my business if I fight or not.

534
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Father would rather let me go.

535
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
You don't believe that I didn't kill the boss.

536
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
If so,

537
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,760
don't blame me for learning from father

538
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
and working with the traitors.

539
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Please open the gate and let the traitors in three times.

540
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
This is a big crime.

541
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Nonsense.

542
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
The North has a hard time.

543
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I talked with the King of Youxian.

544
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
This time,

545
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,760
as long as they get enough gold and food,

546
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
I will ascend the throne.

547
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
I will ascend the throne.

548
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
I will ascend the throne.

549
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I will ascend the throne.

550
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I will kill thousands of people every year.

551
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
I will kill thousands of people every year.

552
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
But...

553
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
Shut up.

554
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
You forgot that you and I

555
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,760
were trapped in the stock market

556
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
for three days and three nights

557
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,760
to find the food to repair the gate.

558
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
We were so hungry that we could only eat grass.

559
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,760
If it weren't for these traitors,

560
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,760
we would have died in this cold place.

561
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
I also know

562
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
those traitors

563
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
who think I am a fool

564
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
and don't care about my life

565
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
or my father.

566
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Since they are heartless,

567
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
don't blame me.

568
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Sun Lang.

569
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Where are we?

570
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Your Majesty,

571
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:11,540
the

572
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Your Majesty.

573
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
Ren Luo.

574
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Ren Luo.

575
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Ren Luo.

576
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Wake up.

577
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Stop.

578
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Stop.

579
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Your Majesty.

580
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
As I said,

581
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:54,520
can we see the

582
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
next city?

583
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Brother Qian.

584
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Forget it.

585
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
I have been driving all night.

586
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
I am a little bored.

587
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Why don't we go with Qian Qing?

588
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Yes.

589
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Where is my wine?

590
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
Here.

591
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Your Majesty, please wash the glasses.

592
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
I will go with you.

593
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Brother Lang.

594
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Brother Qian is too kind to His Majesty.

595
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
He even went to the police with him.

596
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
He even made you carry good wine.

597
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
His Majesty has been locked up for so long.

598
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
It's good to be the queen.

599
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
It's good to be a commoner.

600
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Who doesn't have a noble hobby?

601
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
You can say you are lazy.

602
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
No matter where I go,

603
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
no matter how tired I am,

604
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
as long as I touch

605
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
the soft, fragrant, fluffy

606
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
little cat, little dog, little rabbit,

607
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,760
I will hug it in my arms.

608
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
I will...

609
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I will...

610
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Humph.

611
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
This is not a place

612
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
for showbiz.

613
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Please take a closer look.

614
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Qian Qing,

615
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
I can't see anything.

616
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Have you ever thought

617
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
what the scenery

618
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
would be like

619
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
if the soldiers

620
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
who died in Tianmen Pass

621
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
were here?

622
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
This is...

623
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
That's right.

624
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
A few months ago,

625
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
His Majesty's army was defeated.

626
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Brothers!

627
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Today,

628
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,760
the blood of the dog emperor

629
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
will be on the line!

630
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
The blood of the dog emperor

631
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
will be on the line!

632
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
When I open the gate

633
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
and make all the arrangements,

634
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
I will hang a red cloak

635
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
on my horse back.

636
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Then you can lead the army

637
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,760
to the gate.

638
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Your Highness,

639
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
you're finally back!

640
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
I've been looking for you

641
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
for days!

642
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
I didn't find anything.

643
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
I was injured.

644
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Open the gate!

645
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Yes!

646
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Open the gate!

647
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Right.

648
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Cover the wound

649
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
on the horse back.

650
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
What's going on?

651
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Your Highness,

652
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
I couldn't find you

653
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
and I was worried sick.

654
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
The imperial edict

655
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
that summoned you back

656
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
arrived yesterday.

657
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Your Highness,

658
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
hurry up and change your clothes.

659
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
What imperial edict?

660
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Your Highness,

661
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
the eunuch who sent the edict

662
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
told me in private

663
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
that His Majesty

664
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
was going to marry the witch.

665
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
He said that

666
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
the witch is a woman.

667
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
He said that

668
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
the witch is a woman.

669
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
He said that

670
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
the witch is a woman.

671
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
He said that

672
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
the witch is a woman.

673
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
He said that

674
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
the witch is a woman.

675
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
He said that

676
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
His Majesty

677
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
is going to marry the witch

678
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
and will not leave the country.

679
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Princess Li Cheng

680
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
will be the crown princess.

681
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
When His Highness

682
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
arrives in the capital,

683
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
he will be the crown prince

684
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
in the next nine years.

685
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Congratulations, Your Highness!

686
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,760
Congratulations, Your Highness!

687
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Open the gate!

688
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Open the gate!

689
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
The ghost is coming!

690
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
Open the gate!

691
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Open the gate!

692
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Open the gate!

693
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Open the gate!

694
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Open the gate!

695
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Hurry!

696
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Close the gate!

697
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Hurry!

698
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Hurry!

699
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
What should we do?

700
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Are we running away?

701
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Look carefully!

702
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
This is His Highness!

703
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Your Highness,

704
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
what should we do?

705
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Don't be afraid.

706
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
We will sneak out

707
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
of the North Sea to get your clothes.

708
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Anyway,

709
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
the North Sea is going to the river.

710
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
We will sneak out of the river to get your clothes.

711
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Anyway,

712
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
the North Sea is going to the river.

713
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Anyway,

714
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
the North Sea is going to the river.

715
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Anyway,

716
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
the North Sea is going to the river.

717
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
It was not our Da'an before.

718
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
It doesn't matter how many people died.

719
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
It doesn't matter how many people died.

720
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
As long as my father doesn't know,

721
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
as long as the North Sea people don't let me out,

722
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
as long as the North Sea people don't let me out,

723
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
I can still be the crown prince.

724
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
I can still be the crown prince.

725
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
I still don't have a way to get through the enemy.

726
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
I still don't have a way to get through the enemy.

727
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Your Highness, let's go.

728
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Let's go.

729
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
This way.

730
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Let's go.

731
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Iron Wolf!

732
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Release the enemy!

733
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
Release the enemy!

734
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Release the enemy!

735
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
Brother Lang.

736
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Brother Lang.

737
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
What are you looking at?

738
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
You haven't come back yet.

739
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Did something happen?

740
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
He hasn't arrived yet.

741
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
He can't die here.

742
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Even if he dies,

743
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
he has to end the world.

744
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Let's go and have a look.

745
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Brother Qian.

746
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Qian.

747
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Brother Qian.

748
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Don't come over.

749
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Brother Qian,

750
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
what are you doing?

751
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
For the Chai Ming,

752
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
for the brothers of the Sixth Taoist Church,

753
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,760
for the countless soldiers of the Great Wu,

754
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm going to make an explanation.

755
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Qian,

756
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
calm down first.

757
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
That is His Majesty.

758
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
His Majesty?

759
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
If you dare to ask His Majesty,

760
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
I will tell him to stop.

761
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
I will tell him to stop.

762
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
Then I dare to ask His Majesty,

763
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
does he still remember those

764
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
souls who died for him?

765
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
The safe buttons of the Sixth Taoist Church.

766
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Qian,

767
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
why are all the brothers' safe buttons

768
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
with you?

769
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
A move to get rid of the chaos.

770
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
If I don't keep their last thing,

771
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
who else will remember them?

772
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Shi Xiaoyu.

773
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
She entered the Sixth Taoist Church at the age of nine.

774
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
She was once the fastest runner

775
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
in the Heavenly Path.

776
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
But she died in the battle

777
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
of Tianmen Pass.

778
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
She was killed by a blow.

779
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
She is only sixteen years old now.

780
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Dong Dashan.

781
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Twenty-one years old.

782
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Twenty-one years old.

783
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
She was afraid of heat.

784
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
But she was burned to death

785
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
by the information of the Lord An.

786
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
Guan Qing.

787
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Twenty-four years old.

788
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
She just got married before the battle.

789
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,760
But she never experienced the joy of playing with the child.

790
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
She was killed by Lord An.

791
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
She died of a heart attack.

792
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Yan Jun.

793
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
To protect the Emperor of Gou.

794
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
On the 29th birthday,

795
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
Yan Jun was released from the battlefield

796
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
with his six long guns.

797
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Gou Ping.

798
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
He was a drunkard for 33 years before he died.

799
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
But he was stabbed by his 18th gun.

800
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,760
He never drank the poison-free Dong Dashan again.

801
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Qin Bin.

802
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
He was 48 years old.

803
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
He had no wife and no children.

804
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
He had experienced the battlefield of Rong City,

805
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Tian City,

806
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Pingying,

807
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
and Ju Langguan.

808
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
He died of 38 shots

809
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,760
in the battle of Tianmen Pass.

810
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,760
He was also the ruler of Da Wu.

811
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I'm sorry.

812
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
What's the use of knowing you're wrong now?

813
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Can you change their lives if you know you're wrong now?

814
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Can you change my brother's life

815
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
if you know you're wrong now?

816
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
This Aimin...

817
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
This Aimin...

818
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
This Aimin is your brother.

819
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
You don't know yet.

820
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
This Aimin

821
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,760
is my brother.

822
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
I hated him since I was a kid.

823
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
But he was so shameless.

824
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,760
He always tried to kill me.

825
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
He knew I was a part of the Yuling Army.

826
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
He tried so hard to get into Liudotang.

827
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,760
He said he could see me often in the palace.

828
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,760
No matter how I tried to find an excuse to punish him,

829
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
no matter how he looked at me,

830
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
he would call me

831
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
my brother

832
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
the next time we met.

833
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,760
I wanted to beat him up

834
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
a few more times.

835
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,760
When I was 20 years old,

836
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,760
I would stop beating him.

837
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I would accept him as my brother.

838
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,760
But who would have thought

839
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
he was so good at the Heaven's Law

840
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
and was brought to the battlefield by you?

841
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
I'm sorry.

842
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
He would write me letters every day I went out of the city.

843
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Brother,

844
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
I always try to persuade His Majesty

845
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
not to be too careful.

846
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
But His Majesty just wouldn't listen.

847
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
Brother,

848
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
His Majesty is too greedy.

849
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
We have to kill over 3,000 people every day.

850
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
We have to kill over 3,000 people every day.

851
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
We have to kill over 3,000 people every day.

852
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
We have to kill over 3,000 people every day.

853
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
I was the only brother in this world

854
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,760
who didn't have time to listen to me call him brother.

855
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Just to protect you from the evil eye.

856
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Your Majesty, be careful!

857
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I stabbed you in the back.

858
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
I tried to kill him myself.

859
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Right here.

860
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,760
I stabbed him in the back.

861
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
He was only 19 years old.

862
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
I'm sorry.

863
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
What is the life of the six realms?

864
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
The soul of the reincarnation?

865
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
What is the whole world?

866
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,760
The world is dead and the dead are alive.

867
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,760
From the day I set out,

868
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,760
I secretly planned to save you

869
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
and bring you here.

870
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,760
I used your life

871
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
to make the dead souls of the world see the truth.

872
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
Brother Chen,

873
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,760
the world is not a crime.

874
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,760
I understand.

875
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,760
You want to avenge your brothers and Brother Cai.

876
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,760
We want to do the same.

877
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,760
But have you forgotten

878
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,760
what Ning Tuo said when he handed you his body?

879
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,760
Do you deserve to be punished?

880
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Brother!

881
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
Brother, calm down!

882
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
You dare to stop me

883
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,760
just for this bastard?

884
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
Who wants to separate in a lifetime?

885
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,760
The sky is dark and the road is slippery.

886
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,760
Looking back, the future is so beautiful.

887
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,760
The world is cold and the past is still cold.

888
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,760
Who will stay for the rest of their lives?

889
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,760
Who is drunk and worried?

890
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,760
The heart is tasteless.

891
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,760
Who wants to dream of the future?

892
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,760
Only for the wind to come back.

893
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,760
The world is cold and the past is still cold.

894
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,760
How many years have passed?

895
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:55,760
No one will be drunk forever.
