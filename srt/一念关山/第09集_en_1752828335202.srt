The stars are in the clouds, the clouds are gone

The wind blows the clouds away, the clouds are gone

How would you do there

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,940
The manager of the surface

16
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,900

did that

21
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,060
it's not

Episode 16

23
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,060
Bastard!

24
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
You're so useless.

25
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,060
You only care about the promotion of your sister?

26
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,060
Commander Jiang is a bit of a loser.

27
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,060
It's a pity that she's already dead.

28
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,060
Please forgive me, sir.

29
00:02:50,060 --> 00:03:02,060
I have something to tell you.

30
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,060
I have a villains level information.

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Do you want to take away my senior captain?

32
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,060
Or my senior captain?

33
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,060
I've been died for seven days.

34
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,060
Did they license anyone else to defeat me?

35
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,060
You can't do anything about it.

36
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Otherwise, you, Zhu Yiwei's maid,

37
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,060
will be done for.

38
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
Your Majesty.

40
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,060
The light will only work.

41
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Why did His Majesty send her to manage the fire?

43
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,060
He was afraid that Zhu Yiwei's power was too strong.

44
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
Her father died in Bai Que's hands.

45
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,060
So he hates Zhu Yiwei.

46
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,060
He even thinks that all women in Zhu Yiwei's family

47
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060
deserve to die.

48
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Let's not talk about this.

49
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,060
Why hasn't Yue San Niang warned us yet?

50
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,060
Why haven't we heard from her yet?

51
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
I...

52
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,060
I'm afraid that something bad has happened to her.

53
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,060
We couldn't find Yue San Niang's body.

54
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,060
We only found two dead people in the accident.

55
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
They all pointed to Ruyi.

56
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,060
We found the body of the jade wolf.

57
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,060
But...

58
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
The fish bit it clean.

59
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,060
We couldn't find any wounds.

60
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,060
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,060
She was so clean.

62
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
She's an expert.

63
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,060
Your Majesty, look.

64
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,060
In the words of these two men,

65
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,060
Yue San Niang said that Ruyi is a person who does things...

66
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Shut up.

67
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
His Majesty ordered that you don't mention this name.

68
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,060
Did you forget?

69
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,060
Yes.

70
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,060
We found Yue San Niang's body.

71
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
It can't be him.

72
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Although Tian Lang was in trouble back then,

73
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
he took the letter and dug his body.

74
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,060
But he left a piece of the bone.

75
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
I also checked it.

76
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
There are some marks on the bones.

77
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
It looks exactly the same as the Dingsing that he made in Chu.

78
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
It doesn't look like a six-storied pagoda.

79
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,300
Our country just lost this time

80
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,100
At this time, I'm afraid that I won't be able to cope by myself

81
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,380
And this path is not the Bran SUBSCRIBE

82
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Obedience makes one employees unwell

83
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,420
So Ruyi was disguised by the evil people

84
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,460
She knew that you would take a large amount of gold with you

85
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,860
and then use it to build a flag

86
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,580
Then she borrowed the name of that person to intimidate the other people

87
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,340
Send an order to all the branches of Lingyu Heng

88
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,300
to investigate the evil people and you

89
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,580
Also, send a group of people to check the foundation of the Wu State

90
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Yes

91
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Go

92
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
Zhaoxiao

93
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Zhaoxiao

94
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,260
You are recovering well

95
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,820
Thank you for inviting me, my lord

96
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,260
to build a flag-picking valley for me

97
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
You recognize her?

98
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,460
The only thing is Zhu Ji and Jialin's family name

99
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,460
His majesty will return to the capital three days later

100
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
The direction they are going to now

101
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,860
is the Wu State

102
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
That's right

103
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,860
The Wu State delegation will depart for a few days

104
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,060
You can talk to the leader of the Wu State, right?

105
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,460
How about you go to him a few more times these days?

106
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,260
When the delegation arrives

107
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,460
His majesty will definitely send more people

108
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,460
Even if it's just a companion

109
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,860
it's better than being like this and always recovering

110
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,660
I have no job

111
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,060
I'm just a guard of the Winged Forest

112
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,460
His majesty wants me to be idle

113
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,660
so I can only be idle

114
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,860
I have been waiting until he feels I'm enough to be at ease

115
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,460
The day that I can be useful

116
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,260
is my chance

117
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Before you start

118
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,260
you have to be more patient than everyone

119
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,460
When you start

120
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,460
you have to be more cruel than everyone

121
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,660
This is what you used to say

122
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,260
So you remember it all the time

123
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Yes

124
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,060
I never forgot it

125
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,860
Contact our leader right away

126
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
I want to know

127
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,260
how long before the Queen of Changqing leaves the capital

128
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
will she enter the palace

129
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,860
What's the secret between her and the Noble Consort Chu?

130
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,860
Yes

131
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,460
Go

132
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,260
Soldiers

133
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,060
Yesterday in Tianxingxia was hard

134
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Today everyone let go of food and drink

135
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,460
Tomorrow we will continue to rush

136
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,660
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard

137
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,260
Eat more

138
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,460
Everyone has worked hard

139
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Hard, hard

140
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,860
Hard, hard, hard

141
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,260
Eat well, drink well

142
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Hard, hard, hard

143
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
Eat more, drink more

144
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,060
Hard, hard, hard

145
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,660
Come, cheers

146
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,460
Drink more, drink more

147
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,260
Lord Su

148
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,660
Yes

149
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Drink, drink, come

150
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,460
Come, come, come

151
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,860
Drink quickly

152
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Come, come, come

153
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Drink, drink, drink, drink

154
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,860
The one who is still in the throne wants to enjoy with you

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
But you can't enjoy with you all the time

156
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,860
When the Yangtze River is ready

157
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,060
You can have a drink

158
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,260
Come, come, come

159
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,060
Fill it up

160
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,260
Kick it up with my own

161
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,260
We bought twenty bottles of good wine to thank everyone

162
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,260
Congratulations, Your Majesty

163
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,660
Cheers, Your Majesty

164
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,860
Thank you

165
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,860
I was going to let you teach him some official affairs of the country

166
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,660
I didn't expect you to teach him how to be a real king

167
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,860
I also taught my subordinates

168
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,260
Since you have received my love

169
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,460
From now on, my affairs will be up to you

170
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Good, good, good

171
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,060
Good, good, good

172
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Good

173
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Give me a bowl too

174
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,060
How can you enjoy with a bowl?

175
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,260
You have to use a pot

176
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,060
Come, beauty, cheers

177
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Good, good, good

178
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Good, good, good

179
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Good, good, good

180
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
Give me one

181
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Give me one

182
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,660
Come on, one, one

183
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,460
One at a time

184
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,460
Do one

185
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,460
Good

186
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,060
Oh my god

187
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,660
Good, good, good

188
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,100
Bravo!

189
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,980
Bravo!

190
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,140
Bravo!

191
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,540
Look at you!

192
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,520
Miss Ruyi...

193
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,740
Hurry up!

194
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,440
Miss Ruyi!

195
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,200
Honestly, it was a very nice time for sports.

196
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,400
I got to know how important it could be to be on the same team.

197
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,380
But we didn't sit down and do our play-off.

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,120
because the only thing that we knew

199
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,980
was that we were gonna start away from the top.

200
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Great!

201
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Great!

202
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Great!

203
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Great!

204
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,980
Great!

205
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,980
Great!

206
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,980
Sister Ru Yi, you are so beautiful!

207
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Great!

208
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Great!

209
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,980
Great!

210
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Great!

211
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Great!

212
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,980
Great!

213
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,980
Great!

214
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
See?

215
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,980
I didn't take the initiative.

216
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
I left my horse yesterday.

217
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
I left you two a space to get along.

218
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
Why are you like this?

219
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
I can't blame you.

220
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Or you are just a beauty.

221
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Shut up!

222
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
Great!

223
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
Are you okay?

224
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,980
I'm fine.

225
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,980
How is it?

226
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Delicious!

227
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Brother Yuan Lu is here.

228
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,980
Yuan Lu, are you feeling better?

229
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
Much better.

230
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Yuan Lu, Yuan Lu.

231
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,980
You can't drink.

232
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Eat something.

233
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Okay, I got it.

234
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,980
Sit.

235
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Sister Ru Yi.

236
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Great!

237
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Let's go to the oven.

238
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
Drink. I'll wait for you.

239
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
Great!

240
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
Great!

241
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Why?

242
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
I think you don't like being taken care of.

243
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
You don't want others to treat you as a patient.

244
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
You just want to drink like a normal person.

245
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Eat meat.

246
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
That's right.

247
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
I always think so.

248
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
As long as I can breathe, I can eat and drink.

249
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
What's the big deal?

250
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
I can make money every day.

251
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,980
Don't be so hard on yourself.

252
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
In terms of my life and death,

253
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
I drink more than you.

254
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,980
But in terms of understanding Ning Teng,

255
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,980
I'm better than any of you.

256
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Sister Ru Yi,

257
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
I saw you there.

258
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Do you want to make Ning Teng jealous?

259
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
No.

260
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
You used to be hard on him.

261
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
He didn't listen to you.

262
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
So you want to change your way.

263
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
You don't force him.

264
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
You want to make him jealous.

265
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Right?

266
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
Do you think

267
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
this is a good idea?

268
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
No.

269
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
Ning Teng has done this a lot.

270
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Many of his daughters used to do this to him.

271
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
For our relationship,

272
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Ning Teng is

273
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
very stubborn.

274
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,980
He can't stand

275
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
being in the water.

276
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
He didn't like me before.

277
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
I just held his leg and didn't let go.

278
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
I didn't care.

279
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
Look at him now.

280
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
He can't stand

281
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
being treated so well.

282
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
So you have to follow his will

283
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
and get along with him.

284
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
He loves to eat sweets.

285
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
He doesn't take the initiative to say yes.

286
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
He likes to dig things in private.

287
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
If you ask him, he won't give you.

288
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
But he is very happy.

289
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Sister Ru Yi, you are so good.

290
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Brother 13,

291
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
why are you so late?

292
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Come here.

293
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
The sun smells so good.

294
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Your Highness, go dance.

295
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
I don't know how to dance.

296
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Let's go.

297
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,980
I don't know how to dance.

298
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
Your Highness, come on.

299
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Sister Ru Yi.

300
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Good.

301
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Look at this.

302
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
I haven't seen Ning Kong so happy for a long time.

303
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Look at Miss Ru Yi.

304
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
She is so good.

305
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
Is this a martial art?

306
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
It seems so.

307
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Give me a piece.

308
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Try it.

309
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
It's so good.

310
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Try it.

311
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Give me a piece.

312
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
It's so good.

313
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,980
I tell you.

314
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Qian's cooking is so good.

315
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Your Highness,

316
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
I have a secret for you.

317
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Wang Yu Chu once wanted to bring Qian back

318
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
to be his assistant.

319
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Really, Brother Qian?

320
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
You know how to sell,

321
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
how to open a shop, how to make a seal.

322
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Now you can cook.

323
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
Is there anything you don't know?

324
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
Yes.

325
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
What?

326
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,980
To have a baby.

327
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Can I eat this piece of fish?

328
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Give me another piece.

329
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Come on.

330
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Come on.

331
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Move over there.

332
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Be careful.

333
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Be careful.

334
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Ding Hui.

335
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Yes.

336
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
Sun Lang.

337
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Zhu Yi Bei's power is quite strong.

338
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,980
He should be here at night.

339
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
Yes.

340
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Come with me.

341
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
I have a good thing for you.

342
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
Take it.

343
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
I bought the bean paste buns at the entrance.

344
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
But this time,

345
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I used Qian's fish to bake the paste.

346
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,980
There is honey inside.

347
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Be careful.

348
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
What do you want?

349
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
What else can it be?

350
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
Of course, it's good for you.

351
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Others don't know.

352
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
I don't know.

353
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,980
They are just giving you face.

354
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
They are afraid that they will scare you.

355
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
So they are playing a trick on us.

356
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Then they will be good to you.

357
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,980
This is called

358
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
being a good person.

359
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
You are a good person.

360
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,980
You are a good person.

361
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Then they will be good to you.

362
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
This is called

363
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,980
being a good person.

364
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,980
Anyway,

365
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,980
you should keep an eye on him.

366
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,980
I can keep an eye on him for you.

367
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
But you won't be jealous.

368
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
Our mission this time

369
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,980
is not to send the wind and rain.

370
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,980
We are here to escort you to the temple

371
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,980
to prove the God's name.

372
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
Yes.

373
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,980
The battle with Tian Xing Xia

374
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
was a good match.

375
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,980
So...

376
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
He is good.

377
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
But he is not confident.

378
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
I forgot that

379
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
the bad guys in Chu

380
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
are not as good as the bad guys in our six temples.

381
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,980
If you are really good to him,

382
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,980
when his identity is exposed,

383
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
the brothers in the Tao will still make trouble.

384
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
No wonder you don't want to

385
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,980
do something like this.

386
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,980
You are indeed the leader of the hall.

387
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Enough.

388
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Anyway, don't let him know about this.

389
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
You did everything.

390
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,980
You are afraid that he will be sad?

391
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,980
I will be sad too.

392
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
Ning,

393
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,980
don't do this again

394
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,980
when you meet your beloved lady.

395
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Once your beloved lady's heart is broken,

396
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
you will be in a deep trouble.

397
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Who said I like her?

398
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,980
Stop.

399
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Go.

400
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
I mean the lady you like.

401
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,980
I didn't say it was her.

402
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
What's wrong?

403
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,980
She wants to learn how to ride a horse.

404
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
Come.

405
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Hold the rope.

406
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
The rope.

407
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Don't pull it too hard.

408
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Relax your hands.

409
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Move your arms along the horse.

410
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Hold the rope.

411
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Shake it gently.

412
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
Let him think you are kind.

413
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Hello, horse.

414
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
Yuan Lu, take her for a walk.

415
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
No problem.

416
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Don't worry, your highness. I am a horse.

417
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Straighten your waist.

418
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
Use your feet to slowly lift her belly.

419
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Where do you want to go?

420
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Where do you want to go?

421
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
Turn right.

422
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,980
Turn right.

423
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Turn around.

424
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,980
Turn around.

425
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Turn around.

426
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Don't worry, your highness.

427
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
I am here.

428
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
You are riding so well.

429
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Slowly.

430
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
You are great.

431
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Yes.

432
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
You are great.

433
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Really?

434
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,980
Am I good?

435
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Don't worry, your highness. I am here.

436
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Yuan Lu.

437
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Yuan Lu.

438
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Yuan Lu.

439
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Yuan Lu.

440
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Yuan Lu.

441
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Yuan Lu. Yuan Lu.

442
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
You learn fast.

443
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Don't worry.

444
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Why don't you let me ride for a while?

445
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
I am not tired at all.

446
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,980
How come?

447
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
Riding horse requires the most strength in the waist and legs.

448
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,980
You just learned it. Don't be greedy.

449
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,980
Did you practice the dagger you asked you to practice last time?

450
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,980
I did.

451
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Look at it.

452
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
Go.

453
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,980
Great.

454
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,980
How is it?

455
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Your highness, why are you in such a hurry?

456
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,980
I didn't apply the rouge on my face.

457
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
So I came here.

458
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
I want to ask you.

459
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
What is your elder brother's daughter's name?

460
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Her name is Chu Yue.

461
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Yes.

462
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Have you made a bet?

463
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,980
Chu Yue hasn't.

464
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
That girl is very wild.

465
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,980
She always wants to fight with my elder brother.

466
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
It's good that you haven't made a bet.

467
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
How about this?

468
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
I will make a bet for her.

469
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
What do you think?

470
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
Then I will

471
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
thank you

472
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
for Chu Yue's favor.

473
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
I don't know which family's son is the groom.

474
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Chu Yue's personality

475
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,980
is not something that ordinary people can handle.

476
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Don't worry.

477
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
Ordinary people can't.

478
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,980
Tong Guang

479
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
can.

480
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
Tong Guang?

481
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Why is it Chu Yue?

482
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
I don't want to.

483
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,980
His majesty just said it randomly.

484
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Maybe he will forget it in a few days.

485
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,980
His majesty will definitely marry her.

486
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
He is afraid that Chu Yue will marry the second son.

487
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Then

488
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
he will unite

489
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Sha Xi and Sha Dong.

490
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,980
The power of both sides

491
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,980
will threaten his position.

492
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Tong Guang will marry Yue.

493
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
It seems that he is

494
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
very grateful.

495
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
But my elder brother and Yue are so proud.

496
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
How can they be willing to have such a son-in-law?

497
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,980
When the time comes

498
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,980
when the couple is not happy

499
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
the power of Sha Xi

500
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
will never stand behind Tong Guang.

501
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Tong Guang will be

502
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
a fool forever.

503
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
I will tell the lord now.

504
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Let him know how sad you are because of this.

505
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
The lord is very loyal.

506
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
No matter what

507
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,980
he can be dragged for a few years.

508
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
He won't.

509
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,980
He has been

510
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
trying to get married earlier.

511
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
This marriage

512
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
is for the sake of his majesty.

513
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Xia

514
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
can be the master of Sha Xi for him.

515
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
He is so stubborn.

516
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
I know

517
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
he doesn't

518
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
like me like I like him.

519
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
I always know

520
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
he is just pretending

521
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,980
to be my wife.

522
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Just using me.

523
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
I am so hungry.

524
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
I am so hungry.

525
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
I am so hungry.

526
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,980
I am so hungry.

527
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
What are you doing?

528
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
You are just a beggar.

529
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,980
You are just a beggar.

530
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,980
What are you doing?

531
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
You dare to fight?

532
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
You are just a beggar.

533
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
Don't stop.

534
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Go to the capital.

535
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,980
Qian

536
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Yuan Lu

537
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Se Lang

538
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Come out and get the things.

539
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Those kids are so poor.

540
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Manager Ning

541
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
Can we help them?

542
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Your highness

543
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Last month, a oil flag passed by Linxian

544
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
and was in contact with Jiangcheng.

545
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,980
Some refugees escaped to Jiangcheng.

546
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Some refugees still

547
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
are still in exile.

548
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,980
There are still 200 miles

549
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,980
to go to the border.

550
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,980
We will meet many such people.

551
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,980
We can't save them.

552
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Can't we do something for them?

553
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
What you need to do now

554
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
is to learn from Ru Yi

555
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,980
and save your brother.

556
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,980
But we...

557
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,980
Your highness, we will meet the officials in two days.

558
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Come back to your room.

559
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,980
Master Du

560
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,980
The more people in Jing'an

561
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,980
the more people in the camp.

562
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
I will go to the city.

563
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
You should rest early.

564
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
Sun Lang

565
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Come

566
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Take my jade tally to Zhang Shixian

567
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,980
and ask him to help us settle the refugees.

568
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Yes, your highness.

569
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,980
You are the king of Wu.

570
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Stand up.

571
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
You don't need to say anything.

572
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
Just raise your hand.

573
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
When the other party is rude

574
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
and you can't fight back

575
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
the best way is not to talk.

576
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,980
When the other party is hitting the cotton

577
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,980
and you dare not to fight back

578
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
you can't fight back.

579
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
When the other party is hitting the cotton

580
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,980
and you dare not to fight back

581
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
the best way is not to talk.

582
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,980
Brother Yanzhou should be out.

583
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,980
Sister Ru Yi

584
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Did you see that?

585
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,980
There are some refugees in the city.

586
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,980
You want to

587
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,980
send something to those Qirs?

588
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,980
No.

589
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,980
You should deal with Anguo.

590
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,980
But I can take you there.

591
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,980
Really?

592
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,980
Sister, give us some money.

593
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
Sister, give me some money.

594
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,980
Sister, sister.

595
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,980
Sister, sister.

596
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
Sister, sister.

597
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,980
Sister, sister.

598
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980
Sister, sister.

599
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
Sister, sister.

600
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,980
It's you?

601
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,980
Yes.

602
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Yanzhou asked me to catch the medicine for Yuan Lu.

603
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,980
I have sent someone back.

604
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
But I just came out of the pharmacy, I saw you.

605
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,980
I was thinking

606
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,980
how much power has been restored.

607
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,260
Only 70% of the time.

608
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,260
Some of my joints have been injured for too long.

609
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
I can't get them out.

610
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,660
But even if I fully recover,

611
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,260
I might not be your opponent.

612
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,860
You admit defeat before the match.

613
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,060
That's not like you.

614
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,460
A killer wants to live long.

615
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,060
He has to know how to avoid

616
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,260
someone who is better than him.

617
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,860
You are indeed the best killer in the House of Cigarettes.

618
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,260
What did you buy after a long walk?

619
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,460
For you.

620
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
For me?

621
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,860
I saw your joints were sprained.

622
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,860
So I guess you like to carve things.

623
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,900
I happen to have a piece of

624
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,060
a piece of iron from the previous dynasty.

625
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,860
I just rubbed it.

626
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,500
I just walked around.

627
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,060
I have a cow's foot pen.

628
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,460
It's convenient for you to use.

629
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,260
Iron?

630
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,140
It's too expensive.

631
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,860
I can't take it.

632
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,740
Just take it.

633
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
I'm here to give you a gift.

634
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,620
I just want to please you.

635
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,420
Please me?

636
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,340
Why?

637
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,620
A woman wants to please a man.

638
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,620
What do you think?

639
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,620
I'm sorry.

640
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,620
Thank you.

641
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,620
By the way, the woman you mentioned,

642
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,620
she's the one who gave you the gift.

643
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,620
She's the one who gave you the gift.

644
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,620
She's the one who gave you the gift.

645
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,620
By the way, the woman you mentioned,

646
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
I don't know.

647
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,620
Of course, to ask you to do something.

648
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,620
You're about to enter the kingdom of Angu.

649
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,620
How are you going to find out

650
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
the murderer who killed Her Highness?

651
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
Don't just talk about the false news.

652
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,620
I want to know what you're going to do.

653
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
Don't worry.

654
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
I've thought about it.

655
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,620
I'm a little thirsty.

656
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,620
Why don't we sit down and talk?

657
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
Okay.

658
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,620
Your tea.

659
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,620
Thank you.

660
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,620
Enjoy.

661
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
Our headquarters in Liudatang

662
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,620
is in charge of analyzing all kinds of secret reports.

663
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
But many of the original files

664
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
are distributed in different countries.

665
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,620
Since Zhao Ji was in charge,

666
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,820
he kept the secret

667
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
but the Empress died five years ago.

668
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,620
So, we must have some information from him.

669
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,620
The so-called secret book is actually just a document.

670
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,620
For example, the letters between officials and officials.

671
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Also, the history of the official.

672
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Please rise.

673
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Thanks.

674
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,940
Put down all your duties,

675
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,780
including those that you inherited from me.

676
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,640
I'm sorry, Director Meng.

677
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,740
I did not recognize you.

678
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,880
But you didn't let me down in the act.

679
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,100
Good thing you weren't monks.

680
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,500
will leave some traces.

681
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,500
So...

682
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,500
So after we arrive in the Dark Realm,

683
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,780
I'll take you

684
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,020
to the secret room of our Chen Feng.

685
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,580
Find that file

686
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,860
and compare it again.

687
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,820
Then we can find out the key person

688
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,380
who called the empress to death.

689
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,620
Then we can start from those people.

690
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,140
Then we can find the real murderer.

691
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,060
Long Harvest

692
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,100
Congratulations!

693
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,620
Delighted

694
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,140
You seem to have said

695
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
You've been to An Guang before?

696
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
Yes.

697
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,140
I saw you six years ago when I was a Taoist.

698
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
Six years ago?

699
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,140
I went to Su Ge to assassinate the inner secretary, Fang Daoxi.

700
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,140
I was there.

701
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,140
Otherwise, I would have had my men arrest you.

702
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
You were so cruel.

703
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
I have to thank my long legs.

704
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
You ran fast.

705
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
It's weird.

706
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,140
We were both very strong in the six Taoist temples and Zhu Yiwei.

707
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
But we never met each other.

708
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Maybe we did.

709
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
I don't know.

710
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Just like that.

711
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,140
We just passed by each other.

712
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,140
The sound of heartbeats

713
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,140
The sound of heartbeats

714
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:25,140
The sound of heartbeats

715
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Waiting

716
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Waiting for us to meet again

717
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Waiting

718
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Waiting for us to meet again

719
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,140
I'll be with you.

720
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
Waiting for us to meet again

721
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,140
Waiting for us to meet again

722
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Loveyse

723
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,140
Loveyse

724
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,140
For you

725
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,140
For you

726
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,140
I will take this opportunity

727
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
I will take this opportunity

728
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,140
All the things i have

729
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,140
All the things i have

730
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:02,140
I will take this opportunity

731
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,140
You're all grown-up.

732
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,140
You're all grown-up.

733
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,940
But would you be the one to get me

734
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,340
To fumble like the NT

735
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,100
I know

736
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,560
But even though you alwaysаете

737
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,560
I need someone to protect me.

738
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,560
This is what Her Highness told me before.

739
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
I just moved here.

740
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
The Empress of Zhaoji is very nice to you.

741
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Of course.

742
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,560
She was with me when I entered the Zhu Yi Wei's company.

743
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:18,620
She died in the mission and in the

744
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
palace.

745
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:26,620
She taught me the ancient poem.

746
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,620
She taught me the ancient poem.

747
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:36,620
She taught me the ancient poem.

748
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,620
The Empress of Zhaoji is interesting.

749
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Actually, the Six Halls were also like Zhu Yi Wei.

750
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,620
They were punished severely and were in a state of

751
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
state of state.

752
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,620
But I always think that a good swordsman organization

753
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
shouldn't just pick good talents.

754
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,620
Ordinary people can also be successful as long as they work together.

755
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,620
Is this how Yuan Lu and the others came to you?

756
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,620
Yes.

757
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,620
For example, Shisan.

758
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,620
Her mother was a magistrate of the previous dynasty.

759
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,620
So she was born in the Jinyu Gang since she was a child.

760
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,620
She also grew up to be a cool character.

761
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,620
When she first joined the Asura Sect, she

762
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
harassed all the female spies she could.

763
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,620
I followed her behind her ass every day to clean up her mess.

764
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,620
I also gave her a whip every day.

765
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,620
That's how she slowly recognized me as a brother.

766
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,620
It's so nice to have a superior like you.

767
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,620
My luck is not as good as hers.

768
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,620
I still remember when I was seven years old,

769
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,620
the way the white-clothed maidservant took me away.

770
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,620
At that time, my father just bought me a candy.

771
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,620
He asked someone to take me away.

772
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,620
He stepped on the candy in front of me.

773
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,620
Then he pulled my 31-storied whip.

774
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,620
31-storied?

775
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,620
I swore in my heart that one day,

776
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,620
I would cut off 31 pieces of her flesh.

777
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,620
I would cut her into pieces.

778
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Did she return to you after you grew up?

779
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,620
She died in the Asura Kingdom's operation once.

780
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,620
Most of the women in the Asura Kingdom are less than 30 years old.

781
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,620
I'm almost 30 too.

782
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Don't be so pessimistic.

783
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,620
You've already left the Asura Kingdom.

784
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
The rain has stopped.

785
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Let's go back.

786
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,620
It's already so late. I'll go in first.

787
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Okay.

788
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,620
Tomorrow, tell me where you have your blood vessels.

789
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
I'll discuss it with Xianzhou and the others.

790
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620
I'll help you recover your power as soon as possible.

791
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,620
Thank you.

792
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,620
Wait.

793
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,620
Wait for me.

794
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
Wait for me.

795
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,620
Wait for me.

796
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,620
Wait for me.

797
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,620
Wait for me.
