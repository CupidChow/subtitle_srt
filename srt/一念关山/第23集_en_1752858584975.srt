the

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
the

the

the

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Yes

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:27,520
The beauty of the eyes, the frosty wind, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frosty clouds, the frost

gai dao mu ran hui shou wan wu weang

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Don't be lazy.

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
The kids don't like to eat.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Don't take classes.

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Use Dragon Crescent Bone

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
for a memory of your memories.

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
The third minute of the third episode,

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
I invite you to watch the movie

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
for a memory of your memories.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
I held it in.

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
According to what everyone told me before,

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
I turned against the An Guoran Army.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,520
I... I didn't lose face.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
You don't know, Ru Yi,

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
I learned from you.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
I looked at Shao Qing with my eyes.

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
He didn't dare to speak.

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
I... I was too crazy.

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
I really...

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Your Highness was indeed crazy today.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
You could still leave

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
when you were alone.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
You were brave and clever.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
You were brave and clever.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
I was not rude.

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Your Highness was really great.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,520
But if three days have passed,

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
what if the An Guoran King

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
still ignores us?

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Are we really leaving?

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
No.

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Okay.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Sheng...

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Brother An always likes to take a step back

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
and be kind to others.

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Today, I let you meet you

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
and let you touch the nail.

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Tomorrow, I will come to see you.

57
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
This way, I can personally

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
see your true colors.

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Really?

60
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Your Highness, I still want to know

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,520
what happened in the palace today.

62
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
It was the very beginning.

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
I went there and there was no one.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
When I saw that there was no one,

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
I was so scared.

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Later, I just...

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
I will go.

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Did Ying sleep?

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Yes.

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Ying woke up at three in the morning yesterday.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Today, she was in the palace

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
for one day.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
She ate something just now

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
and told us something about the palace.

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Then she fell asleep.

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
What happened to your hand?

77
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
When you were not here today,

78
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,520
I dressed up as a car driver

79
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
to observe the situation.

80
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
When I tied the rope,

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
I accidentally got a little tired.

82
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
I will apply some medicine for you.

83
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
I didn't break my skin.

84
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Why would I apply medicine?

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
You are worrying again.

86
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
You can't even bear to see this?

87
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
If something happens to me

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
at Zhu Yi Wei's place today,

89
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
what should you do?

90
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Then I will find another girl

91
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
to marry her

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
and have many children.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Then I will go to her wedding.

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Ying Yuan Zhou.

95
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
I told you not to give me this chance.

96
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
I don't want to hear you say

97
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
anything bad about me.

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
You told me

99
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
you would be with me forever.

100
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
I didn't mean to.

101
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
I know.

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
I know you are an assassin.

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
To complete your mission,

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,520
you can use your life as a price.

105
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
But you are not alone now.

106
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
You said you were going to revenge.

107
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Okay, I promise you.

108
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
You said you were going to Zhu Yi Wei.

109
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I won't stop you.

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
But I just can't stand you getting hurt.

111
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
I can't stand you

112
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
not taking your life seriously.

113
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I really can't stand...

114
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Enough.

115
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Stop talking.

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
I will come back safe and sound.

117
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
When we have a fight,

118
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
you can use this way to shut me up.

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
If you dare to mention another woman

120
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
in front of me,

121
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I promise you

122
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
you won't even have a chance to talk.

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
I'm wrong. I won't.

124
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
That's more like it.

125
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
You and Yuan Xiao Lu

126
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
have nothing to do with each other.

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Now you are asking me to come.

128
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
We, the people of Xiwu,

129
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
have nothing to do with each other

130
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
except for Zhao Men.

131
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
But...

132
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Now that I have you,

133
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
you are my weakness.

134
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
You've learned a lot from Yu Shi San.

135
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Do I need to learn from Yu Shi San?

136
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Don't worry.

137
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
I won't do anything tomorrow.

138
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
After all,

139
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
I want to find out

140
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
who killed my aunt and Ling Long.

141
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
When Jiao Er came into the palace today,

142
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
she would probably

143
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
mention to His Majesty

144
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
that the Zhu Yi Wei attacked her.

145
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
But Zhu Yi Wei didn't do anything.

146
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
I think that Deng Hui

147
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
is probably not in the capital today.

148
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
That's why His Majesty didn't summon her.

149
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
This person is in...

150
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I don't know.

151
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I don't know.

152
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,520
You only found Zhu Yi Wei after you left the Six Halls.

153
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Even you can't figure out her background.

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
I have to do something

155
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
when she is no longer under Zhu Yi Wei's pressure.

156
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
That's good.

157
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Andy will probably summon her tomorrow.

158
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
I have to accompany Ying to the palace.

159
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
When you leave,

160
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
bring the butterfly.

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
If there is an accident,

162
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
send the butterfly to beg for help.

163
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Don't drag me into it at this critical moment.

164
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I will arrange it.

165
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Look.

166
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
If we can do everything

167
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
as we did before,

168
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
that would be great.

169
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Then,

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
can you discuss with me

171
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
about the rescue?

172
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
At least,

173
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
I can guarantee Yan's safety

174
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
when you save her.

175
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Okay.

176
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Good night, Marquis.

177
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Good night, Marquis.

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Good night, Marquis.

179
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Leave us.

180
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Yes.

181
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I will go with you.

182
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Yes.

183
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Go.

184
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Marquis Changqing

185
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Explain.

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,520
I didn't do this.

187
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Since you asked me to take Zhu Yi Wei,

188
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
I didn't manage my subordinates well.

189
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
It's my fault.

190
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Please punish me.

191
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Marquis Changqing is my dog

192
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
and so is my dog.

193
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Zhu Yi Wei is my personal soldier.

194
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
How could someone

195
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,520
do this under my nose?

196
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
If you can't find out the truth,

197
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
you and the people below

198
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,520
will be punished with death.

199
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Yes.

200
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Also,

201
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Zhu Yi Wei

202
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,520
has colluded with the North Chinese.

203
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
You must find out the truth.

204
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Yes.

205
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Li Tongguang

206
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,520
may be exaggerating,

207
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
but I don't think

208
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,520
he is innocent.

209
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Yes.

210
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
But I think

211
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
even if someone

212
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
dares to collude with the court,

213
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,520
he will not dare to collude with the North Chinese.

214
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Li's Manor

215
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Tell the people of the Ministry of Rites

216
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,520
to come to the matter of the King of Li of the Wu State.

217
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Li's Manor

218
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
The man who was the maid of the palace

219
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
is my personal servant.

220
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
So the news should be reliable.

221
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Our people colluded with the North Chinese

222
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
to kill Marquis Changqing.

223
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Where?

224
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
What?

225
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
It must not be our people.

226
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
It should be Chen Gui.

227
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Chen Zuo Shi?

228
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Others can't mobilize so many people.

229
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
They don't have the courage.

230
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,520
But he sent dozens of people to Hexian.

231
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,520
We also sent dozens of people to Hexian.

232
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Zhu Ji and others are all in Hexian.

233
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,520
How should I explain this to Deng Hui?

234
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Are the North Chinese also related to that Ruyi?

235
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental

236
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
that they all appear in the same place?

237
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Then what should we do?

238
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
If His Majesty blames us,

239
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
according to Deng's command, the situation will be...

240
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
The news from the maid of the palace

241
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
is only for you.

242
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Does anyone else know?

243
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Then we'll leave now.

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Just say that I received news of Zhu Ji's death

245
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,520
and went out to investigate.

246
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
As long as we avoid the first storm,

247
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
when Deng Hui finishes the fire,

248
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
or when he kills Chen Gui,

249
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
even if we avoid it,

250
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
even if we are punished later,

251
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,520
he can't kill Zuo Shi and You Shi all at once.

252
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Yes.

253
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
We are here.

254
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Come and have a look.

255
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
This is our food.

256
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
We just picked it up this morning.

257
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
This radish is so juicy.

258
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Look.

259
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
This vegetable is good too.

260
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
The secret room of the Ministry of War

261
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
has brought me clothes

262
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,520
for the imperial guards.

263
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
The secret room of the Ministry of War

264
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Eunuch, this way please.

265
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Here.

266
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
My name was removed.

267
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Your Majesty.

268
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
His Majesty's order.

269
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Bring King Li of Wu State

270
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
to meet the King of Wu State

271
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
at Yongan Temple.

272
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Now?

273
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes.

274
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
His Majesty was busy yesterday.

275
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
He was very busy.

276
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
He felt sorry for you.

277
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
That's why he is so kind.

278
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
The King of Wu State

279
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
is very close to you.

280
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
He said he would meet you today.

281
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
He must be looking forward to it.

282
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Of course.

283
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I will go with you.

284
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Of course,

285
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
the rules are the same as yesterday.

286
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
All the officials can only accompany him.

287
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
He can't be on the altar.

288
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Please.

289
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Please wait.

290
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
I am wearing the long clothes now.

291
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
If you want to see my brother,

292
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
you need to dress up.

293
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
You can't be a military official.

294
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Mr. Du and Mr. Ning.

295
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Yes.

296
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
Help me change my clothes.

297
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Yes.

298
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
It's done.

299
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Your Highness.

300
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Yes.

301
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Yesterday, Miss Ruyi said

302
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
that the King of An State would give in.

303
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
I thought

304
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
it was just a call today.

305
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I didn't expect

306
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
to see you

307
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
in person.

308
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
The way of military service

309
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
is to make a promise.

310
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
And Jin Meiniang has been informed.

311
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,520
The An State has been suspecting you.

312
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
They suspect you

313
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
are not a real dragon.

314
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
You are just a substitute

315
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
who was pushed out temporarily.

316
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Maybe

317
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
the secret plan is to test him.

318
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
What should we do?

319
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
I have never seen my brother

320
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
and talked to him.

321
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
He is now locked on the altar.

322
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
I don't know the plan in China.

323
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
If I can't recognize him,

324
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
then it's...

325
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Your Highness.

326
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
His Majesty is wise and wise.

327
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
Since he knows

328
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
the news from the camp,

329
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
he must have prepared it.

330
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Don't panic.

331
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
But...

332
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Your Highness.

333
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
This is the old thing of the six hall.

334
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
His Majesty will recognize it.

335
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
But it has been changed.

336
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
If His Majesty can't recognize you

337
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
or he is mistaken,

338
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
you can press here.

339
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
There will be a small needle.

340
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
After he recognizes His Majesty,

341
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
he will be unconscious immediately.

342
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
At that time, you can say that he is excited

343
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
and stay and take care of him.

344
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Explain everything to him slowly.

345
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Okay.

346
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
But I'm still afraid.

347
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
What if...

348
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Your Highness.

349
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Fear is useless.

350
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Fear will only make things worse.

351
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Yesterday you were not in the position.

352
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
The first step is you.

353
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,520
But if you can't recognize it today,

354
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
it will be a success.

355
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
I understand.

356
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
I didn't expect Li Tongguang

357
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
to come back safely.

358
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
He is here.

359
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
If he finds out that we did it,

360
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
it will be troublesome.

361
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Your Highness.

362
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,520
I am Ding You, the assistant of the imperial examination.

363
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I have something urgent to report to you.

364
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Ding You.

365
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
It's about His Majesty's announcement

366
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
to the commander of the Deng's office today.

367
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
It seems...

368
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
It seems that Marquis Changqing is attacked.

369
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Speak.

370
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
My brother is a former eunuch.

371
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
He was on duty yesterday.

372
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,520
When he went out of the palace to buy food and said to me,

373
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Marquis Changqing came to the palace yesterday to meet His Majesty.

374
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I knew you had a problem.

375
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,520
You are always following the family's safety.

376
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Why did you suddenly come to me?

377
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
This is my territory.

378
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
You dare to assassinate me.

379
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
You are really bold.

380
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Really?

381
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
It's a pity.

382
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Before you, this was also my territory.

383
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
You are...

384
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
You are...

385
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
You are...

386
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
You are...

387
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
You are back.

388
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
You are not dead yet.

389
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Speak.

390
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Why did you collude with the North Korean and assassinate Marquis Changqing?

391
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,520
And why did you sell the whole Wudu branch for three thousand gold?

392
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
I have no idea about these things.

393
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
You know.

394
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
I have no patience.

395
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Do you want to die of pain?

396
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I did what Marquis Changqing did.

397
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
But I really don't know.

398
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I didn't collude with any North Korean.

399
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Big Prince.

400
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Or I will kill Marquis Changqing for him.

401
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
I dare not disobey.

402
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Dare not disobey?

403
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Did you forget that Zhu Yi Wei is the emperor's private soldier?

404
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I didn't forget.

405
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,520
His Majesty just treats us as a sheep.

406
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Even if it's you,

407
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
you are not my party.

408
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,520
You are just a place where nothing exists and nothing is known.

409
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I can only tell you.

410
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Zui Shang.

411
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Have you ever had this kind of panic?

412
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Zui Shang.

413
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Give me some antidote.

414
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Just a little bit.

415
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Just a little bit.

416
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
I didn't want to hurt you.

417
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
But you went to take revenge.

418
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Tell me.

419
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Did you do the thing of selling the Wudu branch?

420
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Yes.

421
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Hurry.

422
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Hurry.

423
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Hurry.

424
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
You go.

425
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
You come.

426
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Come.

427
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Come.

428
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Come.

429
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
You.

430
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
You.

431
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Hurry.

432
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Zhu Yi Wei's people?

433
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
That beauty, she...

434
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
She must have escaped.

435
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Let's go in.

436
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Stop.

437
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Stop.

438
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Let's go.

439
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Let's go.

440
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Everyone, please wait for a moment.

441
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Your Highness, please.

442
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Hurry.

443
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Hurry.

444
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Who knows him?

445
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
By the order of the gods,

446
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
I will let King of Wu, Li,

447
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
to explore the king of Wu.

448
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Your Highness.

449
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Your Highness.

450
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Who are you?

451
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Why are you in the harem?

452
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Who are you?

453
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Why are you in the harem?

454
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
You Anguars are really interesting.

455
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
You think I can't even recognize

456
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
my new brother?

457
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
Your Majesty.

458
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Ying.

459
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I heard that you came to the camp.

460
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
I knew it would be you.

461
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
This trip is dangerous.

462
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
My distant relatives

463
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
are not so brave.

464
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Ying.

465
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
You are indeed my brother.

466
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Your Majesty.

467
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
You two are...

468
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
No need to say more.

469
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I have something to say to Ying.

470
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
You can leave.

471
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Ying.

472
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Ying.

473
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I was worried that you

474
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
couldn't recognize me.

475
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
But I'm glad to have this.

476
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Even if I don't have

477
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
the token of the six Taoist temples,

478
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I will recognize you.

479
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,520
You are my sister.

480
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
You have suffered.

481
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Did you really bring

482
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
100,000 taels of gold?

483
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Now there are 50,000 taels of gold.

484
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
In addition,

485
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Mr. Ning Yuanzhou

486
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
changed the token

487
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
after entering the capital of Angu

488
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
to make the decision.

489
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
He was worried that the Anguars would go back.

490
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
So he had to wait

491
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
until we stepped out of the Anguars

492
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
and handed it to them.

493
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Ning Yuanzhou came?

494
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
But he was still worried

495
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
that the Anguars would test us.

496
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
So

497
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
there are five types of ointments

498
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
that correspond to five different

499
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
ways of transmission.

500
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
The first one is called the kite.

501
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
If you apply the ointment

502
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
with the same color as the kite,

503
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
the six Taoist temples

504
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
will connect with Ningqu.

505
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
We will try our best to rescue you.

506
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Okay.

507
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Okay.

508
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Okay.

509
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Okay.

510
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
You have considered

511
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
all the problems

512
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
that I have been thinking about

513
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
day and night.

514
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
What about your sister-in-law?

515
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
How is she?

516
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
She is in good health.

517
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
She is in good health.

518
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
It is normal for her to have a baby.

519
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I have a child.

520
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Okay.

521
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Okay.

522
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Okay.

523
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
What about

524
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Dan Yang?

525
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Dan Yang has been

526
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
busy with the country in Wudu.

527
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
When he was in the capital,

528
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
he told me repeatedly

529
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
that he must take back

530
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
my brother and the family.

531
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Did he ever say

532
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
what kind of identity

533
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
he wanted me to go back with?

534
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
The master of the five states

535
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
is still the imperial brother of Taishang.

536
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Brother, don't worry.

537
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Brother Dan Yang...

538
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Enough.

539
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
What you said

540
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
is what others have taught you.

541
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Dan Yang and I

542
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
have fought for the position

543
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
of Crown Prince for so many years.

544
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
I know very well

545
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
what kind of person he is.

546
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
I think he sent many people

547
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
to kill you

548
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
and stop you from getting back to the country.

549
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
As long as I can't go back,

550
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
he can take back

551
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
my throne

552
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
with a fair and proper way.

553
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Brother.

554
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Dan Yang.

555
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Brother.

556
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Dan Yang.

557
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Brother.

558
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Yang Xinyuan.

559
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Can you wait

560
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
until you get back to the country

561
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
safely?

562
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Now even you

563
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
dare to lecture me.

564
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
What did Dan Yang

565
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
give you?

566
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
You are willing to be his

567
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
tutor?

568
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I didn't dare to.

569
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
But brother,

570
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
isn't it because

571
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
of your selfishness

572
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,520
that caused me to be killed

573
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
by thousands of soldiers?

574
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
We have met for so long.

575
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Do you have a word

576
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
to say to me?

577
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Do you have a word

578
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
to say to me?

579
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I have asked those

580
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
soldiers who fought for you

581
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
and were wounded for you.

582
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Besides,

583
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
compared to these

584
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
empty and remote

585
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
positions and rights,

586
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
isn't it more

587
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
materialistic

588
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
and more precious

589
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
when we get back to the country?

590
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
I want to go back.

591
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I want to go back even in my dreams.

592
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Your Highness,

593
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
it's getting late.

594
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Wait a moment.

595
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Brother, I have one more thing to say.

596
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Do you remember

597
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
the six Taoist churches

598
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
of Hu Weining

599
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
and the Taoist priests of Tian Dao?

600
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Now there are rumors

601
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
spreading in the whole of the country.

602
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Many people are saying

603
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
that the six Taoist churches

604
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
and the Taoist priests

605
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
are good at military power

606
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
and betray the military.

607
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
This is how Tianmen Pass was defeated.

608
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Nonsense.

609
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Then,

610
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
can you please

611
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
send a letter

612
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
to Chai Ming

613
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
and his men

614
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
to order the blood source?

615
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I want to go out

616
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
and give it to Lord Ning later.

617
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
In this way,

618
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
the six Taoist churches

619
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
in the delegation

620
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
will be able to

621
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
work for you.

622
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
I'll do it now.

623
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
I still can't believe it.

624
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Why?

625
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
When Xue Zhiliu

626
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
released this Ning Yuanzhou,

627
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
I agreed.

628
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
He must have

629
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
a grudge against me.

630
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
How could he

631
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
willingly protect you

632
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
and go to the case

633
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
for his former subordinate?

634
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
He asked you

635
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
and me to get the blood source.

636
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
He is not a man

637
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
who can be trusted.

638
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
He asked you and me to get the blood source.

639
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
He is not here

640
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
to save me.

641
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
Brother, you misunderstood.

642
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
There is no such thing.

643
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Go back and tell Ning Yuanzhou

644
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
that he wants the blood source

645
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
unless he sends me

646
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
back to the Five Poison Sect safely.

647
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Otherwise,

648
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
let his brothers

649
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
of the Heavenly Cult

650
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
be cursed by the traitors.

651
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
The guards of the Heavenly Cult

652
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
are loyal to you.

653
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
How can you do this to him?

654
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
I can only do this.

655
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Ning Yuanzhou is

656
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
my only hope now.

657
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
I must go back.

658
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I must go back.

659
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Your Highness.

660
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Your Highness.

661
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
How is His Majesty?

662
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

663
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
His Majesty is very pleased

664
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
to know that you are loyal to him.

665
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Your Majesty.

666
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Even if I die,

667
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
I will not fail to

668
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
order His Majesty

669
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,520
to return to the Five Poison Sect.

670
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Mr. Du.

671
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Let's go back to the temple first.

672
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Yes.

673
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Let's go.

674
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,520
Did you get the message

675
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,480
from the

676
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Mechanical Box?

677
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
What's wrong?

678
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
What's wrong?

679
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Tell me.

680
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Did something happen to His Majesty?

681
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
I don't know.

682
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I don't know.

683
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
I don't know.

684
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Tell me.

685
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Did something happen?

686
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
I wanted to prove to my brothers

687
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
that I was right.

688
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
I tried to persuade him.

689
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
But he said

690
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
he didn't believe

691
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
that you would save him.

692
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
He said that he wanted to get the blood

693
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
source certificate

694
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
unless you could save him

695
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
from the dark valley first.

696
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
I knew it

697
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
was not that easy.

698
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
I'm sorry.

699
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
I never thought

700
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
that my brother would become like this.

701
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
He's not like this.

702
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
He's always been like this.

703
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
He's always been

704
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
a man who kills people like a grass sword.

705
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
He's a cat who eats a rat.

706
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,520
He's a cat who eats a rat.

707
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
It seems that the blood

708
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
from the Heaven Gate

709
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
didn't let him grow up.

710
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Let's go.

711
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,520
The wind blows in the night

712
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,520
The wind blows in the night

713
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,520
The wind blows in the night

714
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,520
The memories are in my heart

715
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,520
If I'm destined to lose my face

716
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
I only think about you

717
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Your Highness.

718
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
I only think about you

719
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
All the memories are in my heart

720
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
I'm sorry.

721
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Your Highness is not like that.

722
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
How many times have we been separated

723
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
There's nowhere to escape from love and hate

724
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,520
But I can't see who I'm looking at

725
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,520
How can I run away from the path of life

726
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,520
I only have one eye left

727
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,520
You and I are dreaming

728
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,520
of being carried by the wind

729
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
The blood is mixed with the frost

730
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,520
There's nowhere to go

731
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,520
Who will change the fate of love

732
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,520
The road is long, the dawn is bright

733
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
I should be more bold

734
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,520
If I want to meet you and part with you

735
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Let's go.

736
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,520
Your Highness.

737
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
A Xin is back.

738
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
No.

739
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
A Xin is now called Ru Yi.

740
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
I will live in peace and harmony

741
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
as you wish.

742
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
You like to be lively.

743
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
The people in the forest are so small.

744
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Do you feel calm?

745
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Your Highness.

746
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
I feel like...

747
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
I really feel like...

748
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
I really feel like...

749
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
How long have you been here?

750
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Just a while.

751
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Aren't you afraid of being seen by others?

752
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
You went to chase after a man and made a scene.

753
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
The dark fire outside the temple was removed.

754
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
There's no one at all.

755
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
How did you know I was here?

756
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,520
I thought you'd come to see the Empress

757
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
after you've dealt with the guards.

758
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
So I came to wait for you.

759
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
Her Highness's forest is a little deserted.

760
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,520
There are only four guards in the forest.

761
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
His Majesty wrote so many poems to miss Her Highness.

762
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,520
But he's so attached to her.

763
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
He's the most loyal to His Majesty.

764
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,520
But you called for Her Highness.

765
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,520
She must be very happy to know that.

766
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Nianzhou.

767
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,520
You're also worried, right?

768
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Yes.

769
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
It's okay.

770
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
I'll accompany you.

771
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Okay.

772
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
Is it better?

773
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
Much better.

774
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
I used to be used to love.

775
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,520
But now I realize that when I'm down,

776
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,520
I'm not as lonely as when I'm with someone.

777
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Thank you.

778
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,520
The road ahead is long and winding.

779
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,520
The clouds are like frost.

780
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,520
The road ahead is long and winding.

781
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
I'm always alone in the city.

782
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,520
I thought I couldn't see the world.

783
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,520
But when I look back, I see the light.

784
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Can you tell me what happened?

785
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Please give me a little bit of light.

786
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,520
If the sky is clear, I'll be there.

787
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Actually, you didn't leave for long.

788
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,520
Andi allowed auntie to go to the tower to see His Majesty.

789
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:27,520
But His Majesty said that he would write me a blood test after he got the book.

790
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Although I've thought about it a long time ago,

791
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,520
when the truth happened,

792
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
I was a little disappointed.

793
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,520
The brothers of the Heavenly Dao fought for him.

794
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,520
For him, it's all natural.

795
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,520
The mountains are clear, the rivers are clear.

796
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,520
The rivers are clear.

797
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,520
Life and death are different.

798
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Who are you fighting for?

799
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,520
You are fighting for your own life.

800
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
You once fought for your own life.

801
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,520
You once fought for your own life.

802
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,520
The past is gone, the past is gone.

803
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,520
The sky is red, the spring breeze is blowing.

804
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,520
Who drinks a cup of snow, the blood turns into ashes.

805
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,520
Who sighs for a moment, the sky is scattered like water.

806
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,520
Looking back, the future is so beautiful.

807
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,520
The world is so beautiful.

808
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Who will stay with me for the rest of my life?

809
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Who is worried about the future?

810
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,520
Who is afraid that dreams will become a dream?

811
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
The wind is blowing.

812
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,520
Who is regretting the past?

813
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,520
Who is regretting the past?

814
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,520
Who is regretting the past?

815
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Who is regretting the past?

816
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,520
Who is regretting the past?

817
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Who is regretting the past?

818
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Who is regretting the past?

819
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,520
Who is regretting the past?

820
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Who is regretting the past?

821
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,520
Who is regretting the past?

822
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Who is regretting the past?

823
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Who is regretting the past?

824
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,520
Who is regretting the past?
