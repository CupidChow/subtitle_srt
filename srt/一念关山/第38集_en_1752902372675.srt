00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,340
home

00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,500
home

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,240
home

4
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
The Heavens are crazy

5
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
The Heavens are crazy

6
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

7
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

8
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

9
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

10
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

11
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

12
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

13
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

14
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

15
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
The sky is blue, the sky is blue

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
You only dare to threaten her with those despicable tricks

19
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Little girl, you don't deserve to be a man

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Even if I don't deserve it

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
I still don't regret it

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
The handle is here

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
You can tell who painted the yellow

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
This is where she is

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Do you not know?

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,040
This is the custom of the previous dynasty.

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
If the Northern Plains is defeated,

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,040
the people of the northern plains will have to read the letter of surrender

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
and enter the history book.

30
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,740
So many people died.

31
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,640
A victory

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,340
made the people so happy.

33
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,640
During the period of chaos,

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,740
such a victory

35
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,540
is not sure how many lives can be taken.

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,740
So,

37
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,140
even if we don't know when the next big war will come,

38
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,540
we can still live.

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,240
To them, it is already a blessing.

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Long live the Emperor!

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Long live the Emperor of the Western Kingdom!

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Long live the Emperor!

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Long live the Emperor of the Western Kingdom!

44
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,940
What is this?

45
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,240
Your Majesty,

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,940
this is the crown of Prince Zuo Xian.

47
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Your Majesty!

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Your Majesty!

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Your Majesty, hold on!

50
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Be careful!

51
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Hold on!

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Your Majesty,

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
I...

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
King of the Stars!

55
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,240
Your Majesty!

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Your Majesty!

57
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
All the guards of Tianqi,

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
follow me to the capital.

59
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Your Highness!

60
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
I didn't want my brother to return to the country.

61
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
But after he and your brother

62
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
fought against the enemy,

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
he has lost the faith of the righteous and the enemy.

64
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Now that my brother has passed away,

65
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
the country cannot be ruled without a king.

66
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
The court officials will surely appoint a new emperor.

67
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Zhang Song, the old fox,

68
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
will be the one to control the court.

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
He won't let me take over.

70
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Most likely, he will give me

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
a crime of murdering the late emperor.

72
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
So I can only accept the military orders.

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Otherwise,

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
I will not change my mind.

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Yes.

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Zhang Song?

77
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
King of the Stars,

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
as the regent,

79
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
you have committed a crime of murdering the late emperor.

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
You are not to be punished for this crime.

81
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I am not to be punished

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
for the late emperor's orders.

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I will not allow you to be a traitor

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
and commit a crime of murder.

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Go!

86
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Your Majesty,

87
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
my dear,

88
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
why don't we

89
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
keep her alive?

90
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
After all,

91
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Her Majesty is not yet born.

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Her Majesty has been gone for a month.

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Tonight,

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
the Blue Silver will be arranged.

95
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Tomorrow,

96
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
the court officials will hear about the emperor's death

97
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,240
and then know about the empress's childbirth.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
When Her Majesty is born again,

99
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
it will be good if the male is replaced.

100
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
If the female is raised,

101
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,240
I will replace her with the male from the royal family.

102
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
In this way,

103
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,240
we can't even mix the royal bloodline.

104
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
But don't blame me for being cruel.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Every time the throne is changed,

106
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I will not kill a few royal officials.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
These few months,

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
King of the Stars and I have been

109
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
on the political field for a long time.

110
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Do you think he can find me

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
after ascending the throne?

112
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Ji Yangzhou?

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Your Majesty,

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Prince Ying.

115
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Tell your men to stop.

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
The emperor's death is not a big deal.

117
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
It's not your job

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
to be a subject.

119
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Your Majesty,

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
I have to go.

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
I will not let you go.

122
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Your Majesty,

123
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
I will not let you go.

124
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Your Majesty,

125
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
I will not let you go.

126
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
I will not let you go.

127
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
I can't obey you.

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Your Majesty,

129
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,240
it's not the time to be soft-hearted.

130
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
I think so, too.

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
My dear!

132
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Yingkou!

133
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Wu!

134
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Father!

135
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
The other ladies and gentlemen

136
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
of Prime Minister Zhang

137
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
are also in the palace.

138
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Good.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Very good.

140
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Let them stop.

141
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Stop!

142
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Stop!

143
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Brother,

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I received the news

145
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
and asked my sister-in-law

146
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
to come out to lead the party.

147
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Your Majesty,

148
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
you are the prince

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
and the prime minister.

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
You are not concerned about the country

151
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
but are eager to serve the country.

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Do you think my family

153
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
is not a mess?

154
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
You are right.

155
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Go get them two suits of suits.

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I have your uncle, Marquis Yongping.

158
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Your Majesty,

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
what on earth do you want?

160
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Please be straightforward.

161
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
You came and went

162
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
to fight

163
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
the Empress?

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
If so,

165
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
I, the Empress, will summon the officials to the court

166
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
and let you all know in person.

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Hurry and return.

168
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,240
The Empress has arrived!

169
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Greetings, Empress.

170
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,240
The Empress has arrived!

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Your Excellency,

172
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
I have summoned you all to the palace today to discuss a matter.

173
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
His Majesty has broken the Northern Plains in the state of An

174
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
and has guarded the river.

175
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Unfortunately,

176
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,240
he was injured by the Northern Plains assassins.

177
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Four days ago,

178
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
he had died.

179
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
His Majesty is injured?

180
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
What happened?

181
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
But a few days ago,

182
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
didn't His Majesty just return from his journey?

183
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Why did he suddenly...

184
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Did he do something wrong?

185
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I dare not lie to you about such a big matter.

186
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Prime Minister Zhang and Prince of Danyang are all witnesses.

187
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
May Your Highness rest in peace.

188
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Please rise.

189
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Although I am heartbroken,

190
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I cannot let my own pain

191
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
ruin the great cause of our country.

192
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
The great cause of our country

193
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,240
is not to be involved with the Northern Plains.

194
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I have a few words to ask Prince of Danyang.

195
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,240
What should we do with the war in the future?

196
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Although the Northern Plains' former king died,

197
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
the Wolf Lord will not give up.

198
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
The situation will only get more fierce.

199
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
If the river is broken,

200
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
both countries will have a great war.

201
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
So I think

202
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,240
we should send more troops

203
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
to reinforce the river

204
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
so that we can defeat His Majesty

205
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
and stop the bloodshed.

206
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I think the mountain is about to collapse.

207
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,240
The Great Five Eagle Pond is in a critical situation.

208
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Although the Northern Plains are in a critical situation,

209
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
they will return to the Anguo County

210
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
which is more important than the palace

211
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
and return to the source.

212
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
We should use our remaining forces

213
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
to make the long-term plan.

214
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Nonsense!

215
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
The alliance between the five states and the Great An

216
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
is just established.

217
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
How can we betray it?

218
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
There is only interest between the two states.

219
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
There is no moral.

220
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
If the Anguo people keep their promise,

221
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
why after we pay the ransom,

222
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
they still put His Majesty and Prince Li

223
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
in the Anguo for several days?

224
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Princess Li Cheng,

225
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
if the alliance can be changed at will,

226
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
how can you let the Aying,

227
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
who just became the Qing's Lady,

228
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
to be the Crown Prince of the Great An?

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Why do you think the Northern Plains

230
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
will only attack the Anguo

231
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
and not the Great Five?

232
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Prime Minister, the Northern Plains people

233
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
have been defeated

234
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
by the Iron Pond.

235
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
I only know that

236
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
war requires military resources.

237
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
The military expenses spent by Tianmen Pass

238
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
plus the 100,000 taels of gold

239
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
that were returned to His Majesty

240
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
are too much.

241
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
If we send more troops,

242
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
the Ministry of Revenue will not be able to support us.

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
I understand

244
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
your thoughts.

245
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
The state is a family business.

246
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
His Majesty is no longer here.

247
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
The state cannot be without a king.

248
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
I am

249
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
willing to recommend the position of Prince Dan Yang.

250
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Your Highness, you cannot.

251
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
His Majesty was killed suddenly

252
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
and was heavily injured.

253
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
I have never doubted

254
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
that His Majesty was killed

255
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
by Prince Dan Yang.

256
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
But I know that

257
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
the court sent a group of people

258
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
to support His Majesty's 5000 soldiers.

259
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
The general who led the group

260
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
is Prince Dan Yang's trusted aide.

261
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
If Prince Dan Yang

262
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
wants to do something to His Majesty,

263
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
why wait until the Northern Plains

264
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
is destroyed?

265
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
There is no better time

266
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
than now.

267
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
The Emperor's edict

268
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
is that the Northern Plains

269
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
is not divided by the old and the new.

270
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
It is a death-worshipping plan.

271
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Prime Minister Zhang,

272
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
His Majesty

273
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
died of bloodshed

274
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
because of the Northern Plains.

275
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Princess Li Cheng

276
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
married Duke of Qing

277
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
to fulfill the two-state treaty.

278
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Do you know

279
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
that it is as bad as my death?

280
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
I am sorry.

281
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I do not dare.

282
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
To be honest,

283
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
no one in this world

284
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
wants to let Prince Dan Yang

285
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
take the throne more than I do.

286
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
But I know better

287
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
that the Northern Plains is at the front.

288
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Prince Chun is cold and

289
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
will retreat if he does not want to.

290
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
I am grateful for your success.

291
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I hope that the ancestors will be

292
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
of good health and the country will be prosperous.

293
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Your Highness is wise and righteous.

294
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
We will respect your kindness.

295
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Prince Dan Yang,

296
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
can you make a vow before the ancestral temple

297
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
that you will treat us well?

298
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
We will not kill or beg.

299
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
We will keep our people safe.

300
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
We will use the old ministers

301
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
as we used to do

302
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
and will not regret our old vows.

303
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
We will betray

304
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
and restore the peace of the Central Plains.

305
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I am willing to die

306
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
of bloodshed.

307
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
I will take the throne

308
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
and fight for the throne.

309
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I will not be a traitor.

310
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
During this time,

311
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
all the state affairs will be up to the Empress.

312
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Prime Minister Zhang.

313
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Prime Minister Zhang, how is His Majesty?

314
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
I am willing to follow my sister-in-law

315
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
with the other royal families

316
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
and take the throne.

317
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
The situation is very urgent.

318
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
We cannot ignore it.

319
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Because my sister-in-law is wise

320
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
and righteous,

321
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
we must be careful of the situation

322
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
of the Great Qing Empire.

323
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
I am willing to take the throne

324
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
and fight for the throne.

325
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
I am willing to take the throne

326
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
and fight for the throne.

327
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
I am willing to take the throne

328
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
and fight for the throne.

329
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
I am willing to take the throne

330
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
and fight for the throne.

331
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
During this time,

332
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
you can change your position

333
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
and send troops to the front.

334
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
I will do it.

335
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Yes.

336
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
In this case,

337
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
I ask you to go to the temple

338
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
and perform the rites.

339
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Come.

340
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I also don't know

341
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
whether Fangcai's choice is right or not.

342
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
However,

343
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
since you said,

344
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,240
I can only bet on her and Dawu's future.

345
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I hope that the new emperor can let us go

346
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,240
for the sake of my hard work.

347
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Your Highness, you are wise and wise.

348
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,240
If His Majesty has the will of heaven...

349
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Your Highness.

350
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Your Highness.

351
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Your Highness.

352
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Blood.

353
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
I felt something was wrong in the court just now.

354
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Hurry and call for a doctor.

355
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I must keep this child safe.

356
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Your Highness.

357
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Your Highness.

358
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
His Majesty is really a loving person.

359
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Yes, he is not bad in terms of politics.

360
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Prime Minister, now that things have come to this,

361
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
you should be happy.

362
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,240
His Majesty has already made a vow to heaven.

363
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,240
You will be able to keep your promise.

364
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Your Highness.

365
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Your Highness,

366
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
the 11th generation heir of the Yang family, Yang Xingjian,

367
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,240
has been recommended by the public.

368
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
State Liancheng

369
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Come in!

370
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Snake!

371
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Accumulate euthanasia to your husband.

372
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Attendants! Attendants!

373
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Please call for the doctor!

374
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,000
But it's okay.

375
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,480
He's afraid of being hit by a bomb.

376
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,880
Hurry up.

377
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
Send him to the hospital.

378
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,080
Hurry up.

379
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,120
Send him to the Danyang Mansion.

380
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,720
No.

381
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,680
If it weren't for the arrival of sister-in-law and me,

382
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,960
you would have wanted to kill him

383
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,000
in front of my second brother's mansion.

384
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,880
You were against his position

385
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
in the court just now.

386
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,160
I can't give you Hongxun.

387
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,320
Send him to my mansion.

388
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,600
I want to find my second brother in person.

389
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,640
Wait.

390
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Prime Minister.

391
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,040
His Majesty's life is uncertain.

392
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,760
You may have a chance to die.

393
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,320
What are you waiting for?

394
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,120
Hurry up.

395
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,040
Hurry up.

396
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,880
Hurry up.

397
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,360
Your Highness.

398
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Thank you for waiting outside.

399
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
My brother's condition is stable now.

400
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,520
But he's still unconscious.

401
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,920
Your Highness.

402
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,400
How is sister-in-law?

403
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,360
She went into the house

404
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,600
four hours ago.

405
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
But there's no news yet.

406
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,480
It means it's hard to get pregnant.

407
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,080
We want to go in.

408
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,400
But Lord Yulin said

409
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,920
that we can't enter the palace

410
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,880
because of the empress's order.

411
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
Yes.

412
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,200
I'll do it.

413
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,240
Your Highness.

414
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
How dare you!

415
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,880
Sister-in-law is in the palace.

416
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,360
As the imperial edict,

417
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,960
I have the responsibility to supervise the operation.

418
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,800
What?

419
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,720
Don't you believe

420
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
the state of the Wu Dynasty?

421
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,720
Your Highness, please.

422
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,040
Please wait.

423
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll send the eunuch

424
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
to inform you as soon as I get news.

425
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

426
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
What's going on?

427
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,320
Why don't you prepare

428
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,600
some food for the imperial guards?

429
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,120
Yes.

430
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,320
Go and prepare.

431
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,440
Yes.

432
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Lord Yulin is here.

433
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
He's like a star in the sky.

434
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,920
It's lucky that Lord Yulin is here.

435
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,480
But

436
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,440
from the late emperor to the emperor

437
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,120
and the empress,

438
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,360
they all died.

439
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,560
Is it possible that

440
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,800
the heaven will destroy our Wu Dynasty?

441
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,320
Well done.

442
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,760
You're really a good man.

443
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,920
I won't let you down.

444
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,080
Thank you.

445
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Your Highness, you're not strong enough.

446
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,680
You have to work harder.

447
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,520
Harder. Harder.

448
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,520
Your Highness.

449
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,320
Your feet are coming out.

450
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
Your Highness, hang in there.

451
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,720
It's the sound of the knife.

452
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,360
The knife.

453
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,480
Your Highness, hang in there.

454
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
Your Highness, it'll be fine soon.

455
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,120
Your Highness, you're bleeding.

456
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,440
Your Highness,

457
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,000
you have to hang in there.

458
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,960
Hang in there. Hang in there.

459
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Your Highness, it'll be fine soon.

460
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,240
Your Highness, how is it?

461
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,880
Just as you wished.

462
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,000
Your Highness, are you unwell?

463
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,840
I have a body.

464
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,640
Have a sip.

465
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,760
I'm not in good health.

466
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
I always carry this around.

467
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,720
Your Highness, have a sip.

468
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,560
Your Highness, you're going to pass out.

469
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,040
Your Highness, wake up.

470
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Your Highness.

471
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,680
Your Highness.

472
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,720
This is so cold.

473
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,000
Your Highness.

474
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,320
Are you sure you can't get a fever?

475
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,520
Yes.

476
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Your Highness,

477
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,640
hang in there.

478
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,240
I'm right outside.

479
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,200
But if you fail,

480
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,440
you'll be the one to lose your country.

481
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,680
Your Highness,

482
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,280
Her Highness just woke up.

483
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm afraid she's back to her senses.

484
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,080
I'm afraid she has a message for you.

485
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,720
Your Highness.

486
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,960
Your Highness, wake up.

487
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Your Highness.

488
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,200
As a princess,

489
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm so happy to be alive.

490
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Your Highness.

491
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,520
Why are you crying?

492
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,840
It's my bad luck.

493
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Xing Yan.

494
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,440
Sister Yan, please don't blame me.

495
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Come here.

496
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,240
I have something to tell you.

497
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,080
You may all leave.

498
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Yes.

499
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,880
I hope you can last a bit longer.

500
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,080
Sister Yan.

501
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,920
What can we say about this lovely dinner?

502
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Is there anything beyond your control?

503
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,020
Hello?

504
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,540
I drink

505
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,420
wow

506
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Why do you ask?

507
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,420
Why?

508
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
All these years,

509
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,420
we've treated you well.

510
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420
Well?

511
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,420
But I don't care about your life at all.

512
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
In terms of my birth,

513
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
my mother's identity is the most dangerous.

514
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
In terms of talent,

515
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,420
I'm stronger than my mother.

516
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,420
But I don't care about your life.

517
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
I'm ten times stronger than my two brothers.

518
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,420
But because I was kind at eight years old,

519
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,420
I wanted to save you from the water of Longzhou.

520
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
You were in a miserable life,

521
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
and you had no connection with the throne for your whole life.

522
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,420
You owe me a life.

523
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,420
But why did you choose to give up the humble Prince Dan Yan,

524
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,420
who never thought of me?

525
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,420
You deserve this.

526
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,420
Repay.

527
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,420
It's all a retribution.

528
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,420
So,

529
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,420
His Majesty's death

530
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
is also your hand.

531
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Of course.

532
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
You didn't expect it, did you?

533
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
When Gu Sao set out on Yang Yin,

534
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
you started to plan.

535
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,420
I found out that

536
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
the previous move was very powerful.

537
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,420
I told him

538
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
that he couldn't let the emperor

539
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,420
who had made a great mistake come back to Wudu.

540
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,420
But it's a pity.

541
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,420
I don't know what happened on the way to the previous move.

542
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,420
I couldn't let him die in Hexian,

543
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,420
but let him live for almost a month.

544
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,420
But

545
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
it's not difficult for the left emperor

546
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
who gave the gun to Yi Xin

547
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
to avenge the people of the Yuan Army

548
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,420
in the last battle.

549
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
You did this

550
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,420
to the people of Da Wu

551
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,420
and the people of the world?

552
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,420
It's Da Wu who did this to me!

553
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
I don't care about that.

554
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,420
I just want to be the king of Da Wu.

555
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,420
As long as you all die,

556
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,420
the officials will only have to support me.

557
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,420
Didn't you see how grateful they were to me just now?

558
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,420
You've been blocking me for so many years.

559
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
No one will suspect me!

560
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Really?

561
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,420
You!

562
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
Did you all hear

563
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
the confession of King Ying?

564
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Gu Cixu is wise.

565
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,420
I didn't expect to see a poisonous snake under the jade throne.

566
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Second Brother!

567
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
Don't kill me!

568
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
I was just being a little bit suspicious.

569
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
I just wanted to be like you

570
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
and experience the whole world.

571
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
I'm only 22 years old.

572
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
I'm not alive yet!

573
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,420
My hand slipped.

575
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
I know that you people from Wu State

576
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
are always nagging.

577
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Maybe

578
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,420
you want to go to Da Li Temple

579
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,420
in the Zongzheng Prefecture.

580
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,420
I, an outsider,

581
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
might as well be the bad guy for you.

582
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,420
Ji Deng,

583
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,420
King Ying suddenly died

584
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,420
and was buried in the palace.

585
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,420
No!

586
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,420
King Ying was a traitor

587
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
and I killed him myself!

588
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,420
He almost killed

589
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,420
my son and me

590
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,420
because he killed the late emperor.

591
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
You wanted to leave him the last bit of dignity.

592
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
But I had to

593
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
break him into pieces

594
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,420
so that he could be taken away from me.

595
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Your Majesty,

596
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,420
the late emperor passed away

597
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
and he gave me a will.

598
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
I'm sorry.

599
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
I failed

600
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
and I'm sorry.

601
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
The emperor Yang Xingjian

602
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,420
is a good demon.

603
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,420
He will be the first to ascend the throne

604
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,420
and the throne of the emperor.

605
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
I'm willing to work hard

606
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,420
to fight against the enemy

607
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,420
and not let my people down.

608
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,420
I'm hereby

609
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
to hand over the will.

610
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
Wait.

611
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
This is the emperor's handwriting!

612
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
Look at this!

613
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
There's even a seal!

614
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,420
duty

615
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Your lover is a bitch

616
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,420
you have deceived me.

617
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,920
I am willing to

618
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Ben andings of the late emperor

619
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
to have him die in service

620
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
and praise him forever.

621
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,240
Long live Your Majesty!

622
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,040
Rise.

623
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

624
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,920
I've known the people's opinion

625
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,040
since I was a prisoner.

626
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,440
I shall abide by the last order of the late emperor

627
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,920
to fight against the traitors with all our strength.

628
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,200
Send my order.

629
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,440
The King of Ying rebelled against Fuzhu

630
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,600
and was deported to the clan of Ge Chu.

631
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
All the wealth and wealth of the mansion

632
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,120
shall be returned to the military.

633
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

634
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,960
Your Majesty.

635
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,600
Six Taoist priests have escorted the Emperor of the Great Qing to the capital.

636
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
He has arrived in Lingzhou.

637
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,320
Please send my order to the Marquis of the Four Seas.

638
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

639
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,120
As for the seal,

640
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,200
I entrust it to the Empress.

641
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,440
You may stay in the palace for now.

642
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,360
If I go back to the capital,

643
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,520
I can save the military expenses

644
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,880
by burying the seal twice.

645
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,520
If I make any mistake,

646
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,640
the Empress will decide

647
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,520
who will be the Emperor.

648
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,320
Your Majesty, you can't do this.

649
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,600
It's a bad idea.

650
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,520
You don't have to say that.

651
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,600
The state affairs are getting worse.

652
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,920
It's my duty to explain this

653
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,080
before I go to war.

654
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,760
Besides,

655
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,960
I'd rather send the last order of the late emperor

656
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,080
to fight against the traitors with all our strength

657
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,840
and make great contributions to the country.

658
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,920
I, Jing Ning Yuanzhou, will be the Marquis of Jingyuan.

659
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,440
Ren Ruyi will be the wife of Ning.

660
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Thank you for your grace.

661
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,760
But I beg Your Majesty to take back your order.

662
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,520
Ruyi did it all because of her own choice,

663
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,840
not because of her status as a concubine.

664
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,120
That's right.

665
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,680
I and Yuanzhou came here day and night.

666
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,480
We didn't want to make any achievements.

667
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,000
We just wanted to be an ordinary citizen

668
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,160
and stop a conspiracy.

669
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,920
We wanted to do something for the peace of Central Plains.

670
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,560
Your Majesty,

671
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,720
since we set out from He County,

672
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,880
the Northern Pan's commander has made a new plan

673
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,920
and ordered them to continue attacking Central Plains.

674
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,000
They killed the West King and died in battle.

675
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,760
They killed the Central Plains and rebelled halfway.

676
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,640
Li Pongguang, Duke of Qing, lost his troops and fell.

677
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,800
Three days ago, they just arrived at the meeting with the people of He County.

678
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,160
The people of He County also died.

679
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,120
Now,

680
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,760
I beg Your Majesty to send troops as soon as possible

681
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,440
to send He County to the water.

682
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,880
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

683
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,680
There is a brotherly alliance before Wu'an.

684
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,080
There will be a marriage alliance after that.

685
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,280
I will lead the army to fight against the enemy

686
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,000
by the army of each department.

687
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,440
Yes.

688
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,480
During this period,

689
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
the state affairs

690
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,680
will be entrusted to the Empress and Prime Minister.

691
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,280
Yes.

692
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,680
Your Majesty, you are right.

693
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,440
The two countries are in the best position.

694
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,000
I hope Your Majesty can eliminate the disaster of Central Plains as soon as possible

695
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,760
to avoid the suffering of the people.

696
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,120
I will follow you until my death.

697
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,560
I will follow you until my death.

698
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,840
I will leave as soon as possible.

699
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,800
I will meet with the soldiers of He County as soon as possible.

700
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,280
Besides,

701
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
I want to take some old men of Liu Datang

702
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,240
to go with me.

703
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,800
Prime Minister Zhang.

704
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,440
Your Majesty.

705
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,080
The soldiers are in good health.

706
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,840
Please take this military uniform

707
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,280
and hurry to He County.

708
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Take the reinforcements to reinforce the State of An.

709
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

710
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,480
Please tell the Duke of Qin

711
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,720
that I will lead 20,000 troops to support him

712
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,120
within five days.

713
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

714
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,600
Duke of Qin,

715
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,680
please let me speak to you.

716
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,680
Okay.

717
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,480
I will wait for you here.

718
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,960
Okay.

719
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,000
A group of exiled prisoners

720
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,360
I think

721
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,760
you don't need them anymore.

722
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,960
It's better than nothing.

723
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,720
But, my dear,

724
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm sorry

725
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,360
for not doing what you asked me to do.

726
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,040
I'm sorry.

727
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,320
You saved my life

728
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,800
from the King of Ying.

729
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,160
Why do you say that?

730
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,480
But,

731
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,680
I just want to know one thing.

732
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,400
Is the late emperor's will

733
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
true?

734
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,920
It's best that

735
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,320
it doesn't.

736
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,280
Okay.

737
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:47,700
Nowadays, there is still another way to save lives.

738
00:40:47,700 --> 00:41:10,700
I have two wills, one for King Dan Yaowen, and one for the prince who was not born.

739
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:17,700
Who will you give the crown to?

740
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Yuan Luo, Sun Lang, Qian Zhao, and the late emperor died for the purpose of fighting against the North Korean.

741
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Including Yang Yang, he also took the initiative to make a name for himself for the cause of the two countries' anti-enemy.

742
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Yuan Luo, Sun Lang, and the late emperor died for the purpose of fighting against the North Korean.

743
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:40,700
Yuan Luo, Sun Lang, and the late emperor died for the purpose of fighting against the North Korean.

744
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:15,700
After the order of the ship was taken back to the capital, the final decision was made after knowing the dispute between the Prime Minister and King Dan Yaowen in the court.

745
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:27,700
So that's how it is.

746
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:37,700
So that's how it is.

747
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:43,700
I was born to be a military soldier.

748
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:51,700
I didn't expect to lose at the last moment.

749
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,700
Forget it. Let's get down to business.

750
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Although you only have him, you may not only be able to move Yuan Luo and the other soldiers.

751
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,700
