5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sister Ruyi

7
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Good, very good

8
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sister Ruyi

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ruyi, your highness

10
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't come over

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Go

12
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Chase

13
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Sister Ruyi

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sister Ruyi, don't sleep

15
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My mother also left when she fell asleep

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm not dead yet

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Great

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have some medicine for the wound

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Qingyu Sai saved my life when he left

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why don't you run away?

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Aren't you afraid of death?

22
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because I believe you won't kill me

23
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why?

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm the best killer in Zhu Yiwei

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But you are also my master

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sister Ruyi

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sister Ruyi

28
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You are not dead yet

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You are not dead yet

30
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You should go

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sister Ruyi

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sister Ruyi

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sister Ruyi

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sister Ruyi

35
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,620
Have a seat.

36
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,120
Your Highness...

37
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,300
Many Aretes pick a patternedgeting OP.

38
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,200
But you don't like it...

39
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
His Majesty and Her Highness have all sent people to visit.

40
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,400
They want to know when you will meet with Marquis Changxin.

41
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

42
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,600
Let's go and report to them a few days later.

43
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,160
I have something to do. You can go back first.

44
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Let's go.

45
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Let's go.

46
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,160
Who is this young lady?

47
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,760
You finally came.

48
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
What happened?

49
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
I have a fight with Meiren.

50
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,960
She was injured and took Her Highness away.

51
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
I think the situation is not right, so I made a fuss.

52
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
They said that the bandits took Her Highness away.

53
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
They sent people to inform you.

54
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
You also got hurt except them two.

55
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
She is the Imperial Guard.

56
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,560
Brother Qian deliberately made us leave.

57
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,960
They have been leaving us.

58
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
This is not entirely your fault.

59
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
But the priority is to find them.

60
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Wait.

61
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,760
Someone is coming.

62
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Let's go.

63
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Your Highness.

64
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Your Highness.

65
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Your Highness.

66
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Your Highness.

67
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Manager Yuan.

68
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,960
It's not me. It's Ru Yi.

69
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
She is badly injured.

70
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
She is dying soon.

71
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,360
Hurry and save her. Hurry.

72
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Okay. Don't worry.

73
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,760
Zhizi, send her back.

74
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Okay.

75
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,960
Bring the horse here.

76
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
If you want to save her, you have to chase me to death.

77
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,360
Your Highness.

78
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Your Highness.

79
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Your Highness.

80
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Save me.

81
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
How do you want me to save you?

82
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
You are badly injured.

83
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Both of your meridians are broken.

84
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,760
I will come back to you, Your Highness.

85
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
You forgot all my orders.

86
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,160
I told you not to fall in love with men.

87
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,760
You forgot everything.

88
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
I will come back to you.

89
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
I will come back to you.

90
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
If a killer falls in love with a man, it's a big mistake.

91
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,760
If he does something wrong, he will only die.

92
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,760
This time, even I can't save you.

93
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Your Highness.

94
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Don't go.

95
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I told you I must save...

96
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
You were put in the shadow of the cloud. But we didn't.

97
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Letting her die outside is already my kindness to her.

98
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
She never thought of hiding her identity.

99
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
I was the one who took the initiative to find her.

100
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
So you knew she was Zhu Yiwei.

101
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You knew she was Zhu Yiwei.

102
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
You knew she was Zhu Yiwei.

103
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
You knew she was Zhu Yiwei.

104
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
You knew she was Zhu Yiwei.

105
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
You knew she was Zhu Yiwei.

106
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
You knew she was Zhu Yiwei.

107
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I knew it.

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
She was indeed the former leader of Zhu Yiwei.

109
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
But if she wanted to hurt us, she would have done it long ago.

110
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Why did she have to wait until now?

111
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
And she had already betrayed Zhu Yiwei.

112
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Then she could have betrayed us again.

113
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
She wouldn't.

114
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Why do you say that?

115
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Because of my life.

116
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Did you all forget?

117
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Who was fighting with us in the Sky Castle?

118
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Is there such a stupid spy in the Sky Castle?

119
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
So,

120
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
no matter how much I trust you,

121
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
I trust her.

122
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
I will save her no matter what.

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
If you want to stop me,

124
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
I will die.

125
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Boss, the spy.

126
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Boss, the spy.

127
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Boss, the spy.

128
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Boss, the spy.

129
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Boss, the spy.

130
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Boss, the spy.

131
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Boss, the spy.

132
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Boss, the spy.

133
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Boss, the spy.

134
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Boss, the spy.

135
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Boss, the spy.

136
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Boss, the spy.

137
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Boss, the spy.

138
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Boss, the spy.

139
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Boss, the spy.

140
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Boss, the spy.

141
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Boss, the spy.

142
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Boss, the spy.

143
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Boss, the spy.

144
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Boss, the spy.

145
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Boss, the spy.

146
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Boss, the spy.

147
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Boss, the spy.

148
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Boss, the spy.

149
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Boss, the spy.

150
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Boss, the spy.

151
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Boss, the spy.

152
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Boss, the spy.

153
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Boss, the spy.

154
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Boss, the spy.

155
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Boss, the spy.

156
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Boss, the spy.

157
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Boss, the spy.

158
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Boss, the spy.

159
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Boss, the spy.

160
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Boss, the spy.

161
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Boss, the spy.

162
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Boss, the spy.

163
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Boss, the spy.

164
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Boss, the spy.

165
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Boss, the spy.

166
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Boss, the spy.

167
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Boss, the spy.

168
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Boss, the spy.

169
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Boss, the spy.

170
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Huong!

171
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Ru Yi!

172
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Ru Yi!

173
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
You're awake.

174
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Don't move.

175
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Once you hit him, you'll die.

176
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
I'd rather die.

177
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Don't worry.

178
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
It's just a sudden break-up.

179
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
The energy is back.

180
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
It's okay.

181
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Come on.

182
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Stop acting.

183
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
You and Yu Shi San told me

184
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
on purpose, didn't you?

185
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
You're lying to me.

186
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
You're using me.

187
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
I trust you without any guard.

188
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
What companion?

189
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
What trust?

190
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
It's all fake.

191
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
I trust you.

192
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
I know you came to Zhu Yi Wei

193
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
to find out the real murderer of Ling Long.

194
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Qin Zhao and others just misunderstood you.

195
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
But I trust you.

196
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
I really trust you.

197
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
I don't need your trust.

198
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Ru Yi, listen to me.

199
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Calm down.

200
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I'll...

201
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm calm.

202
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I...

203
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
You!

204
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I'll kill you if you come any closer.

205
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Okay.

206
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
You kill him.

207
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
If you don't believe me,

208
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
just kill me.

209
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
I said

210
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
you're my companion.

211
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I'll die for you.

212
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I don't regret it.

213
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Come on.

214
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
From here.

215
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Come on.

216
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Go up and take a photo.

217
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Go down.

218
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Okay.

219
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
Come on, kill me!

220
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,120
But today, no matter what,

221
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,240
whether you kill me or not,

222
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,160
I will save you.

223
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,240
Don't come over, you're crazy!

224
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,560
I'm crazy!

225
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,240
I saw you hurt yourself,

226
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,320
I'm already crazy!

227
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,040
You really think I don't dare?

228
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,440
I didn't think anything.

229
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,560
I just want to save you.

230
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,760
I died in your hands.

231
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
I have no regrets.

232
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
You are indeed the best killer of Zhu Yi Bei.

233
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,880
You try to avoid roads or shutters to avoid analogs.

234
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
You're very sharp-witted.

235
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I bet you can't bear it.

236
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Ruyi.

237
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Ruyi.

238
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
I'll treat you.

239
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
It's useless.

240
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I mean internal injury.

241
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Listen to me.

242
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Let me try.

243
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
What are you doing?

244
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Don't move.

245
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Once it's too heavy,

246
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
we'll go kill it with two hundred.

247
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
I'll lose half of my internal energy to you.

248
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
No need.

249
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
I'll go with you.

250
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
I'll go with you.

251
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
I'll go with you.

252
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
I'll go with you.

253
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
I'll go with you.

254
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
No need.

255
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Even if you save me,

256
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
I won't go back with you.

257
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
I know.

258
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
I know you've suffered a lot.

259
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
I know you won't go back to the city.

260
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
But I just want to save you.

261
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
I also know

262
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
we may never meet again.

263
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
I still hope you

264
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
can live happily.

265
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Find a man

266
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
who deserves your love.

267
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Find a man who belongs to you.

268
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Go.

269
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I'll send you to a new place.

270
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Continue to live happily for me.

271
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
In this life,

272
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
don't fall in love with men easily.

273
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
But

274
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
there must be someone

275
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
who is our own child.

276
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Shi San and others

277
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
must think I'm crazy.

278
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
But I'm not the leader of Liu De Tang now.

279
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm just Ning Yuan Zhou.

280
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
I'm not the leader of Liu De Tang.

281
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
I'm just Ning Yuan Zhou.

282
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Don't be sad.

283
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm just too hurt.

284
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
I know.

285
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Fool.

286
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
I'm not talking about you.

287
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
I'm talking about myself.

288
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
I know that too.

289
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
It smells so good.

290
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
I can smell it even from the side of the pond.

291
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Lihua Shao is a specialty of Yuzhou.

292
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
His Majesty will summon me this morning.

293
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I guess he's cold enough to let me take the army.

294
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
I'll bring him a good wine.

295
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,320
It's also a way to help me get closer to the dream of the paper fan.

296
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
These people are not right.

297
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Be careful.

298
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Stop.

299
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm here to drink.

300
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
It's your turn to talk about our private life.

301
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Get him.

302
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
These people are obviously prepared to come.

303
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Then there's no need to be so cruel.

304
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Retreat.

305
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Who taught you that?

306
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Stop talking.

307
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Use your skills to persuade them.

308
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Yes.

309
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Wushu, Wushu.

310
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
It's the princess Jinmin who sent us here.

311
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
It's really her.

312
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
What's your grudge against Jinmin?

313
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Last year, I dressed up as a civilian of the Sand Department to please His Majesty.

314
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
I stole her hairpin from the Three-horse Society.

315
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,320
A few days ago, I punished the people of the Sand Department.

316
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
How do you deal with them?

317
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Tie him up first.

318
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Send him to my account.

319
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Yes.

320
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Where are we going?

321
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I'll sell you a coffin first.

322
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
You'll know it later.

323
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

324
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Tong Guang, you're here just in time.

325
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
This is the niece of the Imperial Concubine.

326
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
She's the daughter of Duke Chu.

327
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
Her name is Chu Yue.

328
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
She's also your distant cousin.

329
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
The sun is good today.

330
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Do you want to ride a horse together?

331
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Cousin?

332
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I didn't see it.

333
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Your Majesty, please allow me to leave.

334
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Yue, don't take it to heart.

335
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
She's just like that.

336
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
She?

337
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
She doesn't deserve to be taken to heart.

338
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
What do you think of her looks?

339
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
She's so beautiful.

340
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Are you two having some misunderstanding?

341
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
It's not a misunderstanding.

342
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
It's a misunderstanding.

343
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Let's go.

344
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Wait.

345
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
The Imperial Concubine asked me to take you this way

346
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
to let you two meet each other first.

347
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Why did you two have some misunderstanding?

348
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Why should I meet her first?

349
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Aren't you two engaged?

350
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Isn't she a member of the Imperial Guard?

351
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,320
The one His Majesty said he would grant me a marriage with is Marquis Chang Qing.

352
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,320
The title His Majesty gave Tong Guang is Marquis Chang Qing.

353
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
A marriage?

354
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Why? You don't agree?

355
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
I don't dare.

356
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
I just have a little accident.

357
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,320
After all, a noble daughter like Lady Jin Ming

358
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
can even be the Crown Princess.

359
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
How can she look down on me?

360
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
I don't dare to marry her.

361
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
How can she look down on me?

362
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
I know you're rich.

363
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,320
That's why I've made you a rich and powerful family.

364
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Lady Jin Ming?

365
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
But didn't she just tell you to...

366
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
It's all nonsense.

367
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Life is not important.

368
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
But...

369
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,320
She wants to kill me and me only.

370
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,320
It's good for me to be the son-in-law of the Duke of Chu.

371
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,320
It seems that the old man is thinking of using me again.

372
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
That's why he's so angry.

373
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,320
He wants to fight again after getting the 100,000 taels of gold from Wu State.

374
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Our Emperor likes to fight against the enemy.

375
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Isn't it good for His Majesty to have a military power?

376
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,320
There are many places where the people are tired of the battle at Tianmen Pass.

377
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
The old man wants to attack other countries.

378
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,320
The people of Bianchui will be dragged into trouble again.

379
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Congratulations, Marquis Cheng.

380
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,320
From now on, we're a family.

381
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,320
You must be very satisfied with this marriage.

382
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
I'm very happy.

383
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
You're right.

384
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,320
I'm grateful to His Majesty for his grace.

385
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
I'm grateful to you.

386
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm sorry.

389
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm sorry.

391
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm sorry.

392
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm sorry.

393
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm sorry.

394
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I'm sorry.

395
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
I'm sorry.

399
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
I'm sorry.

400
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
I'm sorry.

401
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
I'm sorry.

402
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
I'm sorry.

404
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
I'm sorry.

406
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I'm sorry.

407
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
I'm sorry.

409
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm sorry.

410
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
I'm sorry.

411
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I'm sorry.

413
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I'm sorry.

414
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm sorry.

415
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm sorry.

419
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm sorry.

420
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm sorry.

421
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
I'm sorry.

422
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
I'm sorry.

423
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
I'm sorry.

425
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I'm sorry.

426
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
I'm sorry.

427
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
I'm sorry.

429
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
I'm sorry.

431
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
I'm sorry.

433
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
I'm sorry.

434
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,320
I'm sorry, Wall.

435
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
I'm sorry.

436
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
I'm sorry.

437
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
I'm sorry, Wall.

438
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
I'm sorry.

439
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,320
This is my fault.

440
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I changed my mind again.

441
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
I changed my mind?

442
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,760
As Shunni stopped you from stepping out of city.

443
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,700
Could you not support her completely?

444
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,200
You could kill Sunni,

445
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,180
married her immediately,

446
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,380
and try to help me out.

447
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,560
Tell me when can talk about her.

448
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,000
You should stay in that room,

449
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,740
don't pay attention to what I talk.

450
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
Tell me when can talk about her.

451
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,460
Hurry up!

452
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,880
Please!

453
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,780
Please take good care of us.

454
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,360
It's ok.

455
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,140
You tell me now.

456
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
Is that bad OK?

457
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,560
You are here!

458
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,860
Yes, your highness.

459
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,960
But I have some more important things.

460
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
I have to surrender to you.

461
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,140
Tell me.

462
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,620
You better be yours.

463
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
I'm sorry

464
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,380
He is still alive

465
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,500
Ning

466
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,660
I have never disobeyed your task

467
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,420
But this time

468
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,180
I don't understand you

469
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,740
You didn't say anything, I didn't say anything

470
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,880
Give me an explanation

471
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,600
Then I will tell you

472
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,640
Tell me

473
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,680
We need to do some research

474
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,580
What is the book you use for?

475
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,760
For this question

476
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,440
You and I

477
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,880
He does have a few lives of the six Taoist churches.

478
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,000
But they are all Zhao Ji's trusted party.

479
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,680
He has no grudge against all the people in our mission.

480
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,040
Whether the six Taoist churches or the Zhu Yi Wei,

481
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,160
we are all tools of those who have power.

482
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Many things can't be followed by our nature.

483
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,480
You should all understand.

484
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,840
Fourth,

485
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,280
the Zhu Yi Wei he disguised as Tian Ji's branch

486
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
is just to find out where his enemy is.

487
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
He didn't sell any secrets of the mission.

488
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,880
He used to be Zhu Yi Wei.

489
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,040
Now he is half Zhu Yi Wei.

490
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,040
It's fine if you don't have grudge against us.

491
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,720
Zun Lang's father,

492
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,600
Chai Ming,

493
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,840
and the brothers who were cut off before,

494
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,480
how many of them died in Angolan's hands?

495
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,840
Have you calculated it?

496
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,040
He is not from Angolan.

497
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,960
He was also sold to Zhu Yi Wei.

498
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
He was not allowed to enter.

499
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:42,300
The owners of the

500
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,800
Zhu Yi Wei are the lives of the swordsmen.

501
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Didn't we kill Zhu Yi Wei?

502
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,960
Zhu Yi Wei stole military money.

503
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,560
There are more than ten thousand soldiers

504
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,760
who are the lives of the bandits.

505
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,800
The one who killed their master,

506
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,280
isn't it Hu Tai Jian who sold the military money?

507
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,400
If it wasn't for His Majesty's careful advice,

508
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,080
how could he end up like this?

509
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,400
You actually doubt His Majesty for him?

510
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,560
That's right.

511
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,240
I'm from the Sixth Patriarchate.

512
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,320
I'm the leader of His Majesty.

513
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,160
But in my heart,

514
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,040
the people, brothers, and companions

515
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,800
are more important than his life.

516
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Moreover, all of these have nothing to do with Ruyi.

517
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,560
You were possessed by the mysterious soul of Ren Shu Yi.

518
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,840
You even forgot where you were from.

519
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
I've been your brother for so many years.

520
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,440
I'd rather be a person who is possessed by someone.

521
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm not a person who doesn't care about right and wrong.

522
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,560
Tell me.

523
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,080
Am I?

524
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
If he really wanted to harm us,

525
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,960
he could have done it long ago.

526
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,640
Qian Zhao.

527
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,360
Have you forgotten that he saved you and all of us in the Sky Castle?

528
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,960
Sun Lang.

529
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,280
When we were in the dark,

530
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,200
who brought His Majesty back?

531
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,200
Shen San.

532
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,000
Who accompanied you to the Green Mirror Mountain

533
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
to catch the poisonous snake and save Yuan Lu?

534
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,480
So can you tell me

535
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,640
why I can't save him

536
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,840
if he used his life to help Shi Tuo?

537
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,200
Why can't I help him?

538
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,800
Because he's a person who doesn't trust others.

539
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,680
But because of you,

540
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,720
because of you,

541
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,680
because of you,

542
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,160
he's willing to trust you and treat you as his companions.

543
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,600
But you want to kill him.

544
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,160
Do you know how sad and painful he is?

545
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,080
Is this what we, the people of the Six Halls, should do?

546
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,760
Is it?

547
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,680
Gosh.

548
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,960
At that time,

549
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,880
I didn't know there was such a mysterious Contract.

550
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,080
Yes, well...

551
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,840
piano

552
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,280
Master Du.

553
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm going to see him.

554
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,240
I thought he left the heaven early

555
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
He had no deep feelings with everyone

556
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
He drank too much last night

557
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,240
I just knew that he always treated Chai Ming as his brother

558
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
But he is very thoughtful

559
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
He always has a dead face

560
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
He hides everything in his heart

561
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
He never tells others

562
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I know

563
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,240
I decided to go to Anguo to clear Chai Ming's name

564
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Give me some time

565
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
I believe he will understand

566
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,040
By the way, how did you deal with the Anguos in such a big battle yesterday?

567
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
Don't worry

568
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
People outside think that the bandits attacked the delegation

569
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Now, except for the business team

570
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Most of the delegation members don't know that the beauty is Zhu Yiwei's

571
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Governor Du went directly to Shentu City to cause trouble

572
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
He said he was the mastermind behind this time

573
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,040
His Highness Jiechi is trying to destroy the peace talks between the two countries

574
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Shentu City's attitude changed as soon as he heard it

575
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
He didn't just swear to be close to himself

576
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
He also sent people to serve him

577
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
Later, he said he would personally ask His Highness

578
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
At this moment

579
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Most of them are investigating the bandits in the house

580
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Ok

581
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Let them investigate

582
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,840
There must be a spy among the slaves sent by the Anguos

583
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Shisan

584
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,840
This is the human skin mask that Ru Yi used to meet Zhu Yiwei

585
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
You find a fake body

586
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Take this mask and send it to the flower market

587
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Ok

588
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Later, pretend to be your sister Ru Yi

589
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Go out for a walk

590
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,640
So the spy will think that the person who took the mask with him is dead

591
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Won't suspect Ru Yi's identity

592
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Yes

593
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
You say

594
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Can we still see the beauty?

595
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,640
She has three fatal wounds

596
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I used all my inner strength to protect her

597
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
What do you say?

598
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Sister Ru Yi must be having a hard time now

599
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Last time when we ate lamb together

600
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,640
She was so happy to dance with us

601
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
But now

602
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
I'll go see His Highness

603
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,640
I didn't sleep last night

604
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
I don't know where Sister Ru Yi is now

605
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Is there any better wound on her body?

606
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Mr. Du

607
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,640
In the future, if Sister Ru Yi is not here, what should I do?

608
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
I have to go to see the body

609
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,640
I'm really afraid of showing up

610
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
Your Highness

611
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
You have to have confidence in yourself

612
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
After such a big thing last night

613
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
You can't stand still

614
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,440
You should be more careful when you meet Shen Tu Chi

615
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
It's better

616
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Ok

617
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Your Highness

618
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
I have a request

619
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
I know you hate Shen Tu Chi

620
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
But when you see her

621
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
She has any hesitation

622
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
For example, the father's tears

623
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
As long as I don't object

624
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
You must promise her

625
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Why?

626
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,540
No

627
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,540
Just a good word

628
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
Good?

629
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,640
The relationship between two countries

630
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
It's not just in fact

631
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
But also in fact

632
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,600
Our army defeated with our Seeing

633
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
So we lost at that time

634
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Except with Shen Tu ChI

635
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
It's so lively

636
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
I understand.

637
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
I need to let the people of An to know that I'm not a soft egg.

638
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
In the future, maybe the mission will go smoothly.

639
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Your Highness is really smart.

640
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
To be honest,

641
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
when I just set out,

642
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,600
I was still suspicious of you when you were sent to the camp.

643
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
But along the way,

644
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
you are doing better and better.

645
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
You are indeed the son of the late emperor.

646
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Really?

647
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
How dare I say that?

648
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Your Highness,

649
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,600
it's really hard for you to find Miss Ren.

650
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
She is really a good actress.

651
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
But I didn't expect that

652
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Miss Ren is actually...

653
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I have something to tell you.

654
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm sorry.

655
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
I have something to tell you.

656
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
How come after you knew that

657
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Miss Ruyi is the daughter of Zhu Yiwei,

658
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
you are not as angry as Brother Qian and others?

659
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Instead, you are quite impressed with her.

660
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Because I have always remembered the words of the late emperor.

661
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
To judge a person,

662
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
don't look at where he comes from.

663
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
But look at what he says and does,

664
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
and what he can do for the people.

665
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Miss Ren has been working hard all the way for the group.

666
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
She doesn't care about life and death.

667
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
It's also because of this that

668
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,600
I believe she has a good intention for the group.

669
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Thank you for teaching me.

670
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,600
This was found in the yard.

671
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
When Ruyi was injured,

672
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
she said something in a daze.

673
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
But what she meant was

674
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
that this was for you.

675
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I heard from Shisan about you.

676
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
She should have

677
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
told me about this.

678
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
I'm sure she did.

679
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,600
She probably wanted to apologize to you with this.

680
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Did she hit me because she is Zhu Yiwei?

681
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
No.

682
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Because she respects the empress.

683
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,600
Their relationship

684
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
is like me and Yuan Lu.

685
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,600
I shouldn't have scolded the empress.

686
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Brother Ren,

687
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Mr. Du taught me a lot.

688
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
I understand a little.

689
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,600
But I still don't know

690
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,600
whose fault it is.

691
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Actually, no one is wrong.

692
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
It's just a joke.

693
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
But

694
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
as long as you remember that you are good to you,

695
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
that's enough.

696
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,780
Your

697
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Your Mama

698
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:22,380
Is

699
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:28,320
So now, if you can feel and take care of the quarrel,

700
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,060
you call theif and instigate the quar丈夫 in my heart slowly

701
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,460
the area will beationalized.

702
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:41,880
It just needs you to be vielleicht and understand,

703
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,820
and your Slow Th quarrel will be met with truth.

704
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,380
What if you do it yourself?

705
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,300
I'm not afraid.

706
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,500
I'll deal with the poison well.

707
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,300
Only in this way

708
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,700
can I live up to everything

709
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,100
that Ru Yi gave me.

710
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,780
And that rabbit.

711
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,780
Okay.

712
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,060
Go.

713
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,900
What's wrong with you?

714
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,300
I'm fine.

715
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,700
I'm exhausted.

716
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,220
It's just that Ru Yi's hand is a little injured.

717
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,500
It's much better to spit out the blood.

718
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,300
I'll go find Mr. Qian and get the medicine.

719
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,100
Hu Lan.

720
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,380
They are fighting against the Koreans ahead.

721
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,700
We can't be found.

722
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,780
But you...

723
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,500
I'm fine.

724
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Clean up the blood later.

725
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Don't let them worry.

726
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,700
Okay?

727
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,300
Okay.

728
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:43,900
Okay.

729
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,500
Okay.

730
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,100
Okay.

731
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:45,700
Okay.

732
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,300
Okay.

733
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:46,900
Okay.

734
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,500
Okay.

735
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,100
Okay.

736
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,620
Okay.

737
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,620
Don't worry.
