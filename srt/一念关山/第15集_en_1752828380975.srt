ALLY

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,640
Let me take everyone hands off

4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,020
Wait

5
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,500
for the Ext sitter

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:18,360
the

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:26,100
new

11
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
The letter from the jade wolf?

12
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,100
Liu's Manor is not far from here.

13
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Sha Wu, you take two people with you.

14
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Come with me.

15
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Should we arrange a few more people?

16
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
What's wrong?

17
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,100
I've been following your orders these days.

18
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,100
I want to investigate the case of the bandit who attacked the turtle.

19
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
But an outsider said

20
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
that day he heard the king of the turtle

21
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
screaming in the middle of the road to save him.

22
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
At first,

23
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
the word turtle seems to be a word for the word ru.

24
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Ru...

25
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
I'm wondering if this word

26
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
is the word for ru.

27
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
How did the word ru come up with the word wu?

28
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Oh no!

29
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
The ru is a tiger that breaks the wu.

30
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
We seem to be trapped in a series of traps.

31
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
Someone is trying to set us up.

32
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,100
It's a tiger.

33
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
Yan Xiao Lu,

34
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
lend me your thunder fire bullet.

35
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Are you going back to the Zhu Yi Wei?

36
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Didn't the letter say a few days later?

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
After Zhu Yi Wei receives the letter,

38
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
he will probably go to Qing Feng Temple in advance and wait for me.

39
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Then there must be someone who is ambushed.

40
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
I'll send someone to go with you.

41
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
No need. I'm fine with this.

42
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
This...

43
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Yuan Lu,

44
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
don't go.

45
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
I'll go with him.

46
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
No need.

47
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
This is a private wish between me and Zhu Yi Wei.

48
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Don't get involved in your six-way talks.

49
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
If you don't get involved, then don't get involved.

50
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
I was going to

51
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
buy medicine at the Chuhua Mingshan Town.

52
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
I'll give you a ride.

53
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
What medicine?

54
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
What medicine to buy?

55
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
Antibiotics,

56
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
medicine for healing, poison, all of those things.

57
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
We've used up all of them after the Tian Xing Xia.

58
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
That... Qian Zhao,

59
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I'll give you the test tube when I'm not here.

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Okay.

61
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Ning, do you want me to help you with all these medicines?

62
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
I think it's convenient to have more people to carry the medicine.

63
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Hurry up and help me.

64
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
What are you thinking?

65
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
I...

66
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
I'll go with you.

67
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Okay.

68
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Okay.

69
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Wait for me.

70
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
I'll give you the test tube.

71
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Okay.

72
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
You can go now.

73
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Okay.

74
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
You go.

75
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Okay.

76
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,940
Those birds are from Wu Country.

77
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,260
When you want to hear it,

78
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,780
I'll let it call me.

79
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,140
How can you do that?

80
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,540
Forget it.

81
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,860
You don't understand.

82
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,620
Your Highness.

83
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,140
When I was entering the hall,

84
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,340
I saw a temple at the door.

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,780
If you are really worried,

86
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,980
you can go outside

87
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,700
and catch a handful of mud from Wu Country

88
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,660
that is blessed by the Landlord.

89
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,860
You can wear it

90
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,580
and feel better.

91
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,340
Okay.

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Brother 13.

93
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,820
What are you doing?

94
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,700
The customs of the girl's family.

95
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,100
You don't understand, do you?

96
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,860
The husband and the lover are not around.

97
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,100
So he will take a belt

98
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
or a headband

99
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
and hang it on the tree

100
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
to ask for the blessing of the Landlord.

101
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
No wonder.

102
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,700
Brother 13 is still calling.

103
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,100
Of course.

104
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
I'm saying,

105
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
why doesn't this bandage

106
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
look like it's from the royal family?

107
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
It should be

108
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
the lover of His Highness

109
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
who gave it to him

110
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
in a very gentle way.

111
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Maybe it's

112
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
a gift for him in a gentle way.

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
You want to know?

114
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Wait for me outside.

115
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I want to be alone for a while.

116
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
I heard it.

117
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Anyway, this bandage is safe.

118
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Landlord.

119
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
The bride is in the camp.

120
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Please bless me to go to the country.

121
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
To bring my brother back safely.

122
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
Bless the whole delegation

123
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
to have no danger

124
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
and to face difficulties.

125
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,100
Bless Brother Yuan Zhou and Sister Ru Yi.

126
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
To have a good relationship.

127
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
And Qing Yun.

128
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Please bless Qing Yun.

129
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Do things smoothly.

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
And be promoted soon.

131
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
The bride is waiting for me to go back to the capital.

132
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Qing Yun, I really miss you.

133
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Your Highness.

134
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Qing Yun.

135
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Qing Yun.

136
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Am I dreaming?

137
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Is it really you, Qing Yun?

138
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
It's me. It's me.

139
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Your Highness.

140
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Why are you here?

141
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
I went to the capital on a business.

142
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I was given a ten-day leave.

143
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
I really miss you.

144
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I heard your carriage is nearby.

145
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
I came to find it.

146
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
I was thinking

147
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
if I had a chance to see you.

148
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
I just arrived.

149
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
The Landlord really heard me.

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Don't hurt him.

151
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Your Highness, you know him.

152
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
He is Zheng Qing Yun.

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I...

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
I've been thinking about him.

155
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Are you okay?

156
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm okay.

157
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
You are a guard.

158
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
How dare you spy on the identity of the King.

159
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
How dare you!

160
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Commander Qian,

161
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
take him away right now.

162
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Find a strict guard.

163
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Take me to the office to report.

164
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Then you deal with him.

165
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Sir, I just came to visit you.

166
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I mean no harm.

167
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Stop.

168
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Mr. Du, let me explain.

169
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Your Highness, your identity

170
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
is related to the failure of this accident.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
He didn't come because of the court order.

172
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,660
If the An Guos find out,

173
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
they will cause trouble to the entire delegation.

174
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,780
Take them away.

175
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,940
Your Highness.

176
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,380
Stop.

177
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:09,940
Your Highness, save me.

178
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,340
Your Highness.

179
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,780
Qin Zhao.

180
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,660
I don't want you to stop.

181
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
Do you hear me?

182
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,580
Your Highness.

183
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,580
When Hall Leader Ning is not here,

184
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,380
I will do everything for the delegation.

185
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,300
You are wrong.

186
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,340
I am the one who was appointed as the envoy.

187
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,140
I am the leader of the delegation.

188
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
I know what you are worried about.

189
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,820
I just thought that

190
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,820
I couldn't bear to leave my country.

191
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
Now that Qing Yun is here,

192
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,540
I will be more upset and

193
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,940
unwilling to go to the An Guos.

194
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
But you are wrong.

195
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,740
Qing Yun came to see me.

196
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,220
Although I am happy,

197
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,860
I know better about my responsibilities.

198
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,660
There is no outsider here.

199
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,820
I will not be straightforward.

200
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,820
I appointed myself as the envoy

201
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,220
for the sake of the country,

202
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
for the sake of the people,

203
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,420
and for the sake of the nation.

204
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
The second thing

205
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,740
is for her.

206
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,180
My sister-in-law once promised me

207
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,460
that if I could return to the country,

208
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,700
I would be able to control my own marriage.

209
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,420
Therefore,

210
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,980
although Qing Yun is just a bodyguard today,

211
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,620
she will be the leader of the delegation in the future.

212
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
My two ministers,

213
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,300
please show your respect to Qing Yun.

214
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
It's almost night time.

215
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,100
Please find an empty room

216
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,460
and arrange for the guard to rest.

217
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,220
After I leave tomorrow,

218
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,180
he will return to the capital.

219
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Guard Zheng,

220
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
did you hear that?

221
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Yes.

222
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
In that case,

223
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,380
you should be satisfied.

224
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,460
Your Highness is a talented person.

225
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,340
I am not.

226
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,220
Is it ok?

227
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,180
Come on.

228
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,300
Supporting Your Highness

229
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,060
makes outsiders teenagers Compared to you.

230
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,460
work to be punished!

231
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,400
May you make peace with each other!

232
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Hai!

233
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
Are you leaving now?

234
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,260
Please don't be angry,Stepside!

235
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,800
sit down!

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,640
I....

237
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,400
I'll stay here,gathered with them

238
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,800
Great thing we asked your appearance

239
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,340
has destroyed the kid's foot,hasn't it?

240
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,340
Come on, brother, hang on.

241
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,340
Brother An, you're so nice to me.

242
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Don't waste it.

243
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
I'm punished for my actions.

244
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
I can talk to him, right?

245
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,340
What do you think about Zhen Qingyin?

246
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,340
I asked him secretly when I went to the workshop.

247
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,340
He said that he would go to Yuanzhou,

248
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
and send Xuan De back to his hometown.

249
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Yuanzhou is not far from here.

250
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
Qian, you're from the palace, right?

251
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
You should know his background.

252
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,340
I don't know.

253
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
He's a guard in the imperial guards.

254
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
He's in charge of the inner palace.

255
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
I'm a guard in the imperial guards.

256
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,340
I'm in charge of the imperial palace and the outer palace.

257
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
We may have met before,

258
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,340
but we haven't had any interaction.

259
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Brother Qian, he must have a problem.

260
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Think about it.

261
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
Although we were on the road for a few days,

262
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
how could it be so coincidental?

263
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,340
Brother 13.

264
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Look.

265
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,340
He said that he had sent a public servant.

266
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,340
He got married and found the river line from Yuanzhou.

267
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
When Brother 13 and I were not by his side,

268
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,340
we found the prince.

269
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Brother Lang, do you think it's possible?

270
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,340
I've asked Ding Hui to patrol the area,

271
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
to see if there are any other victims.

272
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,340
I've also asked the maid to keep an eye on the prince.

273
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,340
Don't make any trouble at night.

274
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
This is about the prince's reputation.

275
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
You can't talk nonsense.

276
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,340
I'm keeping an eye on them for the sake of the prince's reputation.

277
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
What's that look?

278
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
What do you know?

279
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,340
I wonder how much affectionate a young man and a young woman can be

280
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
when they haven't seen each other for a long time.

281
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Right?

282
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
Come here.

283
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
The prince is still watching the birds fall into the water.

284
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,340
The prince is still watching the birds fall into the water.

285
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,340
He's taking the initiative to follow the water.

286
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Do you believe Yuan Lu?

287
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Right.

288
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,340
Even Yuan Lu doesn't believe it.

289
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,340
How can you believe it?

290
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,340
Sun Lang.

291
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,340
I'm going to the prince right now.

292
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
I'll be outside the window.

293
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
Oh, no.

294
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,340
Don't let anything big happen.

295
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
I was thinking about running away and running into a trap.

296
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
I...

297
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Go.

298
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
All right.

299
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
Let's stop here.

300
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
According to Zhu Yi Wei's habit,

301
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,340
he will be on the move in three directions.

302
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
I'll go in myself.

303
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
Let me give you a ride.

304
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
No need.

305
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,340
Just one.

306
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,340
You don't want to go to Qingfeng Temple with me, do you?

307
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
I'm not worried about you.

308
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,340
I just want to ask about Zhu Yi Wei's news.

309
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,340
I'll meet him when I go to Angu.

310
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
All right.

311
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
I'm worried about you.

312
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,340
I've recovered 90% of my internal strength.

313
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
It's just a flying corpse.

314
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
Do you think I can't win?

315
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
I know you can win.

316
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,340
But I'm worried that you'll be like Tian Xingxia.

317
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,340
You're so stubborn.

318
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
You don't care about your life.

319
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
How about this?

320
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
You fight with your mother.

321
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
I'll go with you.

322
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
I'll watch from the side.

323
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
I'm used to it.

324
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,340
When I fight,

325
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,340
it's not comfortable for someone to be around.

326
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,340
Then don't treat me like a person.

327
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Treat me like a big tree.

328
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
All right.

329
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,340
Don't be so rude.

330
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
Don't let the child be like you in the future.

331
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,340
You're talking about children.

332
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
If you get hurt once,

333
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
your original energy will be damaged.

334
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Don't you want the child

335
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,340
to be born healthy?

336
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,340
Then I'll be careful

337
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
and don't let myself get hurt.

338
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,340
All right, go to Mishan Town.

339
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
Didn't you say that

340
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
you couldn't buy a lot of medicine in Anguo

341
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
and went to Chu on purpose?

342
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,340
If you go to Qingfeng Temple with me,

343
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
who will buy medicine?

344
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
What if I really get hurt later?

345
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,340
I don't even have a life to live.

346
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
Can you stop saying

347
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,340
such a thing that makes people scared?

348
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
You and the Hall Leader of the Six Halls

349
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,340
usually have a lot of blood.

350
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,340
Suddenly you're so timid.

351
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
I used to be a man of no use.

352
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
But now you're here.

353
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,340
Okay, I won't say it anymore.

354
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,340
Then this time

355
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,340
you let me solve it myself.

356
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
If you expose it,

357
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Ru Yiwei will know about our identities

358
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
and it will be bad for the delegation.

359
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
All right, then.

360
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
I can't beat you anyway.

361
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,340
All right, don't worry.

362
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,340
I'll go back to the courier station early tomorrow.

363
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,340
How about this?

364
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
After I buy the medicine in the Mishan Town,

365
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
I'll wait for you near Liu's Manor.

366
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Then we'll go back to the courier station together, okay?

367
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
Okay.

368
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
This way.

369
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Be careful.

370
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,340
Uncle.

371
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
What are you doing?

372
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Let's go.

373
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
Let's go.

374
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,340
Let's go.

375
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,340
Let's go.

376
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Let's go.

377
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
Ru Yi.

378
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,340
You're Ru Yi.

379
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Save your energy.

380
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
If you're in danger,

381
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,340
you'll be useless in a short time.

382
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
They...

383
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
Why did you kill the people in the coffin?

384
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,340
How do I know if you set up the camp on purpose?

385
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,340
What if they're your accomplices?

386
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,340
They're innocent.

387
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
You'd rather kill them than let them go.

388
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,340
Why can't you?

389
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
Tell me.

390
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,340
Which country are you from?

391
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,340
When did you break into the Wudu Branch?

392
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
I don't believe you.

393
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
Tell me or not?

394
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
I'll tell you.

395
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
You'll kill me.

396
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,340
You're the Flying Division.

397
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,340
You betrayed your subordinates and the entire Wudu Branch.

398
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,340
If this goes out,

399
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,340
I'm afraid you can't even sit in your command room.

400
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,340
I want someone who can control the sword and the sword.

401
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
Or you'll kill me.

402
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,340
My men will also put this corpse in the court of the An Kingdom.

403
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,340
You want to see your superior?

404
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,340
I made this formation needle myself.

406
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
You want to use it to hurt me?

407
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Chen Huizhen, you're not a bad person.

408
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,340
What are you doing?

409
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,340
You said what I said to you.

410
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Since that superior knows,

411
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,340
he must be the one who ordered Yue Sanniang to do it.

412
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,340
Only the commander and the left and right

413
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,340
can think of superior's name in the Wudu Branch.

414
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Tell me who he is.

415
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,340
I made the poison myself.

416
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
You can't get rid of it.

417
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,340
I will never betray superior.

418
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
Never.

419
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,340
It's just those three people.

420
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
If you don't tell me,

421
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
can't I find out?

422
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
You devil.

423
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Even if you find out,

424
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,340
he's done.

425
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,340
You're done.

426
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,340
You could have escaped when you were in Wudu.

427
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,340
But for him,

428
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,340
you still have been a white dog for a year.

429
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,340
For you, he must be very important.

430
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
What did you say?

431
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
You devil.

432
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,340
Or you're just like Ouyang Shi.

433
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
I've already sent someone to catch him.

434
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,340
You...

435
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
It's the Fire Token.

436
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,340
It's the Fire Token.

437
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,340
That's the direction of Liu's Manor.

438
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
No.

439
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
Sir, we're in danger.

440
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,340
We have to go back now.

441
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,340
Sir, you want us to take Ouyang Shi back to the capital as soon as possible.

442
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
We can't be late.

443
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,340
If you see the Fire Token,

444
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,340
you have to reinforce it immediately.

445
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
Have you forgotten the rules?

446
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,340
Let's go.

447
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
No.

448
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
No.

449
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Hua Gai is coming to support us.

450
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
He's hurt Zhu Ji Da.

451
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
Get him.

452
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
No.

453
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,340
Ru Yi, put down the sword.

454
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Or I'll kill your mother.

455
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
I was wrong.

456
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
It's all my fault.

457
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,340
I didn't listen to your arrangement.

458
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,340
That's why I fell into their hands.

459
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Put down the sword.

460
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
Ru Yi, don't let Ru Yi go.

461
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
Or we'll both die.

462
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
Shut up.

463
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Go.

464
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Go.

465
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Mother.

466
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Retreat.

467
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Hurry.

468
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
Go.

469
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,340
Go.

470
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Go.

471
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Go.

472
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
Go.

473
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,340
Go.

474
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Go.

475
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Go.

476
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,340
Go.

477
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,340
Ru Yi.

478
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Ru Yi.

479
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
I'll give you blood if you're hurt.

480
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,340
Ru Yi.

481
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Calm down.

482
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
Ru Yi.

483
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
It's okay.

484
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
Ru Yi, calm down.

485
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Ru Yi.

486
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
I want to revenge for my mother.

487
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,340
I didn't listen to your arrangement.

488
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Go.

489
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
Qing Yun.

490
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Your Highness.

491
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Qing Yun.

492
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Your Highness.

493
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
They were so close.

494
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,340
How did you get out?

495
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,340
I was watching my maid.

496
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
Do you know?

497
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,340
I saved her life in the Sky Castle.

498
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
I begged her.

499
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
She must have agreed.

500
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
I miss you so much.

502
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,340
Me too.

503
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
No.

504
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,340
You can't.

505
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,340
I really miss you.

506
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,340
Let me hug you.

507
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,340
Just let me hug you.

508
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Fire.

509
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
Fire.

510
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
Fire.

511
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,340
Help.

512
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
Help.

513
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Stop.

514
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Team leader.

515
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Help.

516
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Team leader.

517
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
Help.

518
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Fire! Fire!

519
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Fire! Fire! Fire!

520
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Your Highness! Your Highness!

521
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Where is Your Highness?

522
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
She's gone.

523
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
How can we see her?

524
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,340
I've rescued Your Highness.

525
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Your Highness!

526
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Where is the Governor?

527
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
There!

528
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
The Governor is dead!

529
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,340
I don't understand!

530
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
Come on!

531
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,340
Fire!

532
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
Fire!

533
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Wolf, change to the Governor.

534
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Come with me.

535
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
Yes!

536
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Follow me!

537
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Watch my heart.

538
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Don't worry.

539
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
Your Highness, you rest there.

540
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
We'll take care of the outside.

541
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Fire!

542
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Your Highness, let's go!

543
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,340
Go!

544
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Old Seven! Yun Jiang!

545
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Leave me alone!

546
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,340
What happened?

547
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
The bandits took all the gold.

548
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Let's save our lives first.

549
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Go!

550
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,340
I don't have much time with him.

551
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Five years ago, he saved me from the old wounds.

552
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
He helped me to apply the medicine.

553
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,340
Then I helped him to work.

554
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
He cooked for me.

555
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,340
Not long after, he told the villagers

556
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,340
that I was his daughter who fell into the water after getting married.

557
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,340
Until he died, I only called him Ji Shengniang.

558
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,340
But last night, in order to keep me from being punished,

559
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,340
he created the sword of Zhu Yiwei.

560
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:00,340
In your heart, he is your mother.

561
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,340
You don't have to do this.

562
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,340
I'll go with you.

563
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,340
Go.

564
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
You can leave now.

565
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,340
I'll pay attention to the situation in the future.

566
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,340
You have no idea why the Empress left you that last word.

567
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
She doesn't want me to care about her.

568
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,340
I don't think it's just that.

569
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:30,340
She wants you to forget Zhu Yiwei, forget about killing, forget about revenge.

570
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
She wants you to live a normal life.

571
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,340
She just wants me to have my own child.

572
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,340
And don't fall in love with men.

573
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,340
That's right.

574
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
Her Highness cares about you so much.

575
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,340
But why doesn't she want you to fall in love with men?

576
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,340
As the Empress of Yi Country, she's in danger.

577
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,340
Her husband didn't send guards to protect her.

578
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
He just wanted you to be alone.

579
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
After you escaped from the fire,

580
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,340
she immediately ordered your death sentence.

581
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,340
And she asked the court not to mention your name again.

582
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Have you thought about all of this?

583
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Of course I have.

584
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
I know.

585
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:30,340
In your heart, the wise Empress will never leave anyone to be deposed.

586
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,340
So you will help Andie.

587
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
I believe you have guessed it.

588
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,340
When the fire at the Demon House started,

589
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Her Highness was already disappointed with Andie.

590
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
She just wanted to die.

591
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,340
She has a son.

592
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,340
But before she died, the person she cared about the most was you.

593
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
She knows you are so attached to your feelings.

594
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
But she doesn't want you to have a bad future.

595
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,340
She doesn't want you to have a bad future and fall in love with a man you shouldn't love.

596
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,340
That's why she left such a strange message.

597
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,340
She just wants you to live happily.

598
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,340
Your Highness.

599
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,340
Your Highness.

600
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
Ru Yi.

601
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,340
I also hope you can live happily.

602
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,340
Why are you so good to me?

603
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Because I know I will never meet a woman like you again.

604
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,340
I will never meet a woman like you again.

605
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,340
I am a member of the Six Halls.

606
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,340
I have lived my whole life under the shadow of the sun.

607
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Pessimism, secret messages, murder, and emotions.

608
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,340
These are all secret words that cannot be mentioned to others.

609
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,340
Even if the women in the Six Halls mention it,

610
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,340
they can't really understand me.

611
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,340
But you are not.

612
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,340
You have the same position, the same thoughts, the same past.

613
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
You have the same thoughts, the same past.

614
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,340
You have the same concerns.

615
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,340
I understand your pain.

616
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,340
You also understand my helplessness.

617
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,340
So in front of you, I can fully open myself.

618
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,340
Then why didn't you agree at first?

619
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Because this time I went to the dark state.

620
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
I was destined to die.

621
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,340
Instead of being obsessed with death,

622
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,340
I should have started over from the beginning.

623
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Then why did you change your mind?

624
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,340
Because I am afraid of loneliness.

625
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

626
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

627
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

628
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

629
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

630
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

631
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

632
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

633
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

634
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

635
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

636
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

637
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

638
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

639
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

640
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

641
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,340
I am afraid of loneliness.

642
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,340
Who drinks a cup of fengshui,

643
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,340
and falls into the abyss?

644
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Who sighs for a moment and then leaves?

645
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,340
The sky is dark and the road is flowing.

646
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,340
Looking back, the future is so beautiful.

647
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:38,340
The world is so beautiful.

648
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,340
Who will stay with the life and drink with the wine?

649
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,340
Who is a little worried?

650
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,340
Who is a little worried?

651
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Who is afraid that the dream will come true?

652
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,340
Only for the wind to come back.

653
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,340
How many years have passed since the last snow fell?

654
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,340
Who is a little worried?

655
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:12,340
The whole life is not for the people to drink with.

656
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Who is a little worried?

657
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Who is a little worried?

658
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,340
Who is a little worried?

659
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,340
Who is a little worried?

660
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,340
Who is a little worried?

661
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
Who is a little worried?

662
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Who is a little worried?

663
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
Who is a little worried?

664
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Who is a little worried?

665
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,340
Who is a little worried?
