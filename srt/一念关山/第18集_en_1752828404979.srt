1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next has been...

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind blows the wind

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The wind blows the wind

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows the wind

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows the wind

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The wind blows the wind

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The wind blows the wind

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The wind blows the wind

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The wind blows the wind

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind blows the wind

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind blows the wind

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The wind blows the wind

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The wind blows the wind

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The wind blows the wind

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The wind blows the wind

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The wind blows the wind

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The wind blows the wind

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The wind blows the wind

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The wind blows the wind

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The wind blows the wind

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Episode 2

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who is it?

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's me.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Your Highness?

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your Highness?

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Coming.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your Highness.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Are you okay?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Get up.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My back.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I wanted to apologize to you.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But you fell down again.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm the one who's wronged.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's Zheng Qingyun who hurt me.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Not you.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Besides,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
your girl came to my room

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in the middle of the night.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She came to my room in a bloody room.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What do you mean?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, don't cry.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I...

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I just want to make a joke

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to make you feel better.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I...

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think I'm wronged again.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sad because

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
no one has said I'm a girl for a long time.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going to die in the country.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In the world,

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
except you,

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Rong Yijie and Brother Yuanzhou,

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm afraid not many people

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
know I'm actually a princess.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, not necessarily.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
After you die,

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:19,520
you will come to the

61
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
after you die.

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Right.

63
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
I'll get it right,

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,020
when I die,

65
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,020
I must be a hero.

66
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
I must be one,

67
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
who can do all kinds of things.

68
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I want the world to see

69
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,020
how strong I died.

70
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,020
How much...

71
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
I'm not going to do that.

72
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Look at you.

73
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,060
You're in pain again.

74
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,380
You finally got better.

75
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,060
Why are you saying these kind of things to yourself?

76
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,700
This is not cursing.

77
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,860
I've known since I was a kid that I can't live more than 20 years.

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
Really.

79
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,020
Although I can't arrange how I was born,

80
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,220
I have to think of a way to die.

81
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,940
I can't be so scared

82
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,900
and wait for death.

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Right?

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
But you...

85
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,620
You know me better.

86
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,380
When I went out with her,

87
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,100
she didn't say a word.

88
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,060
In this life,

89
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,580
we should be happy and happy.

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,180
Just like you, Your Highness.

91
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,340
If you marry a husband,

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,060
you'll spend the rest of your life like this.

93
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,900
You'll spend the rest of your life like this.

94
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,740
In two years, no one will remember you.

95
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,860
But this time,

96
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,220
when you go to the country and meet the emperor,

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,500
even if you die,

98
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,140
the embassy will also give you a form

99
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,300
to write a novel.

100
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,380
Like a woman dressed as a man,

101
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,940
or a national heroine.

102
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,500
At least four lines.

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Really?

104
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,900
Really.

105
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,580
Sister-in-law told me before

106
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,700
that the greatest honor of a king's life

107
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,140
is to have a good reputation in history.

108
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,220
Look, why should I lie to you?

109
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,180
So you have to get well soon.

110
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,020
By then,

111
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,180
you should behave yourself in front of those officials in An State.

112
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,740
Show them your attitude of a king.

113
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,540
Let them see you.

114
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,180
Don't cry anymore.

115
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,620
Right.

116
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,940
I almost forgot.

117
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,540
You were still thinking about it.

118
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Is it because of Zheng Qingyun?

119
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,740
No.

120
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,540
I...

121
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,420
I...

122
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,820
I was hurt because of Youhai.

123
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,500
I feel guilty, so I can't think of anything else.

124
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,780
It's not because of Zheng Qingyun.

125
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,100
This bastard is nothing to me.

126
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,900
Right.

127
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Wait.

128
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,100
When the day comes,

129
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,340
I can go to see that Cheng Qinghou.

130
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,700
Good.

131
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,500
Well said.

132
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,780
This is the king of my house.

133
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,180
King of Li.

134
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,500
Yuanluo,

135
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,980
give me an idea.

136
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,180
If I really have an accident in An State,

137
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,780
how can I write a good name in history?

138
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,540
I want to wear a flower dress.

139
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,100
This is the princess's most formal dress.

140
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,940
I only wore it when I saw her as a general.

141
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
Poison.

142
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,700
I asked Qian to make a good poison for me.

143
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,500
I can drink it when I feel itchy.

144
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I promise I won't look pale even if I die.

145
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,180
Really?

146
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,860
Really.

147
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,700
Qian has this?

148
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,820
Well...

149
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,180
Can you make it a little bit better?

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,700
It's better to be sweet.

151
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
This...

152
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,820
This is a bit difficult.

153
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,500
No.

154
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,900
I have to make it difficult.

155
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,700
I'll give it to him tomorrow.

156
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,780
I'll tell him like this.

157
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,940
Qian, listen carefully.

158
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,700
I want you to make me the best poison in the world.

159
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,180
It's best to be sour and delicious.

160
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,980
How about sweet?

161
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,100
Sweet and sour is better.

162
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,500
I think sweet is better.

163
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Sweet and sour is the best.

164
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,820
This is really not good.

165
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,980
Fine.

166
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,500
Just sweet and sour.

167
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Sweet and sour.

168
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Sweet and sour.

169
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Sweet and sour.

170
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,300
There's your brother here.

171
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,060
No.

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I suddenly can't open my mouth

173
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Every turn

174
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I have a reason from now on

175
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
The little red dust is like a nest

176
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
The heart is in different places

177
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,500
It's not necessary

178
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,500
The lullaby in a dream

179
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,500
They are the troubles about our hearts

180
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
The fate is psiing

181
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I always forget the sound of your smile

182
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,500
The white racehorse shivers Espape

183
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
The world is lost

184
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,760
are swarming throughout being

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,500
together.

186
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,380
Chamberlain Zhao isn't with you.

187
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,300
Sound off.

188
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,260
I just want to remind him that

189
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,300
Chong follows Lu lasейств speaks.

190
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,880
You'll see excited by him.

191
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
I heard everything Yuan Luo told you.

192
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Do you want to know?

193
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
No.

194
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
You didn't sleep last night, right?

195
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
You're so jealous.

196
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
You think you did nothing wrong,

197
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
but you're so excited again.

198
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
You look like you're about to kill someone.

199
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,880
So I'm here to help you.

200
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Good.

201
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I don't need your help.

202
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
I can handle it myself.

203
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
You're not a good mouth.

204
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
You don't have much hair.

205
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Ning Tao, good morning.

206
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
What the hell?

207
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
No.

208
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
No.

209
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Ning Tao.

210
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Sit down.

211
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
I discussed with Mr. Du yesterday.

212
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
This Changxin Monkey

213
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
can still be fought.

214
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
One soft, one hard.

215
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
There are two ways.

216
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
The hard one is

217
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
to say that the bandits sent by the King of Danyang

218
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
are the spies.

219
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
The hard one is

220
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
to say that the bandits sent by the King of Danyang

221
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
are the spies.

222
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Then we said that

223
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
they were hiding the truth

224
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
and didn't have the heart to talk.

225
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
The soft one

226
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
is to say that

227
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
the main plot of the bandits

228
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
is to fight with the two princes

229
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
who are not compatible with Changxin Monkey.

230
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
They want to frame Changxin Monkey

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
with this.

232
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
We're hinting Changxin Monkey

233
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
to finish the task

234
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
as long as he helps us.

235
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
We'll invest in him

236
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
and keep him in our hands.

237
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
See?

238
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
When I mentioned Changxin Monkey,

239
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I was so embarrassed.

240
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
I wish I could break him at any time.

241
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
If you don't have any objection,

242
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
I'll discuss with that Changxin Monkey

243
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
in this way.

244
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Wait.

245
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Your Highness,

246
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
I think

247
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Miss Ruyi

248
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
is more suitable

249
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
to negotiate with Changxin Monkey.

250
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Mr. Du.

251
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Mr. Ning, yesterday we all saw

252
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
that Changxin Monkey

253
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
is quite different from Miss Ruyi.

254
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Mr. Du,

255
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
I've said it many times.

256
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Miss Ruyi has nothing to do with this.

257
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Mr. Ning,

258
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
please forgive me for my own mistake.

259
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Miss Ruyi,

260
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
can you persuade Changxin Monkey

261
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
to help us to finish the task?

262
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
I hope you can

263
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
do that.

264
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Mr. Du,

265
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm afraid you forget that I'm not from Liudao Hall.

266
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Whether your task is successful

267
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
or not, it has nothing to do with me.

268
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
But Miss Ruyi,

269
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
aren't you

270
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Mr. Ning's subordinate?

271
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Xuanzhou,

272
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
should I be your subordinate?

273
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Of course not.

274
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Mr. Du,

275
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Miss Ruyi is the daughter of the professor I invited.

276
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
She is not suitable

277
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
to be involved in the negotiation.

278
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Mr. Ning,

279
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
it's a big matter.

280
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Mr. Du.

281
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
You want to ask me for help?

282
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Why do you ask Ning Yuanzhou?

283
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Even if I want to help you,

284
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
as Princess Hu Yang,

285
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
are you going to talk to her like this?

286
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm asking Princess

287
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
to help me.

288
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Mr. Du.

289
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
You want me to leave the delegation.

290
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
But Mr. Du asked me to stay.

291
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
It's hard to do.

292
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I asked you to leave the delegation before.

293
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
I broke my promise.

294
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
But about Chang Qinghou,

295
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
please think twice.

296
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Mr. Ning.

297
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Tao.

298
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Tao.

299
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Your Highness.

300
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Mr. Du.

301
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Chang Qinghou came again.

302
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
He brought a big gift.

303
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
He said he was disturbed by you yesterday.

304
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
So he came to visit you today.

305
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Miss Ruyi.

306
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Mr. Ning.

307
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
He said you were still sick.

308
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880
I'll see him today.

309
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
I want to change.

310
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Ruyi.

311
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Yu Shisan.

312
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Beauty is here.

313
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Don't worry, beauty.

314
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
I'll use my power to make you look gorgeous.

315
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Come on.

316
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Come on.

317
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Master Sun.

318
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Send more people to follow.

319
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
We'd better ask around.

320
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Yes.

321
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Yuan Lu.

322
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Send His Highness back to rest.

323
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Yes.

324
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
You want to leave your cousin

325
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
because you are jealous?

326
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
No wonder he doesn't look good to you.

327
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
But when you were

328
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
giving him a big gift,

329
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
he was obviously a little sad.

330
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Do you want to seize the opportunity?

331
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
You are Qian Zhao.

332
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
You are not Yu Shisan.

333
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
You are a man of honor.

334
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I am a man of appearance.

335
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I know his thoughts and concerns.

336
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
But I also have my own position.

337
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
I was too anxious about this.

338
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
But did you see that?

339
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
He was so excited

340
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
in front of everyone.

341
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
I used to think that

342
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
you could be full of energy.

343
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
But I was wrong today.

344
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Do you know why I,

345
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Sun Lang, and Ding Hui

346
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
have been so obsessed with you?

347
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Why?

348
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Because we can't even find

349
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
a cousin who wants to stimulate us.

350
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Yu Shisan is already

351
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
in a state of shock.

352
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
If you don't go to her

353
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
I can't stop her.

354
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
One is a man of honor

355
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
and the other is a man of love.

356
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Which one is stronger than you?

357
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Don't you believe that I will beat you?

358
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
You can't do that.

359
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
And I have to go

360
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
to pick up Tong Guang.

361
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I can't believe it.

362
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
It's like a dream.

363
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
I can't believe it.

364
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
It's like a dream.

365
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
I can't believe it.

366
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
You are a good student.

367
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
You have the same eyes as Ru Yi.

368
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Tao,

369
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
do you think that

370
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Marquis Changqing already knows

371
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
that Ru Yi and you...

372
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
I just wanted to know

373
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
if you are her friend.

374
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I can tell that

375
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
you are her friend.

376
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
You are definitely her friend.

377
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
But you don't have to tell everyone

378
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
that I am your friend.

379
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
You are my friend.

380
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
I just want to ask you guys.

381
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,880
You guys can't contact each other and you can't talk, right?

382
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
No, what's wrong with him? Tell me.

383
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
What's wrong with his eyes?

384
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Tao, I...

385
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Can I ask you one more question?

386
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Say it.

387
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Do you really want Ru Yi to leave the delegation?

388
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,880
But apart from Ning Tong, the most important thing in our delegation is Ru Yi.

389
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
You two had a fight today.

390
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Actually, everyone is worried about you.

391
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Even the head of the delegation asked the prince about you two.

392
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
This is not as simple as you think.

393
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
And even if Ru Yi left,

394
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm still here.

395
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
You're right.

396
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
But Ning Tong, although Ru Yi, the prince, and the head of the delegation are not from our six sects,

397
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
but if you want to save the king,

398
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,880
everyone in our delegation is indispensable.

399
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
They are all the core of the delegation.

400
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Of course, you will always be our Ning Tong.

401
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
You know I'm not considerate,

402
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,880
but you never stop me from working hard with you.

403
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,880
But why would you let Ru Yi leave the delegation just because of a little Chang Qing Hou?

404
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
This Chang Qing Hou,

405
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,880
apart from being younger than Ning Tong,

406
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
knowing Ru Yi's time is longer than Ning Tong,

407
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
and she looks so pretty,

408
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,880
it seems like she has no other special features.

409
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
If I were Ru Yi,

410
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I would feel wronged.

411
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
You're lying.

412
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
You say you like me and believe me.

413
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
You're lying.

414
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
You didn't take your medicine today, did you?

415
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
In your heart, your brother is just a little boy.

416
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,880
I can't take a little Chang Qing Hou.

417
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
This is what Ru Yi said, not what I said.

418
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,880
I heard that Prince Li has improved.

419
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
I wonder when he will be granted the title.

420
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Thank you for your question, my lord.

421
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,880
But you have been worried about your father since you were a child.

422
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Since you entered Xu City,

423
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
you have been frightened by the army of your country.

424
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,880
I'm afraid it will take some time for him to recover.

425
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Really?

426
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
It seems that the six Taoist churches in your country are just like this.

427
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
You personally protected the throne,

428
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
but you still let Prince Li be frightened.

429
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
No wonder your country's king will be...

430
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,880
My lord, please be careful.

431
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Okay, let's get down to business.

432
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Our country's emperor is not a man of war.

433
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
I hope that Prince Li will arrive in Andu in seven days.

434
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
In seven days?

435
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
How is that possible?

436
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
If his highness...

437
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
If his highness is deliberately delaying,

438
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm afraid that he will not be able to see his majesty.

439
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
By then,

440
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
he will have to be with his majesty and the king of your country

441
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
to spend more days in Andu.

442
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
My lord, you are forcing...

443
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Since you can't see him,

444
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
don't let Prince Li go.

445
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Princess.

446
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Lord Du, you may leave.

447
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
You don't need to explain some things.

448
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm a strange person in the imperial clan.

449
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm the only one who can say bad things.

450
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Yes.

451
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I'm sorry.

455
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm sorry.

456
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm sorry.

459
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm sorry.

460
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I'm sorry.

461
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I'm sorry.

462
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I'm sorry.

464
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm sorry.

465
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Master.

466
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Master.

467
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Why are you different from before?

468
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
How?

469
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Of course I'm different.

470
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Keep your voice down.

471
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
I used the powder of South Kingdom

472
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
to make his face and eyes.

473
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
And I added the rouge to make his lips more pure.

474
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,880
And I used the smoke to light up his little finger.

475
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
It's definitely the soul of the old man.

476
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
He's definitely a good man.

477
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
Wait.

478
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Why do you wear the rouge with you?

479
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,880
Why would the swordsman wear his sword with him?

480
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
Next time when you see Lord Jin,

481
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
remember to change your words.

482
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
His words are the same.

483
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Lord Jin has already been in trouble.

484
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
He forgot to go outside.

485
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
The problem is that

486
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Lord Jin has a good opinion.

487
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
He doesn't even want to be killed.

488
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
What do you think I'm doing?

489
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
You're rude again.

490
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Master.

491
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
I drove away all the guards of the Hexian.

492
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
There are no other people in this house.

493
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
You can meet each other again.

494
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
I'll say it again.

495
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
I'm not your master.

496
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Don't be so cruel.

497
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
I miss you so much.

498
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Don't you remember the past?

499
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
When we were on the stage.

500
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Okay.

501
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
If you must think I'm your master,

502
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
it's not impossible.

503
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
But are you going to sit down

504
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
and listen to me?

505
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Please.

506
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
What I said just now

507
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
to make Lord Li not enter the capital

508
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
is just a lie.

509
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Actually, we know that

510
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
the king of your country

511
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
arrived in the capital within seven days

512
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
of the delegation.

513
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
He just wanted to give us

514
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,880
a horse-riding position.

515
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
But in fact,

516
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
most of us in the Wu Dynasty

517
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
are against Lord Li entering the capital.

518
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,880
I'm not against it.

519
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Most of us are against

520
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Lord Li entering the capital.

521
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Now the king of Danyang

522
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
is determined to win the war.

523
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm afraid that the most

524
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
wanted peace talks in the world

525
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
is him.

526
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
But what does this have to do with me?

527
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
You know it.

528
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
As far as I know,

529
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
although you have gained

530
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
the power of your country,

531
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
you have always been

532
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
disliked by Lord He Dong and Lord Luo Xi.

533
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
No matter who

534
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
enters the throne in the future,

535
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
I'm afraid you will be like a real man.

536
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
I wonder who you want to

537
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
pull out of these two kings.

538
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
We are willing to help you

539
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
to push the theft

540
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
to another person

541
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
whom you don't like.

542
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
In this way,

543
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
you can take this gift

544
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
as a chance to get closer to you.

545
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
You are kind-hearted.

546
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
But I don't like

547
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
your kind-heartedness.

548
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
What about the two cities

549
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Yun and Mian?

550
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
I don't know.

551
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
As far as I know,

552
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
you don't have a place to be.

553
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
If you are willing to help

554
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
my brother Li to return to the emperor

555
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
safely,

556
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm willing to use this city

557
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
to help you

558
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
to get closer to him.

559
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
To get closer to him?

560
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
You are too high-minded.

561
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm just a

562
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
face-to-face person.

563
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm just a face-to-face person.

564
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm just a

565
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
reckless martial artist.

566
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
I have no right to be with you.

567
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
But the king of the two countries

568
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
of Awu

569
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
is also a small martial artist.

570
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
If I'm willing to

571
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
promise you,

572
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
can you promise me

573
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
one thing?

574
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Please be straightforward.

575
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
Please take a seat.

576
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
And then?

577
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Don't talk.

578
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Close your eyes.

579
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Master, you are so nice.

580
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Don't run around in the future.

581
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Do you understand?

582
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Master,

583
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
I really regret it.

584
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I shouldn't have had a fight with you that day.

585
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
I knew you were going to the Princess's Mansion to see me.

586
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
I was hiding in the street.

587
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Master,

588
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
the fire in the prison is so big.

589
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
Does it hurt?

590
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Master,

591
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
I really miss you.

592
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
I miss you so much.

593
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
I also jump over the cold spring you took me to.

594
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
I miss you so much.

595
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
I want to die there every time.

596
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Because of this,

597
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I can see you earlier.

598
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Don't cry.

599
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Or I'll beat you.

600
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Master.

601
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Master.

602
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Master.

603
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Don't save me.

604
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
I will never forget.

605
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
It's so good.

606
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Even if I die in this life,

607
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
I will still remember all the love.

608
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Is it worth it?

609
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
If you are lost in your heart.

610
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
The sky in my dream.

611
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
The sky in my dream.

612
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
I still can't forget.

613
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I still can't forget.

614
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I still can't forget.

615
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I still can't forget.

616
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
What is he talking about?

617
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
It's worth it to die.

618
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
This is a true story.

619
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
I have to admit it.

620
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
If I had no one, I would have admitted it.

621
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Is he really just Ruyi's disciple?

622
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,880
He treats her better than Ning Tou treats her.

623
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Don't be so cold.

624
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Princess.

625
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
His Highness just woke up.

626
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
He is in a hurry to see you.

627
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
I know.

628
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Marquis.

629
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,880
We won't accompany you.

630
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
We?

631
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Me and Princess.

632
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
We will escort Prince Li to the bed.

633
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Of course, it's us.

634
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
I have done what you want.

635
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
I hope you will keep your promise.

636
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
Think about it.

637
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Yes.

638
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Marquis.

639
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I have to go.

640
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I have to go.

641
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Marquis.

642
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
He is not my master.

643
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
He looks like my master.

644
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
But he is just a fake.

645
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
My master only cares about Ruyi and the Empress.

646
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
He doesn't care about politics.

647
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
He is not as cunning as this princess.

648
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
She is so cunning.

649
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
She is so cunning.

650
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
She is so cunning.

651
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
She is just like my master.

652
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
She is just like my master.

653
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Marquis is so cunning.

654
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
There are so many people who look alike.

655
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
There are so many people who look alike.

656
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
How about we stay away from this princess?

657
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
How about we stay away from this princess?

658
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
So you won't be upset.

659
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
No. I want her.

660
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
As long as she can make me sit beside her like before.

661
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
As long as she can make me sit beside her like before.

662
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
I will think my master is still here.

663
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
I haven't tasted this kind of happiness for a long time.

664
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
I haven't tasted this kind of happiness for a long time.

665
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
So

666
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
No matter if she is a fake,

667
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
No matter if she is a fake,

668
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
I will get her

669
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,880
I will get her

670
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I will never let her go.

671
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
I will never let her go.

672
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
Ruyi.

673
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I am leaving.

674
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
You heard everything outside.

675
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
You heard everything outside.

676
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
What else can you say?

677
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
What else can you say?

678
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
I didn't doubt anything.

679
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
I admit,

680
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
I am a little jealous.

681
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
I am a little jealous.

682
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
But I didn't go in because I was jealous or jealous.

683
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
But I didn't go in because I was jealous or jealous.

684
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
I was afraid that the boy would make a mistake.

685
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,880
I was afraid that the boy would make a mistake.

686
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
So I couldn't help it.

687
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
So I couldn't help it.

688
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
I was afraid that the boy would make a mistake.

689
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I was afraid that the boy would make a mistake.

690
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
And then I thought

691
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
But

692
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
But I was not sure

693
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
But I was not sure

694
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
I thought

695
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
I might forget

696
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
I thought

697
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
But I still had to go.

698
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I still had to go.

699
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,680
Although he was a bad person since he was a child,

700
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,880
I never stopped him from doing anything.

701
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,880
But when I faced you,

702
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
I forced my own wish upon you.

703
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
I didn't care about your feelings.

704
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,880
I'm sorry.

705
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,480
Thank you for telling me this.

706
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,280
I think I know what you're thinking.

707
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
But there's one thing

708
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,280
that we need to talk about.

709
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Actually, I've been very confused these past two days.

710
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Do you remember what you said in the yard that day?

711
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
You said that you wanted to take me to a deserted island

712
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,280
to hide after this mission is completed.

713
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,280
You said that I would like to live a life like that.

714
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,280
But actually, I wanted to say something.

715
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,280
But seeing you so happy and determined,

716
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I didn't say anything.

717
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
So,

718
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,280
you don't like that kind of life at all?

719
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
I don't like that kind of life.

720
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,280
That's it, you said that.

721
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,920
In the past, I thought that I was used to reading and recalling

722
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
and that I would stay in the proper distance among people

723
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,400
and watch everything with my eyes.

724
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:57,400
I found out that the light of the five-color and the fire of the mortal world in the common desert are so beautiful.

725
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,400
It's so beautiful that I doubt if I really lived before.

726
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I like the feeling of being dragged behind by someone when I'm with you.

727
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
There are friends in the love group who are noisy.

728
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I like seeing fresh people and things everywhere.

729
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Yuan Zhou, actually, you brought me all of this.

730
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
So that's what you thought.

731
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I never knew.

732
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I thought you were hurt by Anguo and Zhu Yiwei.

733
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,400
You hate those dirty tricks and those cold-blooded tricks.

734
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
You hate bloodshed and killing.

735
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:58,400
And I remember you told me that the Empress Zhao Jing also wanted you to live an ordinary life.

736
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
I thought that was the life you wanted.

737
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Yes.

738
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
I hate Zhu Yiwei.

739
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I hate that girl who is a toy and the dirty tricks of the killing tools.

740
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,400
But I don't hate to do something for my partner Li Nan by myself.

741
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,400
I could be the violent political prisoner of other countries.

742
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
I could kill the high-ranking official of the people.

743
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,400
In the future, maybe there will be a more powerful world to serve me.

744
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Maybe it's not that great or smooth.

745
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
But I still hope that I could be like Meiniang.

746
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Be a monk or a nun or do something else.

747
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,400
I could do something for those women who are suffering in Zhu Yiwei by myself.

748
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Instead of...

749
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Instead of living the life she wants with a man.

750
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,400
To be a monk or nun or to live alone is two different things.

751
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
So...

752
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Let's think about it, okay?

753
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Okay.

754
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Will you leave Shi Dan?

755
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Don't worry.

756
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
I won't leave Shi Dan.

757
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
We are not in a cold war.

758
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,400
But only two people think it through.

759
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Then they know whether they can go on.

760
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Right?

761
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Yes.

762
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Who wants to be separated for a lifetime?

763
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,400
The sky is scattered like water.

764
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,400
People are like the snow in the mountains.

765
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,400
How many years have passed?

766
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,400
I have no one to spend my life with.

767
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Ning Tao.

768
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Tao.

769
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
What's wrong?

770
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Please come in.

771
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Okay.

772
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Yuan Lu.

773
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Do you understand?

774
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Have they made up?

775
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
They must have.

776
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Look at Ru Yi's expression.

777
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
She is calm and calm.

778
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Then why did Brother Yuan Zhou slap her face?

779
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Well...

780
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
You don't know?

781
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,400
It's a big deal if two people quarrel and separate quietly.

782
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
What?

783
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
They just quarreled.

784
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Why is it so bad all of a sudden?

785
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
I tried to persuade her for so long.

786
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I told her to help Sister Ru Yi.

787
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
But she didn't say no.

788
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
It's not something that can be solved by helping her.

789
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Being jealous is just a shadow.

790
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,400
It's a big deal if you are jealous.

791
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Both of them are like the sand in the eyes.

792
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Something bad is going to happen.

793
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
What should we do?

794
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,400
We can only act separately.

795
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Yuan Lu, go to find Meiren.

796
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Meiren is cold and soft.

797
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
You should talk to her.

798
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Tell her that Ning Tao is very sad every day.

799
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
She drinks a lot of wine every day.

800
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Do you understand?

801
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Yes.

802
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Your Highness, go to find Ning Tao.

803
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
What is the most lacking in women?

804
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Understand, right?

805
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,400
You should tell her to understand Meiren's sadness.

806
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,400
In short, we can't let their cracks expand.

807
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
Okay.

808
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Your Highness.

809
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Lord Ning hasn't finished talking yet.

810
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Lord Lu, please stop talking.

811
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Why haven't you given up on this idea?

812
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Lord Ning, I know that this is indeed a strong woman.

813
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Your Highness, I...

814
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,400
But you see, after you talked to Marquis Changjing,

815
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Marquis Changjing's attitude towards me has changed a lot.

816
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Lord Ning, if in the future,

817
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Miss Ru Yi can talk to Marquis Changjing more,

818
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,400
maybe Marquis Changjing can persuade the king of Anguo

819
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
to release the emperor.

820
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
But Ru Yi is not from the Sixth Hall.

821
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Lord Ning, please forgive me for being straightforward.

822
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,400
I can see your feelings for Miss Ru Yi.

823
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Women should have three virtues.

824
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Besides, Miss Ru Yi is a swordsman.

825
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,400
If you go and ask her to talk to Marquis Changjing,

826
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,400
I think she might not be upset.

827
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Your Highness.

828
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Your Highness.

829
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
Your Highness.

830
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Your Highness.

831
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Your Highness.
