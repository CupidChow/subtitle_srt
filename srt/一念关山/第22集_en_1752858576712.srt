1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Dervern – Though It Wounds

2
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,500
The wind, fire, shadow, frost, sky, snow, color, and the sunset

3
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Love, night, and peace are all in the daily life

4
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
The beauty of the eyes, the frost, frost, and frost are all hidden

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
The melody of the zither, the sound of the flute, the song of the zither, the hair of the green hair

6
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
The good fortune and the good injury

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Whisper to the wind and summer, none leaves or Creator

8
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Held theTalk with care and now I will talk differently

9
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
The sky is shining under brothers

10
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Whisper to wind and year, now I will dug open my soul

11
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,260
Wishing the path and life to the same

12
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,820
Here we go again, fifty a-hundred-頭, sharing the same

13
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,700
alcohol,

14
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,320
and

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,780
also

16
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:59,540
appetite

17
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,340
Such a good

18
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,980
move

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:33,980
obviously

20
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,980
This money is enough for you.

21
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,980
Never look for it again.

22
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,980
This is a state of emergency.

23
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,980
There are often beasts in the city.

24
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,980
The princess is really good.

25
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,980
You don't follow the delegation to rest,

26
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,980
and come here alone?

27
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,980
You opened this mountain.

28
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,980
You planted this tree.

29
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,980
Why can't I come here?

30
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,980
Wait.

31
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,980
I just want to say

32
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,980
that the morning in Bianzhou is not bad.

33
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,980
Princess, wait for me.

34
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
Wait.

35
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Princess, I'm sorry.

36
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
You're still so greedy.

37
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
It's not me.

38
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
It's my master.

39
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,980
He likes to eat this.

40
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Really?

41
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
He said he used to practice martial arts here.

42
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,980
So I want to pick some.

43
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
When I get to the Yuzhou,

44
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,980
I can put it in front of his grave and worship him.

45
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,980
Your master is buried in Yuzhou?

46
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,980
He's buried in Andu.

47
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Because he's a good person.

48
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,980
He's a good person.

49
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
He's a good person.

50
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Because I've been fighting everywhere these years,

51
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm always worried that I can't get back on the first day.

52
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
So I've seen his online ranking

53
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
in the names of all the states.

54
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
So I can get anywhere.

55
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
Don't say so much to me.

56
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
I don't want to be treated as your master's substitute.

57
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,980
I just

59
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,980
have a little bit of confidence.

60
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,980
But

61
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,980
if your master is in heaven,

62
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
he'll be happy to see you smile like this.

63
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,980
Really?

64
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
Really.

65
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,980
Try it.

66
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Try it.

67
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
I never eat these wild food.

68
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
I didn't eat it because

69
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
my master likes to eat.

70
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
Thank you.

71
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
Thank you for what you said to me.

72
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Try one. It's really sweet.

73
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Try one.

74
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Not bad.

75
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
I think

76
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,980
you and King Li are not sensible.

77
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Is it tiring to take care of him?

78
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,980
From Shengzhou to Wudu,

79
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
how long will it take?

80
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Are you testing me?

81
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
No, no.

82
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
I just want to

83
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
talk to you more.

84
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
Chang Qing Heng,

85
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980
you know Zhang Yu Ling Wei.

86
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Our emperor is your subordinate.

87
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
You were a loser.

88
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
You were even more humiliating to me.

89
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Now you're acting like a young man.

90
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
What happened before

91
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
was really my own trick.

92
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Princess,

94
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
you smile like

95
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
my master.

96
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,980
But

97
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
you never care about me these days.

98
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Why should I be nice to you?

99
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Yuan Zhou was hurt so badly

100
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
just to save you.

101
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,980
He helped you, but you hurt him with food.

102
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Princess,

103
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,980
you should know

104
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,980
what Lord Ning told me that night.

105
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
I think so.

106
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,980
He's right.

107
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
But I was too strict.

108
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
So

109
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
I was so uncertain.

110
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
I was so worried.

111
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
So I came out

112
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
to have a rest.

113
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,980
Princess,

114
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,980
should I listen to him?

115
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
You asked me?

116
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
I have the same idea as him.

117
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
I won't help you make any decision.

118
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,980
But I can promise you

119
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,980
that Yuan Zhou is a person

120
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,980
who knows the graces.

121
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,980
You saved his life before.

122
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,980
He won't hurt you.

123
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,980
And Yuan Zhou is a man of evil.

124
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,980
You can not believe his conclusion.

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,980
But his analysis of politics

126
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,980
is absolutely wrong.

127
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,980
You really believe him.

128
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
He's a man I chose.

129
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,980
I believe him.

130
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
I don't think so.

131
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
I can't eat the cake anymore.

132
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
My hands are shaking.

133
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
It's dangerous to shoot.

134
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
You can eat it.

135
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,980
It's better.

136
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Look.

137
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Princess, you can keep this.

138
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Forget it.

140
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Eat two cakes.

141
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Eat three.

142
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm not worried about you.

143
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Sister.

144
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Let me see.

145
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Where did you get this?

146
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
So beautiful.

147
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Thank you, my lord.

148
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980
You haven't eaten it, have you?

149
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Let them wash it first.

150
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Okay.

151
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
I'll wait for you in the car.

152
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Brother Hou.

153
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Are you crazy?

154
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
I brought it here.

155
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
What?

156
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Can't I take it off?

157
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
I'll go.

158
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Sister.

159
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Li Chongguo.

160
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
What did you do to the prince?

161
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
I just hit some straws.

162
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
What?

163
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
Is he a treasure?

164
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Why does everyone touch him?

165
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
I don't like him.

166
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
You're an adult.

167
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
It's none of your business.

168
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
You're still a kid.

169
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Wait.

170
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
What?

171
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
I've made up my mind.

172
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
You've made up your mind?

173
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
You can't take it.

174
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
From now on,

175
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
I'll help you to win back your master.

176
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
But you still can't agree

177
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
to stay away from our princess, right?

178
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Lord Ning.

179
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Don't be so cruel.

180
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Although I'm only 22 years old,

181
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
in this world,

182
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,980
there's no time

183
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
to make me happy.

184
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
What does that have to do with me?

185
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
To show my sincerity to work with you,

186
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
I can tell you something.

187
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Did the six Taoist churches

188
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
arrange some people to protect your master?

189
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
When I took your master,

190
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,980
some people died on the spot.

191
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,980
You mean Chai Ming and others?

192
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,980
That guard leader is indeed Chai.

193
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,980
According to the order of the loyal army,

194
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,980
I should have thrown them into the river.

195
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
I think they're loyal too.

196
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
They shouldn't fall into the ground of the dead.

197
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
So, I asked Zhu Yin to send people

198
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,980
to dig some shallow pits at night

199
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
and bury them on the shallow beach.

200
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,980
Where are they now?

201
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Not far from here.

202
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
If it's fast,

203
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,980
you'll see them soon.

204
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Let's go.

205
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
I found it!

206
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
It's here!

207
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Xiao Yu.

208
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
It's Shi Xiao Yu!

209
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
When Wu Mingzhi and Xiao Zhi

210
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
were chasing the big thief Shen Jiayan,

211
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
he was beheaded!

212
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
I recognize him!

213
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
This is Luo Yan.

214
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
He has a long history of being beheaded.

215
00:13:36,980 --> 00:14:00,720
He often eats the

216
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Ming.

217
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,980
I'll take you home.

218
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Brother Qian, he...

219
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
That's Chai Ming.

220
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
When Chai Ming was working in the palace,

221
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
he was the best friend of Qian.

222
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,880
Gr�

223
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
It's a Prolenatic retired movie.

224
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,860
Can't wait.

225
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:01,100
Brook broughtστ

226
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
A soul has stolen.

227
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,500
Wutu Hanlei

228
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,840
Cong spree

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,260
gerberation

230
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,820
Your Highness

231
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,920
They are Thunder Pandas who died for you

232
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,100
There may be a place for them at the grandparents' in theworking day

233
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,100
THE black following ox

234
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I'll beendes and strong and always north

235
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Entire level threat

236
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:13,100
I killed this Korean man to avenge my brothers in heaven!

237
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
I killed him!

238
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
I killed the whole battlefield!

239
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
It's not my fault, it's the enemy's fault!

240
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
It's not their fate!

241
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Everyone!

242
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,100
We can find the bones of our brothers in heaven

243
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
and bring their ashes home.

244
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
We must thank Chang Qinglu for all this.

245
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
The war between the two countries has been going on for a long time.

246
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Now, we must work together with him

247
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
to really end the war.

248
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
I will not let you go.

249
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
I will not let you go.

250
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Only then can we really end the war,

251
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
build a new sword,

252
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,100
and return the people to a longer peace.

253
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Do you understand?

254
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Yes!

255
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Let's go!

256
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Let's go to the Garden of the Noble.

257
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Go!

258
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
The flight attendants have killed 29 people.

259
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,100
The police are afraid that the traitors of the Wudu Branch are doing the same thing.

260
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
This cruel criminal is cunning.

261
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
He may have sneaked into our security.

262
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Those who obey this order should be killed immediately.

263
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Do not leave any alive people.

264
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Do not leave any alive people?

265
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
The headquarters has been sending out such a suspicious order recently.

266
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
They will transfer some experts from our side

267
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
and say that they will carry out some secret mission.

268
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
They will also send a hot-handed Shanyu here.

269
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
This Ruyi Yi Ren is so powerful.

270
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,100
The Flying and Single Wings Envoys are all in his hands.

271
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
What can I, a Purple Wings Envoys, do?

272
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Should I let him die?

273
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Sir, the urgent letter from the Garden of the Noble.

274
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
The Wudu Branch has already arrived at the Garden of the Noble.

275
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
This is too fast.

276
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Send the flying pigeon immediately.

277
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Yes!

278
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Go!

279
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
As expected.

280
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,100
The headquarters does not know that you are a human being.

281
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,100
They only know that the killer of the case is Ruyi.

282
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
It does not mention the assassination of Li Tongguang.

283
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Let him go back to the capital and investigate it.

284
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
By the way,

285
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,100
I have seen you have been teaching A-Ying these days.

286
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I have not heard you mention

287
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
how to take revenge when you arrive in Angu.

288
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
I know what I am doing.

289
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
But do not interfere in this matter.

290
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
I...

291
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Do not worry.

292
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
You have your own things to do.

293
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
I will take care of Zhu Yi Wei's things.

294
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,100
If you cannot do it, it is not worth it to ask for your help.

295
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
All right.

296
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
But I still have to thank you.

297
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
For accompanying me to the memorial service.

298
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
It is all right.

299
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
They are your brothers.

300
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
I will accompany you to send them off.

301
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
I will not have any worries.

302
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
And...

303
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
I am very envious of them.

304
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Envious of them?

305
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Yuan Xiaolu said

306
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,100
that the six sects will use this kind of power every year

307
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
to commemorate their dead brothers.

308
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Zhu Yi Wei does not have such a habit.

309
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
The dead Wei Zhong

310
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
will be sent to the Huaren City

311
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
without any reason.

312
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
There will be no tomb, no spirit.

313
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Let alone the incense and fire.

314
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Let's burn incense and fire together.

315
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Then when we arrive at An Du,

316
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
if you want to worship them,

317
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
I will accompany you.

318
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
It is a pity

319
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,100
that I did not even remember their real names.

320
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
When Zhu Yi Wei was alive,

321
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
he only had a code, no real name.

322
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
His appearance, personality, and family background

323
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
will be recorded in detail

324
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
in case someone escapes.

325
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
But once he dies,

326
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
he will be taken down by the list.

327
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
It seems that these people

328
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
have never existed.

329
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
But what makes me sad is

330
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
that I did not feel anything wrong

331
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
in doing this before.

332
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
Only then did I realize

333
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,100
that they were also worth being commemorated.

334
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
You only know how to eat soup?

335
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
I was in An Du

336
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
when I was a child.

337
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I was a little girl.

338
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
I was a little girl.

339
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
I was a little girl.

340
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
I was once in An Du.

341
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
If you need help with Zhu Yi Wei,

342
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
you must tell me.

343
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
What did you do

344
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
when you were in An Du?

345
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
I remember now.

346
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Qian Zhao asked me to discuss the matter of the back door.

347
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Let's go back quickly.

348
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
You have not answered me yet.

349
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

350
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
That side is more urgent.

351
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
I want to talk about Qian Zhao's matter.

352
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Brother 13,

353
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
I have been asking Brother Yuan Zhou for a long time

354
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
but he is not willing to tell me.

355
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
What was his profession when he was in An Du?

356
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
He used to be...

357
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
I am not familiar with him.

358
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,100
I will ask Yuan Lu.

359
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
You cannot tell me.

360
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
You cannot tell me.

361
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
If you tell me, you will have to kill me.

362
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
Me?

363
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
I have not added Zhu Yi Wei yet.

364
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
No, Sixth Dao Hall.

365
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Turn around.

366
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Your Highness really wants to know?

367
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
The contract...

368
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
cannot be told.

369
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Fine. You all are hiding it from me.

370
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
I am sorry.

371
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Chang Qing Hong, what do you want to do?

372
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
I am lost.

373
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
I am here to find you.

374
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
What is it?

375
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
I have a report.

376
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
The bridge tower in front of the main road.

377
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
We should go to the mountain road.

378
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
When we cross this mountain, you can see An Du.

379
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
The bridge tower.

380
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
That is An Du.

381
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Do you think I can take my brother

382
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
and leave this place?

383
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I think so.

384
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
I...

385
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
I...

386
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
I...

387
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Your Highness,

388
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
you do not like the scenery.

389
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Go and give the guests

390
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
some gifts.

391
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
Yes.

392
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Go.

393
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Go.

394
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Go.

395
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
It looks like when the prince entered the city,

396
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
he was more powerful than his brother.

397
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Yes.

398
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
I can take you to An Du.

399
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
I can hand over the seal.

400
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Please stay in the temple.

401
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
The Honglu Temple

402
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
will come every three days.

403
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
If you need anything,

404
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
just ask him.

405
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Wait.

406
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
What do you mean by three days?

407
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Shouldn't the king

408
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
summon me right away?

409
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
You know

410
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
that the emperor

411
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
wants to see you.

412
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
He wants to see me?

413
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
He will see me.

414
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
He will see me.

415
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
He will see me.

416
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Goodbye.

417
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Many people in the Imperial Guards know my master.

418
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
Be careful.

419
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
I really do not like this Chang Qing Heng.

420
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
He has a good face

421
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
and is always

422
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
cold and cold.

423
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
I do not like him either.

424
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
But now

425
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,100
we cooperate with him privately.

426
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
He will secretly come to report to us.

427
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
Just now

428
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
it was the usual measure

429
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
of the first state to welcome the envoy.

430
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
I was cold and angry.

431
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
This is normal.

432
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
I was wrong.

433
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Then, Lord Ning,

434
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
when will the king

435
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
see me?

436
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
At least three or five days.

437
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
But do not worry.

438
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
We are tired all the way.

439
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
We also need to rest for a while.

440
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Brothers,

441
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
follow me to pull the nails in the yard.

442
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
Yes.

443
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
What?

444
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
You let the king enter the palace at midnight?

445
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
Yes.

446
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
The king just fell asleep.

447
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
We are under the order of the emperor.

448
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
What?

449
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
What happened?

450
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Your Highness,

451
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
the spies from the palace of the An State have come to pass the order.

452
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
His Majesty's order

453
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
is that the king of Wu State

454
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
will enter the palace

455
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
to meet him immediately.

456
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
It is not

457
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
three o'clock yet.

458
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
It is five o'clock in the morning.

459
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
There are many officials in the court

460
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
at three o'clock.

461
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
You...

462
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
Did you not even give a decree

463
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
to summon the king of our country?

464
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,100
What?

465
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Did not hear clearly?

466
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
His Majesty's order is not in the imperial decree.

467
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
You do not want to be summoned, do you?

468
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Then I will go back to the palace

469
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
and report to you.

470
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Wait.

471
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
You dare to speak in person?

472
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
Then I will wait

473
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
for you in the palace.

474
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Let us go.

475
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
This...

476
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
This An Oren

477
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
is too rude.

478
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
He thinks of such a way to torture the king.

479
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
On the way here,

480
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
everyone has helped me several times.

481
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
I have prepared

482
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
to enter the palace at any time.

483
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Quickly bring the gift

484
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
for sending Andie here.

485
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Okay. Everyone, prepare quickly

486
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
to accompany the prince to enter the palace.

487
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
The court has ordered

488
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,100
that all other officials

489
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,100
are allowed to enter the palace.

490
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,100
No guards are allowed to accompany the prince.

491
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
What did you say?

492
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
This is my personal personal matter.

493
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
This is the national gift

494
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
and the imperial decree for your country.

495
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Your Highness,

496
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
we are all waiting for you outside.

497
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Wait.

498
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Don't panic.

499
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Don't panic.

500
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Calm down.

501
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Think about why they did this.

502
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Did something happen?

503
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
The upper city asked us to give him a lower guard.

504
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
What if...

505
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Open the door and see what's going on.

506
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Quickly help me up.

507
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Where is he?

508
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Where is he?

509
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
There was something just now.

510
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Where did he go?

511
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Yes, he saw a ghost.

512
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Who?

513
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
What are you looking for?

514
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
I have waited for a long time.

515
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,100
Hurry up and lead the way.

516
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Hurry up.

517
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
It's a spy.

518
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
I have made a promise to you.

519
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
If you enter the palace safely,

520
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
I will let the spy out.

521
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Okay.

522
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
I hope you can successfully meet Andi.

523
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
The first level has passed.

524
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
The next level will definitely go well.

525
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Okay.

526
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Let's go.

527
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
I will wait for you.

528
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
The door is open.

529
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
I can breathe.

530
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Yes.

531
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Beipan?

532
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
It's been decades.

533
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
The Northern Pan tribe has not been in trouble.

534
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Why is it at this time

535
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
that we have to fight against Chu?

536
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
It's not the time to fight against Chu.

537
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Why is it at this time that we have to fight against Chu?

538
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
It's a trouble for us.

539
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
I don't have so much free military power

540
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
to transfer to Tianmen Pass.

541
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
You give those three bodies to the Ministry of Justice

542
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
to identify them.

543
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
At most, let the northern sand

544
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
keep an eye on it.

545
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
That's enough.

546
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
What's the matter?

547
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Your Majesty?

548
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Yang Ying is still waiting in the side hall.

549
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Yang Ying is still waiting in the side hall.

550
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
He is quite patient

551
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
at such a young age.

552
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
He should keep waiting.

553
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
He should keep waiting.

554
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
Let him wait

555
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
until I finish the meeting

556
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
and finish my dinner.

557
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Let him wait until I finish my dinner.

558
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
I'll make him pay.

559
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Continue.

560
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Yes.

561
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
The first assailant I've attacked,

562
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,100
I suspect is Zhu Yiwei.

563
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
What?

564
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
I didn't believe it.

565
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
After all, Zhu Yiwei is the Emperor's personal soldier.

566
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
It's only that you're more loyal.

567
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Enough.

568
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Give me the evidence.

569
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Your Highness,

570
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
don't you want to ask His Majesty when he will announce the edict?

571
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,100
My brother, Regent, is very busy.

572
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm sure the King of your country is the same.

573
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
When he has time,

574
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
he will meet me.

575
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Why should I be anxious?

576
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Your Highness, please have a seat.

577
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
No need.

578
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,100
My brother lives in a high tower.

579
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,100
I don't think there's such a elegant tea ceremony.

580
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
How can I imagine?

581
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
Besides,

582
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,100
if you use this tea ceremony,

583
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,100
if you waste time,

584
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,100
I'm afraid you'll be in a bad shape.

585
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Isn't that like your wish?

586
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:53,020
A river 내

587
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,300
We're not being değ för kksjys

588
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
They triangular

589
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,300
il

590
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,840
ok

591
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,840
Lordaire has a message for you.

592
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,800
Last week...

593
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,260
you had a match with his Didn't you In my agent's room,

594
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,780
Prepared some divorce papers,

595
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:39,760
Government blood

596
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Your Highness.

597
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
It's been a whole day.

598
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
The Lord finally showed up.

599
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I was busy reporting to the Ministry of Rites

600
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
about all the matters.

601
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
I didn't mean to be late.

602
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Please forgive me.

603
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
But Your Highness, you are not allowed to go out of the palace.

604
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Not allowed to go out?

605
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Your Highness, you are busy with official affairs.

606
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,760
I will leave now and come back tomorrow.

607
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
What's wrong with that?

608
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Does Your Highness know that the Lord is not here?

609
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,760
You don't even allow guests to leave?

610
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Does Your Highness not only mean to make things difficult for me,

611
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,760
but also prepared a red-robed banquet?

612
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
Your Highness.

613
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
Your Highness!

614
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Step aside.

615
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Your Highness.

616
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Why are you so rude?

617
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Your Highness.

618
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Your Highness.

619
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,760
I have asked the eunuch to report to His Majesty.

620
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Please take care of him.

621
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,760
You are so nervous.

622
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,760
Are you worried that I won't come back once I leave?

623
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Don't worry.

624
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,760
I will come back tomorrow.

625
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
But it's only three days.

626
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
If within three days,

627
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I still haven't received a clear answer

628
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,760
about the matter of the camp,

629
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,760
I will immediately return to my country.

630
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
I am a free-spirited Prince,

631
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
so I don't want to be involved in official affairs.

632
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
No matter which of my brothers is in the throne,

633
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I am still the Prince.

634
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Also,

635
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
you'd better not think that

636
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
as long as you keep me under control,

637
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
you can get that 100,000 taels of gold for nothing.

638
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
After all,

639
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
the six halls

640
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
will not be spared

641
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
the hundreds of dead people

642
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
who are wandering in your country.

643
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
You can guard against it for one and a half months,

644
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,760
but you can also guard against it for three years and five years.

645
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Your Highness.

646
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
Please.

647
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Your Highness.

648
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Your Highness.

649
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Your Highness.

650
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
Who are you scared of?

651
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,760
You have no regrets.

652
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Once you were with me,

653
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,760
the spring breeze blew away.

654
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,760
The past year is the rain,

655
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,760
the spring is the rain.

656
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,760
When will spring wind come and make you cry?

657
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Who drinks a cup of wind and snow,

658
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,760
and falls into the dust?

659
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Who sighs for a moment and gets drunk?

660
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,760
The sky is scattered like water,

661
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,760
looking back at the past and the future.

662
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,760
The world is like a glass of wine.

663
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,760
Who will stay for the rest of his life?

664
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,760
Who is worried about the future?

665
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Who is afraid that his dreams will be in vain

666
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,760
and will only come back for the wind?

667
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,760
The world is like a glass of snow.

668
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,760
How many years have passed?

669
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Who will stay for the rest of his life?
