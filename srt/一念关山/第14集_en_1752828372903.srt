00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The

00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,120
the

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
the

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
the

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,120
the

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,120
the

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,120
the

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,120
the

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,120
the

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,120
the

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,120
the

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:40,120
the

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,120
the

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,120
the

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,120
the

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,120
The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,340
The

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,340
beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,340
The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,340
The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,340
The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,340
The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,340
The beauty is in the wind and frost, where is the peace?

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,340
It's been so many favorites, it was very challenging.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,340
thank you.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,260
Thank you.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,300
Thank you, thank you.

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,060
That's good.

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,820
That's good, you did a great job.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,340
Thanks, you are great.

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,440
You helped pretty well.

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,040
Hey, come enjoy some drinks.

33
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,480
What did you say?

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,760
The End

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,560
Knee dancer

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Mission accomplished!

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Brother Lang.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Little girl.

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
She's in a hurry.

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
What did I tell you?

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm a man of character.

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
I'm not good at holding a sword.

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
But I'm a man of character.

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
But I'm a man of character.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
But I'm a man of character.

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Now is not the time for Xia Meng to ask.

48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
When she wants it,

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
let's let her make it better.

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
The taste is fragrant enough.

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
What is it?

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
I must be crazy.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
That's why I'm messing with you here.

54
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Life is full of happiness.

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,480
End of youth, empty moon.

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
My youth has passed.

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
What's the use of the moon?

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Okay, sit down.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Let's get down to business.

60
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
There's a new chief in Jin Sha House.

61
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Let's think about how to talk to him.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Okay.

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Ruyi hasn't come down.

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Why did she kill Yue San Niang?

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Chu has sent people to kill her.

66
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,480
What do they want to do?

67
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Go and investigate.

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,480
Find out all the people who have dealt with Ruyi.

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Yes.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Yes.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
The letters and the letters of the six halls.

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Of course.

73
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
What do you want to write?

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
This letter.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
I need you to help me with it.

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
I sent it out a month ago.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Something was delayed.

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
I sent it to Yu Lang's house these days.

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Yu Lang? Who?

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Yue San Niang's lover.

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Ling Long's fiance.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Just open it.

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Since I'm asking you to do it,

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
I don't want to hide it from you.

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
October 15th.

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
He Xian Qing Feng Guan.

87
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Ruyi.

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Do you want to use this fake letter

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,480
to lure the people of the Zhu Yi Wei to find you?

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
The man named Zhu Ji's flying dress

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
knows the inside of the story.

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
I want to force him to ask.

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
But I'm afraid it will affect his group.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Fortunately, I'll lure him to

95
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,480
the He Xian near the border of the two countries of Wu An.

96
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Okay.

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
I'll go right now.

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
I'll go right now.

99
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
When we get to the Jin Sha building,

100
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
we'll do everything in a hurry.

101
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Okay.

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
There must be his news channel on the 13th floor.

103
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
What's wrong?

104
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Mr. Du.

105
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
You slipped and your waist is fluttering.

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
If you have a stomachache, you have to lie down and rest.

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Mr. Fu, go back and rest.

108
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
No, no.

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
General Guo is coming.

110
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm anxious to go and see him.

111
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Let His Highness go and see him.

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
He can now be on his own.

113
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
No.

114
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
General Guo is here to send the Empress a secret letter.

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
It's about King Dan Yao.

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
His Highness is not going back alone.

117
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
No one can see you like this now.

118
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
How about this?

119
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Mr. Ying.

120
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
You have the sword and the jade pendant in your hand.

121
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
You go for me.

122
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Please.

123
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Okay.

124
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Please go back, Mr. Fu.

125
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Okay.

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
What about the Jin Sha building when you go to see General Guo?

127
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Shisan.

128
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
You came just in time.

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
What's wrong?

130
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Shisan has been helping me with this.

131
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
How about this?

132
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
You pretend to be me and go to the Jin Sha building.

133
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Then I'll be the Hall Leader of Bianchen.

134
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
I'll be a good swordsman.

135
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
It's a deal.

136
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
I'll do it.

137
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Don't worry.

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Can you be at ease just like that?

139
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Be careful.

140
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
How about this?

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Why are you dressed like this?

142
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Welcome, sir.

143
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I love you.

144
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
The best wine in the world.

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Drink with me later.

146
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Thank you, sir.

147
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Sir, what's in there?

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
He doesn't need it.

149
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Don't be so rude.

150
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
It's the natural reaction of the body.

151
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
There's no way.

152
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Cheers.

153
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
The white porcelain of Xingyao.

154
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Not bad.

155
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Purple bamboo shoots in Huzhou.

156
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Really not bad.

157
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
South Lake.

158
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
It's really not bad.

159
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Then please have a taste first.

160
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Our Hall Leader Jin will be here in a minute.

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Thank you.

162
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,480
They actually sent the South Lake water here to make tea.

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
It's a taste of the master.

164
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Drink more.

165
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Be serious.

166
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
It's a woman.

167
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
She drank too much.

168
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Who's looking for me?

169
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Six Halls' Ning Mao.

170
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,480
It's an honor to meet you today.

171
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Ning.

172
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
You're here.

173
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I'm here.

174
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
I'm here.

175
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm here.

176
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Ning.

177
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Your surname is Ning.

178
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Of course my surname is Ning.

179
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
The one who killed the mother of the master, Fang Yifeng Liu,

180
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,480
and the other people.

181
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Why don't you say that you've never seen your family before

182
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,480
and only feel like you've met them before?

183
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
I really want to say this.

184
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
How do you know?

185
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
I have...

186
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
The chief of the gang is a big and powerful gang.

187
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
But all of them are not ordinary people.

188
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Ning Mao wouldn't dare to make a mistake.

189
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Okay.

190
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Well said.

191
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
What are you doing?

192
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Sing and dance.

193
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Is there a problem?

194
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Why is it this way?

195
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
You're not the most popular one, right?

196
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
How do I know?

197
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
It's useless.

198
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Forget it.

199
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Let's make them happy first.

200
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Hurry up.

201
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Welcome to the capital.

202
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
You must be tired.

203
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
It's okay.

204
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,480
The empress asked me to take good care of you in the capital.

205
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Meow.

206
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Meow.

207
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Chief of the gang, please.

208
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,480
It's my pleasure to let you smile.

209
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Why don't we have a drink?

210
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
It's refreshing.

211
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Since you've drunk and danced,

212
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,480
are you interested in talking about the political affairs?

213
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Go ahead.

214
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
I want to know

215
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,480
whether the two of you are in the capital.

216
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
You're so kind to me

217
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,480
just to get information.

218
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,480
I'm a leader of the six hall.

219
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
As the leader of the six hall,

220
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
I have to...

221
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Meow.

222
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
I've heard it all night.

223
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Chief of the gang, what do you mean?

224
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
You can't joke like that.

225
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Yun Shisan, look at me seriously.

226
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
You really don't remember who I am?

227
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Meiniang.

228
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
You're Meiniang?

229
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
You look so happy.

230
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
This...

231
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
This is great.

232
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
I miss you so much.

233
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I can't forget you every day.

234
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Wrong.

235
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
You ran away the next day.

236
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
You forgot me so cleanly.

237
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Meiniang, this is a misunderstanding.

238
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Listen to me.

239
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
From that day on, I...

240
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Hurry up.

241
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
From that day on, I...

244
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Hurry up.

245
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Old man, run!

246
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Where do you think you're going this time?

247
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Run!

248
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Run!

249
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Watch out!

250
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Old man!

251
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Chief of the gang, he ran away.

252
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
What should we do?

253
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Let's see where he can go.

254
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
What?

255
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
We've known each other for so many years.

256
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
You don't believe me?

257
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
I really did nothing.

258
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
When I saved him, he was so angry.

259
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
I even praised him as the most beautiful girl in the world.

260
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
How many days did you stay there?

261
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Three days.

262
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
How did you leave?

263
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
He said he was going to marry me.

264
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,480
I ran away that night.

265
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
I even left him money and a jade pendant.

266
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
I even left him a jade pendant.

267
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I even left him a jade pendant.

268
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
I even left him a jade pendant.

269
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
I even left him money and a jade pendant.

270
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
I even left him a love letter.

271
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Wait.

272
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
You're just dressed like this?

273
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
What's wrong with your hair?

274
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
You're dressed like this.

275
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
You went out and told people you were Ning Yuan Zhou?

276
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
This...

277
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
This is so pretty.

278
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
What's pretty?

279
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
You're ruining my reputation. Do you understand?

280
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Okay, I don't care about your stupid things.

281
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
But now is the time to find the money.

282
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Tao.

283
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
The chief of Jinsha Gang sent someone to deliver a message.

284
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Let him in.

285
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Yes.

286
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Please.

287
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Dear officials,

288
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Chief Jin asked me to deliver a message.

289
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Unless we use the head of Yu Shi San.

290
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Otherwise, our Jinsha House will not mind

291
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,480
keeping that money forever.

292
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I'll ask the former official to come.

293
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Oh, right.

294
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Our chief has been in a bad mood recently.

295
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
So, the next time he comes,

296
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
it might not be me.

297
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,480
It's the former official's finger or eyes.

298
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Goodbye.

299
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
What are you looking at?

300
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
I'm not going.

301
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
I finally came back.

302
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
What's with your expression?

303
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Didn't you hear what he said?

304
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
He wants my...

305
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Enough. Shut up, Wei Yu Shi San.

306
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Watch this.

307
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
I'll go with Shi San.

308
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Don't worry.

309
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Yuan Lu, take the things.

310
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes.

311
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
I'm not going.

312
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
You're making trouble every day.

313
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Ruyi,

314
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
why don't you go out and have a look?

315
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
If something happens,

316
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
they'll come to me.

317
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Since they didn't come,

318
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
why should I be so selfish?

319
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Ruyi,

320
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
why are you so nice to me?

321
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Although you always said

322
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
you made a deal with Brother Yuan Zhou

323
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
before coming to my class,

324
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
but you're still the daughter-in-law

325
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
of the Gu family,

326
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Pei Ni Guan, Ming Nv Shi.

327
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I've had several masters.

328
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
I know that

329
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
you've done

330
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,480
much more than them.

331
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Maybe

332
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm not good to my previous land.

333
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
So I feel guilty.

334
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
Pei Ni Guan taught you?

335
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Tell me

336
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
what kind of person he is.

337
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,280
The Black

338
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Holy light

339
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,460
Soul

340
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Location

341
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Son

342
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Go get thoseallow紀h.

343
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Hold on!

344
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
I'll show you!

345
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Let her go!

346
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
No!

347
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
I, Ning, greet Chief Jin.

348
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Which Ning again?

349
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Six Taoist Monks, Ning Yuan Zhou.

350
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Chief wants to keep my brother as a guest.

351
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
In case he still needs some fire.

352
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Good, good, good.

353
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,480
You're indeed the famous Ning Yuan Zhou.

354
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Six Taoist Monks, Ning Yuan Zhou.

355
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Chief Ning is so cruel.

356
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Aren't you afraid that I won't cooperate with Six Taoist Monks?

357
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
If the whole world knows that the Golden Sand Sect is against Six Taoist Monks,

358
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
you should be the one to be afraid.

359
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

360
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

361
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

362
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

363
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

364
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

365
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

366
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

367
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm afraid that I won't be able to protect you.

368
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,480
I may not be able to protect you.

369
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:29,780
But I'll protect you no matter what.

370
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,480
No one can ever protect me.

371
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
As long as you earth is in my hands.

372
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,480
I'll protect you if you will have to pay my taxes.

373
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Thanks.

374
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,600
Do you want to know about those royal and state affairs?

375
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,040
I can tell you.

376
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
That's great.

377
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Yuan Lu.

378
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,120
I believe these treasures

379
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,840
are enough to exchange for a message from the new chief.

380
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,920
Am I lacking money?

381
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,280
I'm lacking...

382
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
people.

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,200
As long as you are willing to be my sister's guest,

384
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,120
I can give you any message for free.

385
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
If you agree,

386
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
the grudge between me and Yu Shi San

387
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,000
can be a joke from now on.

388
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,640
Chen Jiao!

389
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Shut up!

390
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,120
How is it?

391
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,160
Sorry.

392
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm not here to tell you.

393
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Sorry for the trouble.

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,200
Then you never want to know about those messages.

395
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,080
You are not the only one who can send me messages.

396
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Goodbye.

397
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Ning Yuan Zhou

398
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,200
and Pei Jiuniang are engaged?

399
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,280
I heard it from the palace.

400
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,560
I don't think it's right.

401
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
But they must have changed their minds.

402
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,880
Something bad happened.

403
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,440
Something bad happened.

404
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,760
Chief Jin Xiaobao

405
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,800
is thinking about it.

406
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
He wants to get rid of Mingnan.

407
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Do you think these two people

408
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,400
can stop me?

409
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,160
But as long as my men stop you,

410
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,040
at least I can delay your classes.

411
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,520
This is enough for the people of the Zhu Yi Division

412
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,640
to get my message

413
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
and find your King Li.

414
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,920
King Li will be heavily guarded when he goes out.

415
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
But...

416
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,720
Chief Jin,

417
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,760
are you sure you want to be the enemy of Liudatang?

418
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,240
The news of Jin Xiaobao is spreading.

419
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,800
I'm fine with it.

420
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,440
But I have more interest

421
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
in your Sen Luo Palace.

422
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,800
I do want to cooperate with Chief Jin.

423
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,440
But not in this way.

424
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,680
I don't want you to marry me.

425
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,680
As long as you and I can have a little bit of fun.

426
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,400
It won't hurt you.

427
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,440
Meiniang, you finally figured it out.

428
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
So you know why I suddenly...

429
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Shut up.

430
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,040
Tell me.

431
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Why don't you want to?

432
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,040
Because my child's mother

433
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,560
will be unhappy.

434
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Who is your child's mother?

435
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,080
If she is unhappy,

436
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,280
I'll kill her.

437
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
I'll see who dares to kill me.

438
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
How can you talk to him like that?

439
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Your Majesty.

440
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
It's really you.

441
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Your Majesty.

442
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,680
I finally see you again.

443
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
You are Linglong?

444
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Yang Xingyuan, you finally eat something.

445
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,680
You have done a great job.

446
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
I don't dare to do that.

447
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
I and Chief of Honglu Temple

448
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
sing only the song of red face

449
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
and white face.

450
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Get up.

451
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

452
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
When Wu Di was being planted in Yongan Tower,

453
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,680
should he continue to follow King Hedong's order?

454
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
All of them should be given to me.

455
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
I don't want to see you again.

456
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
I still want to follow King Hedong's order

457
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
and continue to do so.

458
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
All of them should be given to me.

459
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:36,660
Yang Xingyuan's one-way

460
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
How can I take Wu State?

461
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
In the following few battles,

462
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
I still hope that King Li will send

463
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,680
100,000 taels of gold.

464
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Look at what happened to Yang Xingyuan.

465
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
I can't let them continue to do it.

466
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Chen Dehui.

467
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Tongguang,

468
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
since you have a lot of experience

469
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
in receiving Wu State,

470
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
then you should be the

471
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
one who can do it.

472
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
I didn't expect that.

474
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
But that's the way it is.

475
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
If it wasn't for that old man

476
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
who worked so hard to get me,

477
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,680
from last night until now,

478
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
there are so many things to talk about

479
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
in one night.

480
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
If it wasn't for the fact that

481
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Brother Qian worked so hard yesterday,

482
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
I wouldn't have come.

483
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Then go back.

484
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Is there anyone?

485
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Someone who came to Huzhou to make purple bamboo shoots

486
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
and soaked them in Nailin water.

487
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Enough.

488
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
They haven't seen each other for a long time.

489
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
There must be a lot of private things to talk about.

490
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Wait a little longer.

491
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Then why are you still so clumsy

492
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
and haven't changed your clothes?

493
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
How am I clumsy?

494
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
It's sour.

495
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Is it sour? I'll try it.

496
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Ning Wenzhou, come in.

497
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Okay.

498
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Now they are our own people.

499
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
We are outsiders.

500
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
What can't we know?

501
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
We'll know when we get back.

502
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Brother Qian, have some chess.

503
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Yuan Lu, eat more.

504
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Thank you.

505
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Thank you, brother.

506
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Brother 13, you eat.

507
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Master Ning, I have offended you

508
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,680
for being so rude before.

509
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,680
Please forgive me.

510
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
You don't have to be so polite.

511
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,680
You are my friend.

512
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I have to be polite to you.

513
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
You are Ruyi's colleague.

514
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Of course you don't have to be polite.

515
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Sit.

516
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Sit.

517
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
I didn't have time to tell you last night.

518
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Meiniang is the flying doctor

519
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
I brought from Baique.

520
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Her name was Linglang.

521
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Now her name is Jin Meiniang.

522
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I mentioned it to you before.

523
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
She helped me escape from the prison.

524
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Thank you, Chief Jin.

525
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I don't deserve your praise.

526
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I was brought out

527
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
from the dead team.

528
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I am willing to serve you.

529
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,680
But you managed to

530
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
run a big business in Jinsha House.

531
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
I admire you.

532
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
It's just my luck.

533
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
After you left Kandu,

534
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
the Guards were chasing me.

535
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I was so embarrassed

536
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,680
that I saved my life.

537
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Then I met Old Sha.

538
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
He treated me well.

539
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
He helped me to get a new face.

540
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
I changed my appearance.

541
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
I married him

542
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
because of the name of Jinsha.

543
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Three years ago, he went to the old business.

544
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Everyone pushed me to be the successor.

545
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
I wonder why Jinsha House

546
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
suddenly changed its name.

547
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
The flying doctor's method is different.

548
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
It's all thanks to your teachings.

549
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
I only know how to kill.

550
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
I can't teach you these.

551
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,680
You have your own skills

552
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
to achieve your current achievements.

553
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
I'm not being polite.

554
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Don't you think

555
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
my men are familiar with their actions?

556
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
They are also white swans?

557
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
My friends

558
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
were all white swans eliminated by Wei Zhong.

559
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Wei Zhong controlled the white swans by drugs.

560
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
You gave him the antidote

561
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
to the poison.

562
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
You taught me

563
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
to use every way I could.

564
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
I can't give up on struggling

565
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
because of the mud.

566
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Without you,

567
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Jinsha House wouldn't exist.

568
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
But don't worry.

569
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,680
I never mentioned your identity in front of them.

570
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Okay.

571
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Tell him what you told me last night.

572
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Don't keep it.

573
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
Yes.

574
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Hall Leader Ning,

575
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Emperor An has three sons.

576
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Besides the third prince,

577
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
the eldest prince and the second prince

578
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
have their own children.

579
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,680
But Emperor An

580
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
doesn't want to be the heir.

581
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Both princes

582
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
are against the return of their king.

583
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
But the eldest prince is greedy.

584
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Maybe he can break through.

585
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
The one who agreed to the return of his king

586
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
is Marquis Changxin.

587
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
He just came to power

588
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
after I left.

589
00:32:51,680 --> 00:33:14,260
Besides, he's one of the six

590
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
of the royal family.

591
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Marquis Changxin's mother

592
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
was born in the royal family.

593
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
After you left,

594
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
he followed Emperor An to attack Chu

595
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
and made many achievements.

596
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
He's a man of great power

597
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
and rarely interacts with other royal families.

598
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
But he's close to Emperor An's concubine.

599
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
He's a man of great power

600
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
and has a good fortune.

601
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
So both princes hate him.

602
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
His mother was also born in the royal family.

603
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Isn't she like Ju'er?

604
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Speaking of which,

605
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
I haven't heard from Ju'er for a long time.

606
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I don't know how she's been these years.

607
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
I think she's doing well.

608
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
Chief Jin,

609
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
I have something else to ask.

610
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Your Majesty,

611
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Your Majesty,

613
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
can't we stay here tonight?

614
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
I'm sure it's more comfortable than outside.

615
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
I'm afraid it's not convenient today.

616
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
We have to go back to the meeting.

617
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Ruyi was not here last night.

618
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
I'm very worried.

619
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Thank you for the information.

620
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,680
We'll go back and sort it out.

621
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Although you said the people of the Zhu Yi Wei

622
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
won't get close to this generation,

623
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
so many people from the Wu Guo delegation

624
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
are staying in Jin Sha House.

625
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
You have to open the door for business in the future.

626
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Yes.

627
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Ruyi, let's go back first.

628
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Let's go back first.

629
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
See you.

630
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Chief Jin,

631
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
I want to ask who is Ju'er.

632
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Chief Ning, you should ask your own master.

633
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Okay, goodbye.

634
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Goodbye.

635
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
You can't sleep?

636
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
A little.

637
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I'll accompany you.

638
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
No need.

639
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Chief Ning looks like a man.

640
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
You should go to accompany the chief of Jin Sha Gang.

641
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Why are you bothering me?

642
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Jin Mi Niang is your subordinate.

643
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
You're worried about her?

644
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
What about Pei Jiuniang?

645
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Why is she writing to you now?

646
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Did you really make an appointment with her?

647
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
Are you unhappy?

648
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
I'm not unhappy.

649
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Don't avoid it.

650
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
Answer my question directly.

651
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
You're unhappy.

652
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
Tell me why you're unhappy.

653
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
You promised to give birth to a child with me.

654
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
So I don't want you to have any relationship with other women.

655
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
But you said

656
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
you only wanted to give birth to a child with me.

657
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
You said you wouldn't hurt other women.

658
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Are you jealous?

659
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
I'm not.

660
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Okay.

661
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
You're not.

662
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
I'm not.

663
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
I just...

664
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
What?

665
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
I just hope you can keep your promise.

666
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
You can kiss me with other women.

667
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
But you can't before giving birth to a child.

668
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
Why can't I kiss you with other women?

669
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
How can I kiss other women?

670
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
You were drinking with those young men in Jin Sha Gang.

671
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
You were drinking with them.

672
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Isn't that kissing?

673
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
I just...

674
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
What?

675
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
You told me you wanted to give birth to a child with me.

676
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Because I'm good at martial arts.

677
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
Because I'm good at fighting.

678
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
But do you know that in some things...

679
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
In some things, I'm actually quite narrow-minded.

680
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Okay.

681
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
I won't do that in the future.

682
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
But you have to tell me about the thing with Pei Jiong Niang.

683
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Okay.

684
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
I did have a marriage agreement with Pei Jiong Niang.

685
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,680
But Yi Fu made the decision.

686
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
But after I was forced to marry Xue Zhi,

687
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
this marriage agreement was cancelled.

688
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
He also married someone else.

689
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm not sure if I can get married with him.

690
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
But he did.

691
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
I think he's married now.

692
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
And...

693
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
He didn't write me any letter.

694
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
That was all Yu Shi San's bad idea.

695
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
He said that only by doing that, you'll get jealous.

696
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
You'll feel sad.

697
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
You'll know why I get angry when I see you drinking with someone else.

698
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
What else?

699
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Do you have any other questions?

700
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
No more.

701
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,680
I'm sorry.

702
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Actually, I'm quite happy

703
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
when I see you angry.

704
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
It means you value me.

705
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,680
You

706
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
not only look for the young man, but also the young lady.

707
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Today, His Highness and Jin Mei Niang almost fought because of you.

708
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
Don't move.

709
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
You used to make me suffer.

710
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Today, it's your turn.

711
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Master Ning,

712
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
no matter what,

713
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
you're the one who's in the wrong.

714
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
Master Ning,

715
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
I'm sorry.

716
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
I'm sorry.

718
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
I'm sorry.

719
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,680
I'm sorry.

720
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I'm sorry.

722
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm sorry.

724
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I'm sorry.

725
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Unfortunately,

729
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
my friend breaks up with him.

730
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Isn't he getting better soon?

731
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
...

732
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
...

733
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
Yes...

734
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,440
Bring it on,

735
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,240
be careful,

736
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
don't man your face like a purple kiss.

737
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
What about it?

738
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
How's it going?

739
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Have you put everything away?

740
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
Yes, we have.

741
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
Go.

742
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,040
Everyone, move faster.

743
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Okay.

744
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
Guys, move faster.

745
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Chief Jin, please.

746
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Chief Jin.

747
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
Chief Ning.

748
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
You're so generous.

749
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
Aren't you afraid that Zhou Yiwei will misunderstand you?

750
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
No, I'm not.

751
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
I've discussed with the Chief.

752
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,040
The fact that the Song's Group is so generous

753
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
shows that our Jin Sha Gang is very good at it.

754
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,040
They can directly fight against the Imperial Court.

755
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
After you enter the State of An,

756
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
the people of An will know that you are not alone.

757
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
They will also be worried.

758
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
When we get to the State of An,

759
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
we will have to rely on you.

760
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
Chief Jin, you are always right.

761
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
You have to rely on Chief Jin.

762
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,040
I will obey everything you say.

763
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
But Chief Ning,

764
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
I'm going to say something ugly.

765
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
No matter what your relationship with Chief Jin is,

766
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
please don't get him involved

767
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
in the storm of saving your country's Chief.

768
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,040
Chief Jin was once a member of Zhou Yiwei.

769
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
Please don't make it difficult for him.

770
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
You can rest assured.

771
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
I'll just let him teach you.

772
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
As for the delegation,

773
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
he doesn't participate at all.

774
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Actually,

775
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
I hope you can persuade him

776
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:19,760
to put down the matter of the

777
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,760
State of An.

778
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
As for the things you ordered,

779
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
I will definitely help you.

780
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Later, I will send a letter to the Golden Sand House of the State of An

781
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
to ask them to help me.

782
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
To ensure that the six lost Tangs

783
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,760
can be quickly connected to you.

784
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,760
Thank you.

785
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,760
But I am willing to do so.

786
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,760
And I don't need you to use anything to exchange.

787
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
I hope you can do it.

788
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Otherwise, you are the enemy of our Golden Sand Gang.

789
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,760
If I am as good as Ru Yi,

790
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,760
will the best assassin let me go?

791
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
What's going on?

792
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
She's crying and laughing.

793
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
I'm not afraid of her being too kind.

794
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
It's the first time I've met a woman

795
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
who doesn't take you seriously.

796
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
To be honest,

797
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I feel quite sad.

798
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Get lost.

799
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Okay.

800
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,760
I think the Golden Gang Leader is really nice.

801
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
She's pretty and cool.

802
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
Didn't you like this type the most before?

803
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
Why didn't you marry her last time?

804
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
I like many types.

805
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Besides, liking and marrying are two different things.

806
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I am born to be a wandering man.

807
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
If I really marry her,

808
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
I will definitely run away for three days.

809
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
That would hurt her heart.

810
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
So don't be too long-lived.

811
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Just once.

812
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Otherwise, before Haihai cries,

813
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
I will cry first.

814
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Don't be too full of yourself.

815
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
Look at Ning Tong.

816
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
She was also a woman before.

817
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Although she was engaged to that Pei Nuguan,

818
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,760
she was also with the old Hall Leader.

819
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
If she meets Ru Yi,

820
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,760
she will also be in trouble.

821
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
You will meet your star sooner or later.

822
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Impossible.

823
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,760
If I meet her, I will die.

824
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
I'll wait and see.

825
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,760
By the way,

826
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I heard Ru Yi said she lost her sight.

827
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
She will lure a man from the headquarters

828
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
to the Qingfeng Temple in Liu's house in He County.

829
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Then she will attack.

830
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
How far is this place?

831
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
He County is also under the city.

832
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
It will take about five or six hours.

833
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
After passing He County,

834
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
it will be the state of the two countries.

835
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
On the way,

836
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
where can you find some rare herbs?

837
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
For example, mantou lo, wutou.

838
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
After passing He County,

839
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
there will be a store of herbs in the country.

840
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
But these herbs are commonly used in the army.

841
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
They may not be sold to you.

842
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
But there are several big medicine shops

843
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
in the Mi Mountain Town of Chu County,

844
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
which are adjacent to He County.

845
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
But that's not the place of our Jin Sha Gang.

846
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
It's okay. We'll solve this ourselves.

847
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
Your Highness, Your Excellency,

848
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I bid farewell here.

849
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
In the future, if there is an order,

850
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
no matter which Jin Sha Tower or Jin Bao Zhan,

851
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,760
as long as you leave a message,

852
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,760
I will come to you.

853
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
Thank you.

854
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
Then I bid farewell.

855
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
Time is like a arrow,

856
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,760
time is like a whip.

857
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
Meiniang.

858
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Brother Shisan, you cried this time.

859
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
Did you cry?

860
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
What are you laughing at? Get in the car.

861
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
The

862
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
The

863
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
The

864
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
The

865
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
The

866
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
The

867
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
The

868
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
The

869
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
The

870
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,760
The

871
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
The

872
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
The

873
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,760
The

874
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,760
The

875
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,760
The

876
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
The

877
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,760
The

878
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
The

879
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
The

880
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
The

881
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
The

882
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
The

883
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
The

884
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,760
The

885
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,760
The

886
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
The

887
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,760
The

888
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
The

889
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
The

890
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
The

891
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
The

892
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
The

893
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,760
The

894
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
The

895
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
The

896
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
The
