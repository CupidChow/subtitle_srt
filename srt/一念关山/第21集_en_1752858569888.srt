1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,120
the

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
the

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
the

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,120
the

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,120
the

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,120
the

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,120
the

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,120
the

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
the

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,280
the

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,280
the

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,280
the

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,180
the

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,180
to

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,180
the

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

21
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
The Heavens are the witness of our love

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,180
The Heavens are the witnesses of our love

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,260
your

32
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,760
Angu audio

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,020
either 100,000

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,480
or something like

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
It's really useful.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,600
It's the tribute of the Sha Xi Bu.

37
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,960
Since Li Tong Guang is in a marriage with a monk,

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,520
he will give the best to the Duke of Chu.

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,160
So,

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,520
your disciple is not that bad.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
Cry if you want.

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,480
I'll keep an eye on you.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
No one will be happy.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,560
No need.

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,080
Then drink this.

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
I don't want to drink.

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,160
I know.

48
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,600
The Guiyuan red dates soup that Sun Lang just made.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,760
It's blood-resistant.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
It's good for your skin.

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,880
It's good for your skin.

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
I don't want to cry in front of him.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm afraid he will worry.

54
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,920
I know.

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,600
Me too.

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,760
But last night,

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,040
you were the only one who didn't blush.

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm just like this.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,480
In life,

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I've drunk the best wine.

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm not afraid of anything.

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
I've drunk the best wine.

63
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
I've seen the most beautiful women.

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,040
I've fought the most happy battles.

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,000
I've taught the most righteous brothers.

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
It's worth it in this life.

67
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,440
If Lao Ning really doesn't make it this time,

68
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,640
I'll also give her that pot of wine.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,960
Anyway, in a few years,

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,640
we'll meet again at Sun Luo Palace.

71
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,280
You're quite thoughtful.

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
I hope you and Lao Ning are thoughtful too.

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,680
You two have been together for so long.

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,840
I was watching you, but you didn't persuade me.

75
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Because I know

76
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,200
that everyone has their own persistence and feelings.

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,360
Just like you persuaded me.

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
If you force me to get married,

79
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,960
I'm not willing to die.

80
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,880
But...

81
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,080
You don't have to persuade me.

82
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,440
Do you think I'll say anything?

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
For the sake of Ning Tong's poor condition,

84
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,680
you shouldn't leave her.

85
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
What are you thinking?

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,160
I'm thinking of you.

87
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm worried about you.

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
I saw what you looked like last night.

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,200
You risked your life to save her.

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
Without her by your side,

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,440
the one who can't be really accepted is you.

92
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Listen to me.

93
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,280
I know you two are both strong.

94
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,240
But it doesn't mean that the strong

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,360
don't deserve to be afraid or cared for.

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,040
Every woman is a flower.

97
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,680
Every man is a tree.

98
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,800
In the vast sea of people,

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,120
it's not easy to find someone who can support you.

100
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,800
You have someone worth your life.

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,720
What other problems can't be solved?

102
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,280
I said you don't have to persuade me.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
Because I've thought it through.

104
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Thank you.

105
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Where are you going?

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,920
Send someone to keep an eye on the people of Anguo.

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,600
The black people are too strange.

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,480
They are so evil.

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
You should investigate too.

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Don't worry.

111
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
I've already brought someone there.

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
That's good.

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
Send more people to keep an eye on the courier.

114
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,960
In case the black people come again tonight.

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,160
We should also investigate the river.

116
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,800
I don't believe that the black people

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,680
are born innocent.

118
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
And...

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Go to Jinxia House.

120
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,840
Ask Jin Mi Niang.

121
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,480
Brother 13 has already sent a message to Jinxia House.

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Don't worry.

123
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
That's good.

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,960
If it's something serious,

125
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
I believe Jin Mi Niang won't make it difficult for her.

126
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm a little tired.

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Help me lie down.

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Okay.

129
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Take a rest.

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Have a good rest.

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Let's go.

132
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Let's go.

133
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Come in.

134
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
You've been here for a long time, right?

135
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
You...

136
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
Lie down with me for a while.

137
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I have something to say.

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Actually, I...

139
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Let me say it first this time.

140
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay?

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Okay.

142
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
Actually, I wanted to say this a long time ago.

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
But I didn't want to say it.

144
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I didn't want to say it.

145
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I didn't want to say it.

146
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I didn't want to say it.

147
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
I didn't want to say it.

148
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I wanted to say this a long time ago.

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
But I didn't have the strength yesterday.

150
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
This time, I walked in the dark for a while at the ghost gate.

151
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I found myself a completely stupid.

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I have such a good you by my side,

153
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
but I don't know how to cherish you.

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
We've already experienced life and death.

155
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
I thought Li Dongguo

156
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
had been making trouble with you

157
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
for so long because of some things.

158
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Yes.

159
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I only found that you have small eyes.

160
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Who knew that you were wrong?

161
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
And Xin'er is also small.

162
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
I won't do it anymore.

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I won't do it anymore.

164
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
This time,

165
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
I saw you didn't care about anything

166
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
to save me.

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I swear in my heart,

168
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
as long as I can wake up,

169
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I will never let go of your hand again.

170
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
This is not your problem.

171
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It's also my fault that I didn't make it clear to you in advance.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
No.

173
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
It's all my fault.

174
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
It's all my fault.

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Ruyi,

176
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
from now on,

177
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
no matter what you do,

178
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I will be with you

179
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
no matter what you do.

180
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
You can build a world,

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
or you can find a lively place to live.

182
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Anyway,

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I won't force my wish on you.

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
I will also

185
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
listen to your thoughts

186
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
and respect your choices.

187
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I will respect every decision you make.

188
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
But you...

189
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
You have long been tired of Chen's world

190
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
and want to return to the forest.

191
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I am tired of many things.

192
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I am also tired of

193
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
the dead face of Qian

194
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,200
and the broken mouth of Shisan.

195
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
And Yuan Lu is so naughty.

196
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
But they are still my brothers.

197
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I am sorry.

198
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
After we finish this party,

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
we will go for a walk

200
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
in the Central Plains for a while.

201
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Then we will go to your house to burn the ashes.

202
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You can also

203
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
go to the mountain house

204
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
to find Jin Mi Niang to drink.

205
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
If you miss your brothers,

206
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I will take you to the palace

207
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
to see how Qian is doing.

208
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
We can also

209
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
save Yu Shisan who was punished for the theft.

210
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Then we can go to see our Yuan Lu.

211
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
What new things he has invented.

212
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
And we can also

213
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
bring two cats to Sun Lang.

214
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
By the way,

215
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Ying should have been married by then.

216
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
We can help him

217
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
teach his father a lesson.

218
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Okay.

219
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
If you are tired,

220
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I will also find you a small island

221
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
to stay for a while.

222
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I will practice swordsmanship.

223
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
You and Qiao will go through the mountain.

224
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
After you finish, you can kill the chicken and catch fish.

225
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
You can also take care of yourself.

226
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
How about it?

227
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Okay.

228
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
But from now on,

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
we will never be apart.

230
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Okay?

231
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
I am a little cold.

232
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
You gave me your blood.

233
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Of course you are cold.

234
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Yours is mine.

235
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Mine

236
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
is also mine.

237
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
You are my tears' witness

238
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
You are my longing's old friend

239
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
You are the unending curse

240
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Unable to separate the memory of the past

241
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Confirmation

242
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
The End

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
My hand is cold.

244
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
This is the Chinese medicine.

245
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Use the best medicine for him.

246
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Yes.

247
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
How is the investigation?

248
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
We just found a few bodies.

249
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
There are no traces of weapons or medical equipment.

250
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
These people must have prepared to come.

251
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
But judging by the formation, it is indeed the master who is suspicious.

252
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Where is the body?

253
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Over there.

254
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
My lord.

255
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Where are the men and women who attacked us first?

256
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
The women and men are all here.

257
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Zhu Yiwei is right.

258
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Master told me that Zhu Yiwei's women said that

259
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
they would be punished if they did not complete the task.

260
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
They usually stay here.

261
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
So their bones are more crooked than ordinary people.

262
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Is it because you drove them out of the river last time?

263
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
They are angry with revenge?

264
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I don't care what it is.

265
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Take someone to smash Zhu Yiwei's two most recent branches.

266
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
And tell Deng Huai,

267
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
if you don't explain it in three days,

268
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I will report it directly to the emperor.

269
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You suspect that Deng's commander did it.

270
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
But he has always regarded the emperor as his honor.

271
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
You and he have no personal grudges.

272
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
He has no grudges.

273
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
His men are all Chen Geng and his men are all the same.

274
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
But he is not necessarily Chen Gui.

275
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
He has not been in touch with He Dongwang for a year.

276
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
And in my heart,

277
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Zhu Yiwei is only in touch with my master.

278
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
So...

279
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Impossible.

280
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
What happened?

281
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
It's from the Wuguo delegation.

282
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
They sent people to check the body this morning.

283
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I haven't had time to report it.

284
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
It's the North plate.

285
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
How is it possible?

286
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
This is the secret passage dug by the North plate people.

287
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I heard from the lord when I was a child.

288
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
The North plate and the Central Plains have been in conflict.

289
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
But they are not in the bitter Northland.

290
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
That's right.

291
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Although the North plate is in the Northland,

292
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
it has always been in conflict.

293
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Sixty-one years ago,

294
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
the late emperor was not afraid of death.

295
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Finally, he conquered the North plate tribe.

296
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
But the late emperor also lost his military power.

297
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
He was in a state of disarray.

298
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
After that,

299
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
he had the situation of the nine-pointed group.

300
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Fifty years ago,

301
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
the three emperors of the three states,

302
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
An, Wu, Chu,

303
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
set up a alliance

304
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
to build the Tianmen Pass, which can withstand hundreds of miles.

305
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
They also gave out three thousand soldiers

306
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
to guard the Tianmen Pass.

307
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
They defended the safety of the people.

308
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
After that, the Chu state was defeated.

309
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
The late emperor also lost to the late emperor.

310
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
The Tianmen Pass was then taken over by the An state.

311
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Perhaps it was the mountain two months ago

312
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
that led the North plate tribe to have a possible opportunity again.

313
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Look.

314
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
The fifth tooth on both sides of their left and right sides

315
00:17:41,200 --> 00:18:00,400
is all covered with the

316
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
unrivaled soft wood wall.

317
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Wu Qian, I'm here.

318
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Send troops.

319
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Go to the Tianmen Pass and investigate immediately.

320
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Yes.

321
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
No need.

322
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Our Lord Ning has found out about this.

323
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
He asked me to bring a message to the lord.

324
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
If you want to know what happened,

325
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
go to the left of the land of the left temple

326
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
and see the cave.

327
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
What are you doing?

328
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
The North plate people are here.

329
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I don't have time to waste your time.

330
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
In the past two months,

331
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
six wars have taken place in the Hexian Palace.

332
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
The war has ended.

333
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
The two villages have been hit by more than 30 families.

334
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
But the officials of the An state

335
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
have been killed by bandits,

336
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
robbers and robbers.

337
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Zhang Qinghou,

338
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
do you know about this?

339
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
You mean these things are related to the North plate people.

340
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
But the Hexian general Wu Qian

341
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
didn't find the North plate people's traces before.

342
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
There.

343
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
It's the secret passage we found

344
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
after we followed the black man back to the forest.

345
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Don't think about it with him.

346
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
There are ten miles of long-distance trees

347
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
outside the Tianmen Pass.

348
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Ten miles of long-distance trees?

349
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Have the North plate people been dead for a long time?

350
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
That's right.

351
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
It's impossible to complete such a secret passage

352
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
in less than a few years.

353
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
In recent years, the two countries have been at war.

354
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Your An state has been in power.

355
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
And you transferred a lot of soldiers from Tianmen Pass.

356
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
This is why the North plate people have the opportunity

357
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
to build this secret passage.

358
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
This is the first time the villagers of Hexian have been in trouble.

359
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
It was two months ago.

360
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
That means the North plate people should have been in trouble

361
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
when they passed the secret passage.

362
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
While the two countries were at war,

363
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
the North plate people only dared to scout

364
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
and then attacked.

365
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
The villagers of Shaguang were in a hurry to return.

366
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
That's right.

367
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
They rarely move nearly a hundred people.

368
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
But the village where they went by chance

369
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
had little money and food.

370
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
So when they left, they must have been very happy.

371
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
But what's more,

372
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
when they were returning to Shandong after the forest,

373
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
they found the two women who were fighting

374
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
with Zhu Yiwei after the fire.

375
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
They were so happy that they even

376
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
took out their weapons.

377
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
How could they let go of such a good man

378
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
so easily?

379
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
That's why the six Taoist churches

380
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
dared to build the secret passage.

381
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
The North plate people wanted to retreat,

382
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
but they couldn't reveal the secret passage.

383
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
So they had to fight with us.

384
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
That's right.

385
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
The North plate people were very happy.

386
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
That's right.

387
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Chang Qinghou,

388
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
this is about the safety of the people of both countries.

389
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I have already informed the governor of Wudu.

390
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Please report to the state of Guizhou

391
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
and tell him to strengthen the secret passage

392
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
and the secret passage.

393
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Okay.

394
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
I will do my best to stop the North plate people.

395
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
But I'm afraid that the tribe

396
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
will be caught by Zhu Yiwei

397
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
before the emperor.

398
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
What I'm more worried about is

399
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
that the emperor only wants to

400
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
stop the secret passage.

401
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
He won't increase the security.

402
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
He has been saying that

403
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
the North plate people won't come these years.

404
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
So

405
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I want to ask your delegation

406
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
to leave with me as soon as possible

407
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
and return to the secret passage day and night.

408
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Although this North plate

409
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
and Zhu Yiwei's attack may be a coincidence,

410
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Zhu Yiwei is very determined

411
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
in case we have to return to the secret passage as soon as possible.

412
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
In addition,

413
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I want to ask you to emphasize

414
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
that you have already investigated

415
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
the North plate people's intention

416
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
to return to the south wall

417
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
and break through the secret passage.

418
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Okay.

419
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
We are the bad guys

420
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
who helped him so much.

421
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Okay.

422
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I promise you on behalf of the emperor

423
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
that we can set off in two hours.

424
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Tao, you are just in good health.

425
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Can you stand the journey day and night?

426
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I am also injured.

427
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
It's because the North plate people

428
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:46,900
are still so

429
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,900
I have the princess to take care of me.

430
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
Naturally

431
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
this wound is nothing.

432
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
He is angry.

433
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900
This kid

434
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
is not a nobody.

435
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Especially the one who is in charge

436
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
of the North plate people

437
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
is no longer a person who is in charge of the North plate people.

438
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
And Qin Zhao also said

439
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
that among the five officials of the North,

440
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
he is the one who is most sad about the North plate.

441
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Of course.

442
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
If he dares to make a mistake in such a big thing,

443
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,900
I have to kill him.

444
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
As long as he sees that I am close to you,

445
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
he will start to act strange again.

446
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
This is a disease.

447
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
You have to cure it.

448
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
You really have the attitude of an elder.

449
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,900
You are his master,

450
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
I am naturally his master.

451
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Of course, I am his elder.

452
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Your strange tone

453
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
is also equivalent to his.

454
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
I said I was his master.

455
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
You admit it.

456
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Of course you can be his elder.

457
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
This is not a waste of

458
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
his grace to save your life

459
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
with the Geng Shi Dan.

460
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,900
What Geng Shi Dan?

461
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,900
No, he saved my life.

462
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
This is not

463
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
How did you save me?

464
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
I am not yet recovered.

465
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,900
Come back and help me.

466
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
I heard that

467
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
the six hall of Ningyuan

468
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
is very powerful.

469
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Every few times,

470
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
they cut off the back of the North plate.

471
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,900
They also spread the fact that they destroyed the secret passage

472
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
to the officials of the river line.

473
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
It is all the work of the lord.

474
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
It's just some beautiful means.

475
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
I thought this would make the lord

476
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
listen to him and recognize him.

477
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
It's a joke.

478
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Some people

479
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
are not good at

480
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
some people

481
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
are good at

482
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
but they become

483
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
a monkey in a moment.

484
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Who am I talking about?

485
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Who am I talking about?

486
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
I don't know.

487
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
I don't know either.

488
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
Lord Hao.

489
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
What's the hurry?

490
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
When we arrive in Andu,

491
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
I will have them

492
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
blow out the candles

493
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
when they beg me.

494
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900
Lord Ning.

495
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Thank you.

496
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
I have something to report.

497
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
What's wrong?

498
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

499
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
six, five, four, three, two, one.

500
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Let's go.

501
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
It's a one-time job.

502
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Let's go.

503
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
It's a one-time job.

504
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Don't be too over-confident.

505
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
The young man is too shy.

506
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
If he gets angry,

507
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
it will affect our mission.

508
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Whatever.

509
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
You can hate him if you want.

510
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
I don't want to be a bad guy.

511
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
I don't want to be a bad guy.

512
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
I don't want to be a bad guy.

513
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
I don't want to be a bad guy.

514
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I don't want to be a bad guy.

515
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
You can hate him if you want.

516
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
It's not a big deal.

517
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
My Lord.

518
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Liuli is badly injured.

519
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
The doctor said it's not good to move so easily.

520
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
I decided to let her stay in the river.

521
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,900
I see.

522
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Tell our men to speed up.

523
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Don't let the people of Wu State get too excited.

524
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Yes.

525
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Let's go.

526
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
Let's go.

527
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Go.

528
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Here's the food.

529
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Boss.

530
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
There's chicken soup in the restaurant.

531
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
You brought a bunch of antidotes.

532
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,900
Here.

533
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Make up for it.

534
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
Okay.

535
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
Did Zhang Song's men get the antidotes?

536
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Brother 13 and I took them ourselves.

537
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
They heard that Ning Tong

538
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
killed all the brave soldiers.

539
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
They gave them the antidotes without a word of talk.

540
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
They complained that

541
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,900
they had no choice but to obey Zhang Song's order.

542
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,900
They will definitely obey you in the future.

543
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
Here, my beauty.

544
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Eat the chicken legs.

545
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Thank you.

546
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Here.

547
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Brother 13, here you go.

548
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
You don't know how to eat chicken wings?

549
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,900
Wait.

550
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
You can't drink this soup.

551
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
I tried it.

552
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,900
It's not poisonous.

553
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,900
It can harm people.

554
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
There's shrimp juice in this soup.

555
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Shrimp is a chemical that slows down the healing of wounds.

556
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
This ball is made of rabbit meat.

557
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,900
It's easy to get cold and hot.

558
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
It's very effective in healing.

559
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Li Tong Guang.

560
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
It must be him.

561
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Is he crazy?

562
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Why would he do that?

563
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
I think it's possible that

564
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,900
he got too excited at the old Ning and the beauty's place today.

565
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
He's going to kill himself.

566
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
He's going to kill himself?

567
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
That bastard.

568
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
I'll go settle accounts with him.

569
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Don't go.

570
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
I'll go.

571
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
This is between us men.

572
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
It's okay if you drink this soup.

573
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
Hurry up and drink.

574
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Who's there?

575
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,900
Who's there?

576
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Did I scare you?

577
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
You haven't practiced for days.

578
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
You're hurt.

579
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
What do you want?

580
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,900
The chicken soup and meat balls you gave me earlier

581
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
tasted really good.

582
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Is this how you thank your savior?

583
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
I believe you know that

584
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,900
my martial arts are far above you.

585
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
I want to kill you.

586
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
It's just like a fight.

587
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:16,600
So your

588
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
nonsense.

589
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
I came here today

590
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
to make a deal with you.

591
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Li Tong Guang.

592
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
You've been working so hard for so many years.

593
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
You're making progress.

594
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
You just want to end the war with the Andes.

595
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
But you don't want to take revenge.

596
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
You're just a mere talent.

597
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
As long as you work with me,

598
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
you don't have to please that Noble Consort Chu.

599
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
You betrayed yourself.

600
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,900
How do you know about Noble Consort Chu?

601
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm the owner of the Six Halls.

602
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
I know about the Six Halls.

603
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Even if Wu Guo loses the war in Tianmen Pass,

604
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,900
he will still be able to save the country.

605
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
You're threatening me.

606
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
I just said

607
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
I'd come to make a deal with you.

608
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Do you think

609
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
if you can go back to Andu Mian Sheng

610
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
and bring us to the right track,

611
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
the Andes will wake up

612
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
and reward you

613
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
after they visit the North Gate.

614
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Don't dream about your spring and autumn.

615
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
You're talking in a dangerous tone.

616
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Of course not.

617
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
I'm not talking in a dangerous tone.

618
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
I'm talking in a dangerous tone.

619
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
You're talking in a dangerous tone.

620
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
I'm talking in a dangerous tone.

621
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
I'm talking in a dangerous tone.

622
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
I'm talking in a dangerous tone.

623
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,900
I'm afraid you're in trouble.

624
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
You know it yourself.

625
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,900
I won't believe you.

626
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Believe it or not.

627
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
You're too young and too lonely.

628
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
But you only have six thoughts in your mind.

629
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Do you think you can't find one

630
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,900
in the long civil room?

631
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
You can't find one

632
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
who can see that you're not satisfied

633
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
with Ande's reputation.

634
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
It's just that Ande always suppresses you.

635
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
They don't think you can remember anything.

636
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
But now the situation has changed.

637
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
You're already a feudal lord.

638
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
The North Gate has made another deal.

639
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
Think about it.

640
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,900
What will the two princes and those who hate you do?

641
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,900
They will deny this deal.

642
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
They will say that I colluded with your Wu State

643
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
and made a deal.

644
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
They won't be that stupid.

645
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,900
After all, the North Gate

646
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
has a lot of officials in the river.

647
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
I think they will

648
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
give you a bright future.

649
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
I received news from the Six Halls.

650
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,900
After Ande received our 100,000 taels of gold,

651
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
you wanted to get rid of me, right?

652
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
Didn't you just make a great achievement?

653
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
Didn't you just get promoted?

654
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
Then they will recommend you

655
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
to be the vanguard of this punishment.

656
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
And not to mention that you didn't want to start a war.

657
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
When you found that your soldiers

658
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
were all old and weak

659
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
in the civil war,

660
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,900
the grains were all made of rye.

661
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
You're not a good person.

662
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
You're not a good person.

663
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
The grains were all made of rye.

664
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,900
How many times do you think you will win Chu Huo?

665
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,900
If you lose the war,

666
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
they will accuse you of being ungrateful.

667
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
Ande will spare you.

668
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
Don't scare me.

669
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,900
These things will happen in the first place.

670
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,900
It won't happen at all.

671
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
You've been an official for so many years.

672
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Do you have any friends?

673
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Except for Zhu Yin,

674
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
do you believe that your subordinate

675
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
would offend the prince

676
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
and will obey you?

677
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
I have an engagement with the Chu Mansion.

678
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
The Chu Mansion will not leave.

679
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
But I heard that

680
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
the Lord of Jinming

681
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,900
is not very satisfied with your husband.

682
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
And the marriage of the daughter of the An State

683
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
is also common.

684
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Ande is a good person.

686
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Those two princes

687
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
are not good people.

688
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Every time it's not the back of the battle,

689
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
it's the people's troubles.

690
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Li Dongguo,

691
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
I knew you were against Ande

692
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
to start a war again.

693
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
So

694
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,900
I decided to help you.

695
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Please calm down, Your Highness.

696
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Ning told us to bring you here

697
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
to hear this.

698
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
He wants you to know better

699
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
about the situation in the An State.

700
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
You can't do this kind of thing.

701
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
But you have to know.

702
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
If you don't set a rule in advance,

703
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
I won't consider working with you.

704
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
There are rules.

705
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
First,

706
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
you have to be sick.

707
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
You said that you would run back to the An State

708
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
to fight the An family

709
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
after the assassination.

710
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Then the civil and military officials

711
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
won't let you

712
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
go out of the city

713
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,900
in a short time.

714
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,900
And Ande will also let Zhu Yiwei

715
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,900
give you an explanation.

716
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Second,

717
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,900
you offended two princes at the same time.

718
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,900
But from today on,

719
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
you have to rely on the second prince.

720
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,900
As long as the two princes start a internal conflict,

721
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
you will have a chance to get away.

722
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,900
Third,

723
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
you have to put down your status

724
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
and make friends

725
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
with the Duke of Chu's family.

726
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,900
In this way,

727
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
you will have friends in the court.

728
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
And you have to please the Lord of Jinming.

729
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
After all, the Duke of Chu loves you like his life.

730
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Even for your future grandson,

731
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
he will support you.

732
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
Ande is already fifty years old

733
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
and has not been crowned.

734
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
But as long as we six princes start a conflict,

735
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
the two princes will be in great danger

736
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
for the sake of the enemy.

737
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
At that time,

738
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,900
it's the best time

739
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
for you to be the last one.

740
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
To be honest,

741
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
I'm all for supporting

742
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,900
the third prince who is in the castle.

743
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
It's much better

744
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
to cooperate with me

745
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
than with the concubine

746
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,900
of the harem.

747
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
You said so much

748
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
just to help you win back your fifth brother

749
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,900
after I take over.

750
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
You're right.

751
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
This is for you.

752
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
But

753
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
I have to add one more thing.

754
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,900
From now on,

755
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,900
you are not allowed to fight against us in the Mingli case.

756
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
And you have to stay away from the princess.

757
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
You are not allowed to use any external means

758
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,900
to fight against me.

759
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
You are making this condition

760
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,900
to make it difficult for me.

761
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
I'm making it difficult for you.

762
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
Seeing how jealous you are,

763
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
you have to bow down

764
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
and feel wronged and embarrassed.

765
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Is there anything in this world

766
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,900
that makes people happier than this?

767
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
Changqing Lake.

768
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,900
The land, the beauty.

769
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Choose one.

770
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,900
I can't answer you now.

771
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,900
Alright.

772
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,900
I didn't talk to you for nothing tonight.

773
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,900
I'm going back now.

774
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Think about it.

775
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Wait.

776
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,900
What's wrong?

777
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,900
I have no personal feelings with the concubine of the harem.

778
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
I'm just a partner.

779
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
I swear to God.

780
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
You don't have to explain these things to me.

781
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Do you know?

782
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Does she know what it has to do with you?

783
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,900
Then don't tell her.

784
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,900
Although I know this has nothing to do with her,

785
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,900
I don't want her to misunderstand.

786
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Even if I know that

787
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
she just looks like a master,

788
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,900
I don't want to see her

789
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
look at me with the eyes of a brush.

790
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,900
You're back.

791
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
I'm back.

792
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,900
What are you looking at?

793
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
You look pretty.

794
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
My Ruyi

795
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
is really beautiful

796
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
and graceful.

797
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,900
No wonder that boy

798
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
is so fond of you.

799
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,900
Are you jealous again?

800
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,900
Or is it not going well?

801
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,900
I'm not jealous.

802
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
I'm just a little jealous.

803
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
In my eyes,

804
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
she is just a little kid.

805
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Although she has a little bit of a rebellious personality,

806
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,900
she will be obedient if she is taught a few more lessons.

807
00:40:49,900 --> 00:41:01,160
You really are a

808
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
I hate her,

809
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
but all these years,

810
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
I miss you.

811
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Your love is real.

812
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
The love of a teenager is the craziest,

813
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
the most ancient and famous.

814
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
I'm a little jealous

815
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,900
of her.

816
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
I know.

817
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
So the more I'm heartless to her now,

818
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
the better I am to her.

819
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
We have to rush in tomorrow.

820
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Go to sleep.

821
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
I mean,

822
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
I sleep in my room,

823
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,900
you sleep in your room.

824
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Didn't you wait for me here just now?

825
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
I

826
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
I'm back now.

827
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
You can go back to sleep.

828
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Go to bed early.

829
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,900
So you also have a rain cloud.

830
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,900
When you are cold and sweaty.

831
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
When I'm cold and sweaty,

832
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:36,720
I'm convinced that I'm a

833
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
But I will be there for you.

834
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
I don't care if you have martial arts,

835
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
as long as I want to protect you,

836
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
I can protect you.

837
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Then I will entrust myself to you.

838
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Please contact me in advance.

839
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
No problem.

840
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
The night is dark and the wind is high.

841
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
No one else.

842
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
Why not?

843
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
My wound is not fully healed yet.

844
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
When I'm better...

845
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I'm kidding.

846
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,720
The king of Anguo has always been ambitious.

847
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,720
According to the relationship between the six halls and the Golden Sand Tower,

848
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
after the Great War of Angu,

849
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
it is more difficult to conquer Chu.

850
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
If after arriving in Angu,

851
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,720
the palace is settled,

852
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
and they don't let you bring your servants,

853
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
how do you respond?

854
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,720
The first thing is to see the emperor,

855
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
to confirm the peace of the Yu family.

856
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
The first thing is to see the emperor,

857
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
to confirm the peace of the Yu family.

858
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,720
The first thing is to see the emperor,

859
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,720
to confirm the peace of the Yu family.

860
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,720
Who drinks a cup of fengshui,

861
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,720
and the blood is turned into ashes?

862
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Who sighs for a moment and then leaves?

863
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,720
The sky is scattered like flowing water.

864
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,720
Looking back, the future is like this.

865
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,720
The world is like a glass of wine.

866
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Who will stay for the rest of his life?

867
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Who is a little worried?

868
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,720
The new people are fearless.

869
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
Who is afraid that a dream will become a dream?

870
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Only for the wind to come back.

871
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,720
The world is like a glass of wine.

872
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,720
How many years have passed?

873
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:03,720
The whole life is like a glass of wine.

874
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:16,720
The whole life is like a glass of wine.
