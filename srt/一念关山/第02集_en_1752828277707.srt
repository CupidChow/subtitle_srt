1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
A GORGEOUS PETORITY

2
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,100
What's wrong with you now?

3
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,620
She did medicine.

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,080
It's okay.

5
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,340
Yi Yi,

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,020
it's still hurts.

7
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,080
She is now sick.

8
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,280
She is suffering a clean wound.

9
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,040
What am I supposed to do?

10
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,500
Continue the red celebration.

11
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,100
The rest of the medicine

12
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,240
is all yours.

13
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,540
Simple, right?

14
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,560
ần

15
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
водо

16
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,220
VIDE

17
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,220
70

18
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,220
Woah...

19
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:47,260
The

20
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,260
There are 47 colleagues who are fighting on the spot.

21
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
They don't even blink.

22
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Did you interrogate that white bird called Linglong?

23
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
Yes.

24
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,260
I broke her bones with my own hands.

25
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
That's how she admitted it.

26
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,260
The White Bird

27
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
Sir, please have a look.

28
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,260
Someone killed our headman.

29
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,260
Get me the fish that was caught.

30
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
Yes.

31
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,260
Move!

32
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
This way.

33
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,260
Six Halls, arrest the seven criminals.

34
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,260
Don't move.

35
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,260
Sir, please have a look.

36
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
A woman?

37
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
Yes.

38
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
Six Halls, arrest the seven criminals.

39
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,260
Keep searching.

40
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Find her!

41
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Yes.

42
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
Sir.

43
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Get out. Don't bother me.

44
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Let's go.

45
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,260
The Zhu Yiwei's people escaped.

46
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
We can't let the master know about this.

47
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,260
Otherwise, we will all die.

48
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Are we going to investigate this?

49
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
No.

50
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Tell Mr. Yue to investigate.

51
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Even if the escaped person

52
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
brings the matter to the headquarters of Zhu Yiwei,

53
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
it won't affect us.

54
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Yes.

55
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Let's go.

56
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Who is it?

57
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
Watch out!

58
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Watch out!

59
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Mr. Zhao, you've been sneaking around

60
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
all night.

61
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,260
Are you going to steal the chicken or touch the dog?

62
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
You should have come earlier.

63
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,260
I almost gave you two bombs.

64
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Why are you here?

65
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Sir.

66
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
I'm not going to tell you.

67
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
You're not old enough

68
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
to remember things, are you?

69
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
I'm not a person who sneaks around.

70
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Stop!

71
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
What's wrong?

72
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Do you want to taste the bomb

73
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
that I blew up half of the machine?

74
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Go ahead.

75
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
I don't believe

76
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
you dare to blow up Ning Yuanzhou's old house.

77
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Don't go in!

78
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Do you have any conscience?

79
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Ning Teng just died.

80
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Aren't you afraid of disturbing his spirit?

81
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
Go in with me!

82
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Go!

83
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Zhao Jian!

84
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
You can't go in!

85
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
Go.

86
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Zhao Jian!

87
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
You're not Zhao Jian!

88
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
You even tried to kill him

89
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
by going to the army.

90
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
You didn't even spare his bones!

91
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
The six Dao Sects have a master like you

92
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
who has been in danger for 18 lifetimes!

93
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,260
You really care about your Ning Teng.

94
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,260
It's a pity that your family is so poor.

95
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,260
You're not even a person who can take care of your family.

96
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,260
You're just a person who can't even take care of your family.

97
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
Your Ning Teng

98
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,260
doesn't take you as his bride.

99
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Old Master!

100
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,260
Zhao Jian!

101
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,260
Ning Yuanzhou!

102
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
If you don't come out now,

103
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,260
I'll burn down your old house.

104
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,260
One.

105
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Two.

106
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Three.

107
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,260
Zhao Jian, you're crazy.

108
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,260
General Xiao just sent back his head.

109
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
How could he still be alive?

110
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
Ning Yuanzhou.

111
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
You're willing to leave your old house,

112
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,260
but do you have the heart to leave your little companion?

113
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Once the Pipa Valley is broken,

114
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,260
his hands will be broken from now on.

115
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
One.

116
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Two.

117
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
Three.

118
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
Ning Teng.

119
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
You're still alive.

120
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Ning Teng!

121
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Ning Teng!

122
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Ning Teng!

123
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
Ning Teng!

124
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
Ning Teng!

125
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,260
You've come to my grave at this hour.

126
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Zhao Ji, you're getting better at this.

127
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,260
I knew you wouldn't die so easily.

128
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
I heard from the tea house

129
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
that a man who was eight feet tall

130
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,260
bought 13 pieces of fried chicken and a bite of crispy.

131
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
I knew it was you.

132
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Teng.

133
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
This is the problem with my brother.

134
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
I'll change it next time. I'll change it.

135
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Don't be mad.

136
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Take it down.

137
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
This...

138
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
It's Ning Teng.

139
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
What's going on?

140
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
If you disobey, you'll die!

141
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Under the name of the Heavenly Dao,

142
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,260
do you still want to know about the news of the 16th?

143
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,260
They're all your friends who are allergic to friendship.

144
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,260
If you want to know, follow me.

145
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
I'll be right back.

146
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
Zhao Ji.

147
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Take care.

148
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
You too.

149
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
Sir Zhao.

150
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Can you tell me where they are?

151
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,260
Drink some wine first and then you can tell me.

152
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
Okay.

153
00:15:40,260 --> 00:16:10,100
Fifth.

154
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,540
I tension is so bad.

155
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,400
Finally, I haveORAWAROWA

156
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,360
I feel so healthy.

157
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,100
떼

158
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,740
You can rely on this thing,

159
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,440
not my wu-idi station which is Colossus什—

160
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,820
夠 swell

161
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,700
You recognize me

162
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,800
You know how to trust me

163
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
You just hurt me.

164
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
My uncle, Prime Minister Zhang

165
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
can also take away your family's ancestral tomb.

166
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Yes.

167
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
But I just want to know where are Chai Ming and his subordinates.

168
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Did they get sent to the guards by you?

169
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
When you have done what Prime Minister Zhang told you to do,

170
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I will tell you.

171
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Oh.

172
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
What do you want me to do?

173
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
The north beast is in the city.

174
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Prime Minister Zhang needs someone to save him.

175
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
In the Six Halls,

176
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
only you can punish the country.

177
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Yes.

178
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Prime Minister Zhang has a pretext.

179
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
As long as you can succeed,

180
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
you will be pardoned.

181
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
And you will be reinstated.

182
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
What do you think?

183
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Mr. Zhao,

184
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
tell me where Chai Ming and his subordinates are.

185
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I will tell you if I want to do it or not.

186
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Ning Yuan Zhou,

187
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,800
don't give me this.

188
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I am just saying,

189
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
you came here at midnight.

190
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I think Zhang Song has given his order.

191
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Chai Ming and his subordinates went out with the king.

192
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Half of them died in battle.

193
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Half of them were captured with the king.

194
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
As long as you go to the country,

195
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
you can save them together.

196
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
If that's the case,

197
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I am not interested.

198
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I am not their leader anymore.

199
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
I am suffering because of the fire.

200
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Please go back and tell Prime Minister Zhang

201
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,800
that I will not marry Anguo.

202
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Ning Yuan Zhou!

203
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Don't drink and eat.

204
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Don't drink and eat.

205
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Why are you angry, Mr. Zhao?

206
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Do you remember

207
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,800
the ninth, tenth and thirteenth

208
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,800
of the six-stripe soup?

209
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
The ninth,

210
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
sixth and tenth.

211
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
The ninth,

212
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
sixth,

213
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
and tenth.

214
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
The ninth,

215
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
tenth,

216
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
and tenth.

217
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,800
The tenth,

218
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
and the twelfth.

219
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
The thirteenth.

220
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,800
The one who can't defeat the superior.

221
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Die.

222
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
The one who can't defeat the superior.

223
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Die.

224
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
This place is dedicated

225
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
to my ancestors,

226
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
and my godfather, Song Luo.

227
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
He wanted me to be the leader,

228
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
but I was sent to the army.

229
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I am sorry.

230
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,800
The leader of the old party is wise and brave.

231
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,800
The leader of the old party is wise and brave.

232
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
The spiritual power that Zhao Ji just played

233
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
belongs to his family.

234
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
The sword spirit is like a human.

235
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Zhao Ji is not worthy of the old party.

236
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
He is the 13th of the Tang's rule.

237
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
He should die.

238
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
I have been running for 20 years

239
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
for the six-stripe soup.

240
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
But Zhao Ji is so evil

241
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
that he framed me many times.

242
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
He wants me to die in Tianwen Pass.

243
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
He is the 10th of the Tang's rule.

244
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
He should die.

245
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Die.

246
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Zhao Ji has been running for only half a year.

247
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
He destroyed everything

248
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,800
that the old party and I have built.

249
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,800
He is the one who can't defeat the superior.

250
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
He is the one who can't defeat the superior.

251
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,800
He is the one who can't defeat the superior.

252
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
The 16 brothers of the Heaven's law,

253
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
half of them are killed by the walls.

254
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Half of them are killed by bloodshed.

255
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,800
He is the 9th of the Tang's rule.

256
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
He should die.

257
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Die.

258
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Now the Tang's rule of the six-stripe soup

259
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,800
has been executed.

260
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Do you have any objection?

261
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Yes, sir.

262
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Brothers,

263
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I am not your master anymore.

264
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
I am just a ghost

265
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
who is tired of the court.

266
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,800
If you still remember the fire of the past,

267
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,800
just pretend that you haven't seen me tonight.

268
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,800
After I bury my father tomorrow,

269
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
I can leave the capital and return to the capital.

270
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Don't go, Ning Tong.

271
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You will always be our leader.

272
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
We can't bear to part with you.

273
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Since you left,

274
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
the Six-stripe soup has been different.

275
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Please come back and continue to be our Tang's leader.

276
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Brothers,

277
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
the world is in a state of endless bloodshed.

278
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Not to mention that my body is in a state of emergency.

279
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I can't continue to fight.

280
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I just want to find a place

281
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
where the mountains are clear and the water is clear.

282
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I want to live for two more years.

283
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Please,

284
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
do me a favor.

285
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
The Chuyi Guards

286
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
and the Wudu branch have been destroyed.

287
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Mr. Zhao went out to hunt for the remaining evil.

288
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I don't know when he will return.

289
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
At least three or four days.

290
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
It's getting late.

291
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
The Chuyi Guards haven't been caught either.

292
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Brothers, retreat!

293
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Ning Tong, please be careful!

294
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Take care.

295
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
What's wrong?

296
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
You didn't tell me you were playing fake death.

297
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Do you know that I thought you were really gone?

298
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I won't do it again.

300
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
You know that

301
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
after Zhang Song started to serve Zhao Ji,

302
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I didn't want to play anymore.

303
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
If I don't play fake death,

304
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm afraid you'll be fooled too.

305
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
How can he let me go back to the mountains?

306
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I don't care.

307
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm your follower anyway.

308
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I'll follow you wherever you go.

309
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Even if you die,

310
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
I'll be the one to watch over you.

311
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Okay, I promise you.

312
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
It's a deal.

313
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Close the door.

314
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I'll bury the old master tomorrow morning.

315
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
By the way,

316
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
the last time the princess saw me,

317
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
she asked me when I would go back.

318
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Should I tell her?

319
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Talk to you later.

320
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Close the door first.

321
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Okay.

322
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I'll go.

323
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Old man, the door is locked.

324
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
This...

325
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
You're the one Luo Qing wanted to catch, right?

326
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
The spy of the Imperial Guards.

327
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
No, I'm not.

328
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Please spare me.

329
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
You're not one of them?

330
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Then why

331
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
are you the only one

332
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
of the Eighteen Fathers?

333
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
I...

334
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I really don't know.

335
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
I live in the Blue House.

336
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
I'm just a dancer in the brothel.

337
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,800
My sisters went to the Shiyi Palace to show their art.

338
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
But none of them came back.

339
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
The officers of the Liudatang

340
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
said that the music they sang

341
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
was the Emperor's.

342
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
They were afraid that they would kill them.

343
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Last night,

344
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
they came to the brothel to arrest people.

345
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
They said that Linglong was a spy.

346
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm suspicious too.

347
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I don't want to die.

348
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I don't want to die.

349
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
I was framed by the prison guards.

350
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I was framed by the prison guards.

351
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I'm here to escape.

352
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I know about this.

353
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Zhao Ji wanted to ask them for money.

354
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
That's why he framed them as spies.

355
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Zhao Ji is already dead.

356
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Don't cry.

357
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Don't worry. It's okay.

358
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm here for you.

359
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Help her up.

360
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Miss.

361
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Please spare me.

362
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Don't be afraid, miss.

363
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I just want to try you.

364
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
I don't want to kill you.

365
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I don't know how to use my skills.

366
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
How could it be the guard?

367
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Try it.

368
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
She doesn't even have the internal force.

369
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
The hall is empty.

370
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
She was scared by you.

371
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Don't be afraid.

372
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
You're the only one here.

373
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Don't be afraid.

374
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
I'll find you.

375
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Don't worry.

376
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,800
I've got something.

377
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
You can go back to the prison.

378
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
I'm going to save my wife.

379
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Don't worry.

380
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
I'm going to save my wife.

381
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I'm going to save my wife.

382
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm going to save my wife.

383
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I just want to know how is the emperor doing?

384
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
The emperor is still safe.

385
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

386
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
With your own eyes?

387
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I am incompetent.

388
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,800
I was with the emperor after the long Qing dynasty of North An.

389
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Chang Ming!

390
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Chang Ming!

391
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Call your brothers from the six hall to escort me out!

392
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Okay.

393
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Take me out!

394
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Your majesty, be careful!

395
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Brother!

396
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Chang Qing's lord, Li Tongguang, greets your majesty.

397
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Rise.

398
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Get out!

399
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
What are you?

400
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
I am starving!

401
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Get out!

402
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Get out!

403
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Get out!

404
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Get out!

405
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Get out!

406
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
You can't eat!

407
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Your majesty!

408
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Jiang Qiong!

409
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
How is it?

410
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,800
I told you that your brother is safe.

411
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Since you saw it,

412
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,800
you can bring me a message to your country.

413
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
The empress can do it too.

414
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Just say that my country doesn't have any emperor.

415
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,800
As long as you have 100,000 taels of gold,

416
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
you can release me immediately.

417
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Really?

418
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Of course.

419
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Since I was able to capture you,

420
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,800
I can release you too.

421
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Please be kind to your majesty.

422
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Your majesty is the king of the country.

423
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
If you are deliberately humiliated,

424
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
there will be tens of thousands of people in our country.

425
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
I will take your life.

426
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Since you are so brave,

427
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I will give you another condition.

428
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
The envoy of your country

429
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
must be the prince.

430
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
100,000 taels of gold?

431
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,800
A prince from another country

432
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,800
is coming for me?

433
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,800
I know that the bandits are not good.

434
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Although Tianmen Guanyi's army is defeated,

435
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
the bandits are still strong.

436
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
But once we give 100,000 taels of gold,

437
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
our country will be in great loss.

438
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Other than that,

439
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
they can take the money and keep detaining your majesty and me.

440
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
In this way, no one in the palace

441
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
can only use the empress's son to take the throne.

442
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
By then, the country will be in a state of war.

443
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
The day of defeat will not come.

444
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Tomorrow morning, you can tell the ministers about this.

445
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,800
The rest is up to you.

446
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Yes.

447
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Your highness.

448
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I have one more request.

449
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Say it.

450
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I went back to the capital.

451
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
I heard a lot of rumors.

452
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Everyone said that the emperor was in danger.

453
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
It was our Tian Dao that protected the rebels.

454
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
But I can guarantee with my life.

455
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Our Tian Dao people,

456
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
no matter if they are alive or dead,

457
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
they will not be able to live in peace.

458
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,800
I beg your highness to prove it for us in the court.

459
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
How can I prove it for you?

460
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,800
The Tianmen Pass is thousands of miles away from here.

461
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
The only people alive except you

462
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
are the rest of the people who were captured by the emperor.

463
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
With my words,

464
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
how can I make you feel relieved?

465
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Could it be...

466
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Could it be that our brothers died for nothing?

467
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,800
The conscript's brother.

468
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
That's why,

469
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,800
I can share the responsibility of my brother using maximum integrity.

470
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Please do not harm our brother.

471
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,800
I promise you won't do anything evil.

472
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
가지 YOURSNAND

473
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:14,160
You know what, if I'm Wouldn't you listen?

474
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,680
I am a good girl too.

475
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:28,380
Are you done, just one quick

476
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,920
7-tab, break.

477
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,260
Wait a minute, Young Master, pause

478
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,020
Ru Yi wasn't asking you to leave

479
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,400
I was only asking if you could leave

480
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,120
There are also evil people outside

481
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,780
But me, a weak woman

482
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,060
Who might be out of this house

483
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,820
And cannot be kept alive at all

484
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,100
How does this matter to me?

485
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,760
God has the Calabash Gr 기다�

486
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,400
Is a good person

487
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,120
I'd be comfortable Alors, I must report

488
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,680
that it's time for美容

489
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
You are a good person.

490
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,880
I believe you already knew last night

491
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,480
that I used to be a member of the Six Taoist Church.

492
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
Will I be a good person?

493
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,680
You didn't dare to leave like last night.

494
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,080
You are a good person.

495
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
I beg you to show some kindness.

496
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Don't drive me away.

497
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,480
What do you want me to do?

498
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,480
I am willing to do it.

499
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
I am willing to do it.

500
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,080
A person who has no inner strength

501
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,680
can escape from the hands of the Six Taoist Church.

502
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,280
I believe the martial arts of the church

503
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,680
taught you a lot of things.

504
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Are you Bai Que?

505
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
No.

506
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,280
He didn't teach me anything except dancing.

507
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,280
I am definitely not the Bai Que of the Zhu Yi Wei.

508
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,680
Mister, do you believe me?

509
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,680
I really want to believe you.

510
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,280
But you know that Bai Que is a Zhu Yi Wei.

511
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,680
How can I believe you?

512
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
The door is over there.

513
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Go by yourself.

514
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
I won't go.

515
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
You won't go, right?

516
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
Will you go?

517
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
I won't go.

518
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Even if you kill me,

519
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
I won't go.

520
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
The people of the mountain are saying

521
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
that Ling Long is the Bai Que of the Zhu Yi Wei.

522
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
I am already a sinner.

523
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Ling Long wanted to stop me before.

524
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
But I just didn't understand.

525
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
If I had to go,

526
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,680
I wouldn't want to be a Bai Que who betrays the world

527
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
and also has a man.

528
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,680
So you became me from a slave.

529
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Why bother?

530
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
A person who never received training

531
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
can live in my hands for so long.

532
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
But with this,

533
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
even if I go out,

534
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
I can live well.

535
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Who said I never received training?

536
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
The people in the cellar

537
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,680
are full of blood and blood.

538
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
You six sects

539
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
tortured me with love.

540
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Which one is not as painful as now?

541
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
But even if it is painful,

542
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
I can endure it.

543
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
Because I want to live,

544
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
I don't want to die.

545
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Ling Long

546
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Tao Er, what are you doing?

547
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
This Ning Tou is too cruel.

548
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
It's all my fault.

549
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
I shouldn't have talked back to him.

550
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
I really don't want to be caught by those people.

551
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
You try these first.

552
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Can you help?

553
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
I'll go and make medicine now.

554
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Thank you, Brother Xiao.

555
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
My name is Yuan Lu.

556
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Don't worry about Ning Tou.

557
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Leave it to me. I'll talk to him.

558
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
You really want to keep him?

559
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
He looks a little pitiful,

560
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
but he is a stranger after all.

561
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
If you think he has any problems,

562
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
I'll drive him away now.

563
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Anyway, from now on,

564
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
I will always listen to Ning Tou's words alone.

565
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Okay, kid.

566
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
You've grown up.

567
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,680
I'm not a kid anymore.

568
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
You've grown up.

569
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
But I want to ask you.

570
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
We've been used to seeing life and death in the Six Halls.

571
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
Why are you so kind to him?

572
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
I was born a slave.

573
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
You know that.

574
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
Before my sister died,

575
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
she was also a dancer in the church.

576
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
So...

577
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Why don't you let her stay?

578
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
If you really think he has any problems,

579
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,680
I'll drive him away now.

580
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
Okay, I'll listen to you this time.

581
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Thank you, Tao.

582
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Go, go make medicine.

583
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
I'll take care of it.

584
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Stop pretending.

585
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
You didn't even cry.

586
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
You, Bai Xue,

587
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
you don't have to argue with me anymore.

588
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
But,

589
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
you can stay.

590
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Thank you, sir.

591
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
If I come to life, I will definitely pick up the grass and return it to you.

592
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Don't come to life.

593
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
Just now.

594
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
I think you're quite energetic.

595
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
After you take the medicine,

596
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
you can start working.

597
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
There are a lot of firewood in the firewood house waiting for you to cut.

598
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Make some more food.

599
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
We're going out.

600
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
We'll eat something hot when we get back.

601
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Do you understand?

602
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Okay, sir.

603
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Tao.

604
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,680
Thank you, Yuan Xiao Ge.

605
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Drink it.

606
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,680
I think that the State of An might not be in a bad mood.

607
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,680
The battle at Tian Meng Pass has caused a lot of damage to the State of An.

608
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,680
The way the State of An used to change the hostage is also very good.

609
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
If they take the money and don't let go,

610
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
it's not enough just to get the Emperor's Beishou.

611
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
And also, the King of Danyang.

612
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
The State of An's leader was ambitious and ambitious at the beginning.

613
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
He was very arrogant.

614
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
But you said that it was good.

615
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
It's very good.

616
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
Xiao Zhu.

617
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,680
When did I say that the King of Danyang went to the State of An?

618
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,680
Isn't the King of Danyang the Prince?

619
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
Stop arguing.

620
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,680
If you don't want to be the ambassador to the Emperor,

621
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
you can't escape the responsibility of not being able to take the people's place.

622
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
If I'm the ambassador,

623
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I have no right to fear the people and destroy the country.

624
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Li Wei, Chen Gong.

625
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,680
If you have two glasses of poisoned wine in front of you,

626
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,680
one is Pi Shuang,

627
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,680
and the other is He Dinghong,

628
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,680
what would you choose?

629
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
But the question is,

630
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,680
why do we have to choose one cup?

631
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
That's right.

632
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
The people of An must be in a lot of pain right now.

633
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,680
How should we settle the Emperor?

634
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
If our country doesn't pay the ransom,

635
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
they will risk the Emperor's life?

636
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,680
We can drag them for a while,

637
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
so that they won't be in danger anymore.

638
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
Nonsense!

639
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,680
The Emperor is in trouble.

640
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,680
But you don't seem to be a little anxious.

641
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Do you still deserve to be a minister?

642
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Your Highness,

643
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
you are a noble person.

644
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,680
How can you be a humble eunuch

645
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
and just listen to the court's meeting?

646
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
I...

647
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
I'm also worried about my brother.

648
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Besides,

649
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,680
besides Brother Yuanzhou and you,

650
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,680
who else would be able to take care of the people?

651
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
I...

652
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
I'm also worried about my brother.

653
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,680
Besides,

654
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
besides Brother Yuanzhou and you,

655
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
who else would take me as a princess?

656
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,680
Compared to that eunuch,

657
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
I'm not that noble.

658
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,680
Your Highness, you can't be so naive.

659
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Even if your mother is not a good person,

660
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,680
you are still the late emperor's bloodline.

661
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,680
But,

662
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,680
when Sister Zhang scolded me for being a blind woman,

663
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,680
she never treated me as the father's daughter.

664
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,680
Since Your Highness is ten times more beautiful than Princess Zhang,

665
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,680
then you should allow her to be ten times more fierce than you.

666
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Do you really think so?

667
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,680
In my heart,

668
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,680
Princess Zhang is the most beautiful person at that time.

669
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,680
Then...

670
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,680
Then why don't you want to marry me?

671
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,680
My father's family is always only from the nobility.

672
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,680
I'm just a guard who has no foundation.

673
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
Unless I make a contribution,

674
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,680
I will never be able to marry you.

675
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,680
This time,

676
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,680
I wanted to ask for a favor,

677
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,680
but I was not allowed to.

678
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
You shouldn't have gone.

679
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,680
When Brother Yuanzhou went,

680
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,680
I was so crying that my eyes were blind.

681
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,680
So many people died in Tianmen Pass.

682
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,680
If there were also him inside, what should I do?

683
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
I...

684
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Your Highness, don't worry.

685
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
You forgot that

686
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
Lord Ning is not only your daughter-in-law,

687
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,680
but also the only son of Lady Gu.

688
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,680
He is also the most outstanding vice-principal in the six halls for 30 years.

689
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,680
With his skills,

690
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,680
how could he be in trouble?

691
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,680
Really? You promise?

692
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,680
I promise.

693
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,680
I promise.

694
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,680
No.

695
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,680
You're lying.

696
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,680
You just said that the prince consort is only from the nobility.

697
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,680
But the prince consort of Sister Zhang

698
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,680
is just a commoner.

699
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Princess Xin Yang was born by the late empress.

700
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,680
She is worth 800 million.

701
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,680
The case can be blamed on her.

702
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
No need.

703
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,680
It would be great if I could have 800 million.

704
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,680
The empress is pregnant now.

705
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,680
She is worried about the emperor.

706
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,680
Isn't the prince consort close to her?

707
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,680
If she can walk around often,

708
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,680
maybe after the emperor returns to the court,

709
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,680
you will have a chance to be promoted.

710
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
I'm leaving.

711
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,680
Brother, I'm willing to be the ambassador of the camp.

712
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
Stand up and talk.

713
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,680
Brother, if you don't agree that I should be the ambassador of the camp,

714
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,680
I will never be able to return.

715
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,680
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

716
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,680
Since the state of An proposed conditions,

717
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,680
the emperor will definitely return.

718
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,680
Our state has no 100,000 taels of gold.

719
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,680
This is not a matter of gold.

720
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Then...

721
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Your Highness, Princess Ying,

722
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,680
Prince Yan suddenly went to the court meeting.

723
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,680
He said he would ask for the spring festival to welcome the emperor.

724
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,680
No.

725
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Before the emperor passed away,

726
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,680
he told me to take care of you.

727
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,680
Now you are in the hall alone.

728
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,680
How can you run away?

729
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,680
Brother, I beg you.

730
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,680
Please, please, please.

731
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,680
I'm going.

732
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,680
Please, Prince Yan, please.

733
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
Please, Prince Yan, please.

734
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,680
Sister-in-law.

735
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,680
Slow down.

736
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,680
Be careful of your health.

737
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,680
We can't let Prince Ying go.

738
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,680
Prince Ying's legs were broken to save me.

739
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,680
I promised to protect him.

740
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,680
But what can you do if you go to the court meeting?

741
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,680
Prince Yan is too ambitious to leave the country.

742
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,680
He will not go to the country.

743
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,680
Although all the princes have gone,

744
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,680
there are still some sons.

745
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,680
At worst, I will choose one of them

746
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,680
and pass to the late emperor.

747
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Who dares not to recognize him as a prince?

748
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,680
Can you tell me about the Kuan?

749
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,680
I'm afraid those clansmen

750
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,680
are not willing to sacrifice their lives to save him.

751
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,680
I can give him a size of 1.3 billion.

752
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Under the weight, someone will be moved.

753
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,680
1.3 billion?

754
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,680
1.3 billion?

755
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,680
Who drinks a cup of fengshui

756
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,680
and falls into the ashes?

757
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Who sighs for a moment and leaves?

758
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,680
The sky is dark and the road is flowing.

759
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,680
Looking back, the future is so beautiful.

760
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,680
The world is so beautiful.

761
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,680
Who will stay for the rest of his life?

762
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,680
Who will stay for the rest of his life?

763
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,680
The heart is fearless.

764
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,680
Who is afraid that dreams will come true

765
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,680
and only the wind will come back?

766
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,680
The world is so beautiful.

767
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,680
How many years have passed?

768
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,680
What is the purpose of the old heart?

769
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,680
The whole life is not for the people.

770
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,680
The whole life is not for the people.
