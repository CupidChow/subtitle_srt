The ones on the boat

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
I have been promoted.

10
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,000
But he is still кноп

13
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,800
About the dem annat

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's like he can't remember that Zhu Yi Wei has an assassin who never failed

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
who is deeply loved by the late queen

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and even bravely broke into the Demon's Moon Pavilion to control people's hearts

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did the person who did it really do it?

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Although I don't have any evidence

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but since I knew that the prince, Wang Guo Gong, had escaped from death

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I already had an answer in my heart

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Other than him, who else would remember the late queen who had been dead for five years?

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Other than him, who else would have such courage and such powerful means?

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Commander Deng, please wait

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Commander Deng, His Majesty has an edict

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
His Majesty's edict, Zhu Yi Wei failed to follow the master

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
cooperative of the two states is not enough

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
it is this to cremate so that as soon as possible the younger sisters from the system by such a vote

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,920
ABD So much?

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,400
努力

30
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
It's not fair.

31
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Why don't we leave her to God?

32
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,400
She will be alive and well.

33
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
She will be born as a black woman.

34
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
What's going on?

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
What's going on?

36
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Let me.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Let's go.

38
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Why?

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Why is it me?

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Why?

41
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Your Majesty.

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Your Majesty.

44
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm 21 years old.

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Your Majesty.

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Your Majesty.

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I don't want to die.

48
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Your Majesty.

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Take her to the black room.

51
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Take her away.

52
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Your Majesty.

53
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Take her away.

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I don't want to die.

55
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Your Majesty.

56
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Your Majesty.

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Your Majesty.

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Your Majesty.

59
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
I don't want to die.

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Your Majesty.

62
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Your Majesty.

63
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Your Majesty.

64
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Your Majesty.

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
What's wrong?

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
What's going on?

68
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
What's this?

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
What happened?

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,940
walking

71
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,760
eer is

72
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,160
care

73
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,900
to

74
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,680
die

75
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,520
who

76
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
It's almost time.

77
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,300
The Temple of God

78
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,160
Tho,

79
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,280
there is a way!

80
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,640
The hour has arrived!

81
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Wait a minute.

82
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
A good man told me to tell you that

83
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,640
when you kill someone, you should put your blood into the bone.

84
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
If you kill 70% of the people, you will be lucky.

85
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Wait for me!

86
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Sir.

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
I will take charge of the execution.

88
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
I will take the risk to kill the next person.

89
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Ready!

90
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Start!

91
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Let's go.

92
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Let's go.

93
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
I have been waiting for you.

94
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I'm here.

95
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I need to talk to you.

96
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
I need to talk to you.

97
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I need to talk to you.

98
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I know you are feeling bad.

99
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
But if you want to stay here,

100
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,280
I'll listen to you when someone talks to me.

101
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,080
For the first time, I feel that I'm not good enough.

102
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm not as beautiful as Meiniang.

103
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,880
Once he's free, he'll do whatever he wants.

104
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,680
He'll use his Golden Sands Tower to help his old friends.

105
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
What about me?

106
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,080
Although I hate that kind of stupidity that doesn't treat women as human beings,

107
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,560
I've done what I should do.

108
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,720
But I still haven't done anything for them.

109
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
Even today, I saw them being killed by Andy.

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
I still can't do anything.

111
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,040
But you said that you'll make him pay for it.

112
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,520
Yes, I will.

113
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,360
But I just haven't found the best time to do it.

114
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,560
That's why I can only wait.

115
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,680
I want to help Wei Zhong and make up for what I should have done.

116
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,520
But I've been thinking for a long time.

117
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,200
I didn't expect that...

118
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,600
Don't worry.

119
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
We'll think about it.

120
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,480
Or we can ask Jinminiang directly.

121
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
He's been dealing with Zhu Yibei a lot these years.

122
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,920
He knows what they need.

123
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll help you to finish it.

124
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
I'll just cry for a while.

125
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,320
Just cry if you want to.

126
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,280
I'll be with you forever.

127
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,760
Don't be sad.

128
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,040
George knows you'll be fine.

129
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
I know it.

130
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,760
Don'telyn, you'veloved and failed me.

131
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,600
You didn't scream for me.

132
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
How do you know?

133
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Under the soft bone,

134
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
if you keep using your blood, you can have a chance to live.

135
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
The human of our Liu Dao Hall

136
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
used to be responsible for saving the dead.

137
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
After so many years,

138
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
there will always be some unknown secrets.

139
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Thank you.

140
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Today I saved the seven cities.

141
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Come, sit for a while.

142
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Yes.

143
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I'll be right back.

144
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
It's better now, right?

145
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
That's good.

146
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Oh, right. What were you doing earlier?

147
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Just now, the eunuch came to pass the decree

148
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
that the king of Angola

149
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,040
has raised the amount to 130,000 taels of gold.

150
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,760
His son is dead.

151
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,280
He is still so greedy.

152
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
Who would have thought?

153
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,280
Lord Du and A Yan have written to return to the capital.

154
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,040
But now the treasury of the Wu Kingdom is empty.

155
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,280
Zhang Song can't take more than 30,000 taels.

156
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,320
So everyone decided not to give money.

157
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,560
They went to save him.

158
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
These days,

159
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,080
we should let Ying visit the officials

160
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,520
and pretend to

161
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,280
ask the king of Angola to take back the city name.

162
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,400
So they can relax and be alert.

163
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,520
The city is in chaos today.

164
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
Is the defense of the Yuan Tower loose?

165
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,040
It's tighter.

166
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,760
Think about it.

167
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,480
So many people died.

168
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,720
The guards outside the tower,

169
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
the guards,

170
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
they dare not to be careful.

171
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,480
Today, they also lit all the candles in the tower

172
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,360
and stayed under the tower all night.

173
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,640
Then the Wu Kingdom

174
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,840
can't sleep at all?

175
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,480
The Zhe'an Emperor will doubt us.

176
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,440
But he can't find the evidence.

177
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,000
So he has to think of a way to torture the prisoners.

178
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,600
But what I'm most worried about now

179
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
is that tomorrow is the day

180
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,320
when Ying visits him.

181
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm afraid he

182
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,000
will torture Ying.

183
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,080
Ying,

184
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,000
can you take me away from here?

185
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
I can't stay here for a day.

186
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
Now,

187
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,440
take me away from here right now, okay?

188
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
Ying.

189
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,600
Please wait.

190
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,440
I can't.

191
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
If you don't take me away from here, I can't.

192
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,600
These days,

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,960
I've been in the court of Angola.

194
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,400
But my brother

195
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,360
suddenly brought the capital to the 130,000 taels of gold.

196
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
Then go to the court.

197
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,880
I don't know the 130,000 taels of gold.

198
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,320
Ying,

199
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,160
I just want to leave here and go back to the Wu Kingdom.

200
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,360
A war

201
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,920
has exhausted all the power of the Wu Kingdom.

202
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,280
It's not easy to collect 30,000 taels of gold.

203
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Please bear with me for a while.

204
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,360
I've tried my best.

205
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,120
Look over there.

206
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes.

207
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,280
Go.

208
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,080
Lord Ying is arranging the rescue of Xia Teng.

209
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,560
When?

210
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,480
We have to wait for the right time.

211
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,880
Before,

212
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,320
I've already given you the mechanism box.

213
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,720
Just tell me the order and I'll come.

214
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,480
Wait.

215
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
Again?

216
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
When will you stop?

217
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,560
You...

218
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,040
Now,

219
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,960
you're relying on Lord Ning.

220
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,920
You two are the ones who trick me.

221
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,480
You're the most unforgivable one.

222
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
Do you know that?

223
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,200
Then please punish me now.

224
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,040
Then find other capable officers to save you.

225
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,200
How dare you be rude to me?

226
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,480
I just want to ask you to realize the reality.

227
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,120
The reason why you're in this situation

228
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,040
is not me or Lord Ning.

229
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,720
It's yourself.

230
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,040
I'll kill you now.

231
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,360
It's a pity that you can't kill me.

232
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,520
There's a big hole on the top.

233
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,680
Before you stab me to death,

234
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,680
you just need to use a little force.

235
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Okay.

236
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,240
Then go back and tell Ning Yuan Zhou

237
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
that if I can't get rid of this damn Yong An Tower in seven days,

238
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
I'll tell Andie that you're a woman.

239
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,960
I can also give you to Andie as her maid.

240
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,840
How about it?

241
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
Since you won't leave,

242
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,600
you'll stay and die with us.

243
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,320
You're crazy.

244
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
That's right.

245
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,760
I'm crazy.

246
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
As long as I can leave here alive and go back to Wudu,

247
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,440
I can do anything.

248
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,640
If you're crazy,

249
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,960
I'll have to wake you up.

250
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Ning Yuan Zhou?

251
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,320
How did you get here?

252
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,920
Do you think we can't do anything in the C-House every day?

253
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,720
If we don't want to save you,

254
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,280
why do we take the risk to investigate the underground?

255
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,080
The weather is good today.

256
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,800
Right, Zhu Yi Wei?

257
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,040
Behave yourself!

258
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,800
We're not welcome to be bullied.

259
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Don't touch me!

260
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm not going to push!

261
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,520
What are you doing?

262
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,920
Say it again!

263
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,680
What's going on?

264
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,560
Back off!

265
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
He pulled the knife.

266
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,040
He pulled the knife, but I didn't.

267
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Look at him.

268
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,120
I think Zhu Yi Wei is trying to make trouble.

269
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,040
Let me try.

270
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,080
When I played with the knife,

271
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,520
your hair hasn't grown up yet.

272
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
You're trying to make trouble.

273
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Right, Yuan Luo?

274
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,280
Don't push!

275
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
What are you doing?

276
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Don't touch me!

277
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,440
Don't touch me!

278
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Stop!

279
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Stop!

280
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,680
I'll guard it for you.

281
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,840
You talk to my brother.

282
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,640
Sit down.

283
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Sit down and talk.

284
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,520
Is what you said true?

285
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm not a loyal and benevolent person.

286
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
I even...

287
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't want to be a traitor

288
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,320
because of your Majesty's wish.

289
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,920
But because of that,

290
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,440
I don't want to lie.

291
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,760
Good.

292
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,920
Good.

293
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Now,

294
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,160
you just need to be safe.

295
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,480
I can guarantee your safety.

296
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,480
No problem.

297
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,920
Ning Qing,

298
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,680
as long as you can do what you said,

299
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,720
I can forgive you for being rude.

300
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:56,560
And you

301
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Otherwise, you will be accused of defying the order.

302
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Your Majesty is really thoughtful.

303
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
But it's a pity.

304
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,560
If this thoughtfulness can be placed on the battlefield,

305
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,760
then tens of thousands of soldiers in the Great Wu will become the ghosts of the wronged.

306
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,960
Is something wrong?

307
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:19,480
I ask you to pack the

308
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,300
immediately

309
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I'm so proud of myself.

310
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Do you deserve it?

311
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
I should leave now.

312
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
But before I leave,

313
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
I have a warning for you.

314
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
I came here

315
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
because of the order from Prime Minister Zhang

316
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
and His Highness.

317
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I'm here for the country,

318
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
for my brother.

319
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
But not for you.

320
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
The Emperor's Banquets

321
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Really?

322
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
His Majesty ordered that

323
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
His Majesty's death was not a big deal.

324
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,300
It took the Princess a long time

325
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
to get the news.

326
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
So I had to report it to you.

327
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
The Princess also said

328
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
His Majesty had no evidence,

329
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
but also angered the Prince.

330
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
His Highness went to Tianmen Pass this time.

331
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
He wanted to go back to the capital.

332
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
It's not easy.

333
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
So the Princess wanted to

334
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
return the third prince

335
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
who gave birth to the Princess to him.

336
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
I believe that soon,

337
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
I will prove to you

338
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
my strength.

339
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Go and bring A Yue here.

340
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
A Yue,

341
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
when you meet the Marquis Changqing tomorrow,

342
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
give him this gift.

343
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
You want to give him all the treasures,

344
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
cloth, horses and everything?

345
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
This is the most important one

346
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
in the family of my grandmother.

347
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
My brother asked you for it several times

348
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
but you refused to give it to him.

349
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Because only this

350
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,300
can prove our family's sincerity to him.

351
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
And from now on,

352
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
all the things in Sha Xi Bu,

353
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
including the cavalry,

354
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
are divided into two parts.

355
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Your brother's part,

356
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
and Marquis Changqing's part.

357
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Because Marquis Changqing

358
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
will climb higher than my father.

359
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
What do you mean by that?

360
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
He has proved his strength.

361
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Your aunt just sent a message from the palace.

362
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,300
The prince is on his way to the capital.

363
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
But His Majesty thinks

364
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
the second prince did it.

365
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Actually, Li Tongguang did it.

366
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
He wants to support the third prince

367
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
who is born from the palace.

368
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,300
He wants to be the official of the government.

369
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
No.

370
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
If he is not careful,

371
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,300
he will be in danger of being destroyed.

372
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
I...

373
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
I have to end this engagement with him now.

374
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
I don't want to ruin my reputation.

375
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
Ah Yue.

376
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
Father.

377
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
You can't be confused at this time.

378
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
I'm not confused.

379
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,300
I'm more awake than ever.

380
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
You see Sha Xi Bu

381
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,300
more important than your life.

382
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
I'm very happy.

383
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,300
But since the moment of marriage,

384
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Sha Xi Bu and Marquis Chang Qing were together.

385
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
His Majesty is ungrateful.

386
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
With the two princes of the Chia Feng family

387
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
in trouble,

388
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,300
there must be a bloody battle in the court.

389
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Once Li Tongguang made a move,

390
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,300
he cleaned up and cleaned up the two princes.

391
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
This kind of trick and trick

392
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
even the emperor of that year

393
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
was not afraid of it.

394
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,300
Your eldest brother is well-off.

395
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,300
It's not easy to keep the city in the future.

396
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
For the future of Sha Xi Bu,

397
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,300
I have to do it.

398
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
Ah Yue.

399
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Promise me.

400
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
After you take the opportunity to see him,

401
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,300
you must get along with him.

402
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Don't make trouble again.

403
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
You can't beat him.

404
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
Okay.

405
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
This is a treasure.

406
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Horse skin.

407
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
You can give it to him first.

408
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
But don't take it.

409
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
You have to keep it in my hand.

410
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
If my father takes this marriage contract

411
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
as a cooperation,

412
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
then I must have something

413
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
to support him.

414
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
You are more thoughtful than my father.

415
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,300
But when you meet him,

416
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
don't force yourself.

417
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,300
You must be gentle with your words.

418
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Only in this way,

419
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,300
your future life will be safe and smooth.

420
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Do you understand?

421
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Everything my father did

422
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
is to make you happy.

423
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Nonsense.

424
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,300
I said I don't know anything about gold and jade.

425
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,300
I only know this.

426
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Actually, he treats me well.

427
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,300
Really?

428
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,300
My lady,

429
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,300
the people who are going around the capital

430
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,300
are all coming to see you.

431
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
I'm afraid that there are too many people.

432
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
It's quiet here.

433
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Let's go.

434
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Yes.

435
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
You are really generous.

436
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
There are thousands of people in the department.

437
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,300
If I give you all of them,

438
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
it will be a big deal.

439
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
So put it here.

440
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
I'll take care of it.

441
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Anyway, I have a good reputation

442
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
in front of His Majesty

443
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
for training the maids.

444
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
You can tell me how you want to train them.

445
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,300
I have learned both tactics,

446
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,300
swordsmanship and acrobatics.

447
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
You are the county magistrate.

448
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
Why do you learn these?

449
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
What?

450
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Only you have the ambition to be a good girl?

451
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
I have never been convinced since I was a child.

452
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm not convinced.

453
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,300
The first duke of Sha Xi is a female general.

454
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
But my father and grandfather always think

455
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
that the head of the tribe

456
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
can only be inherited by my brother.

457
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
I learned these since I was a child

458
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
just to prove one day

459
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
that I'm not worse than my brother.

460
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,300
I have dealt with your brother before.

461
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
You are better than him.

462
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,300
I can hear you compliment me.

463
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,300
You are really a good man.

464
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Why?

465
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
You are in a good mood today.

466
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
I have fought against people who bullied me for more than ten years.

467
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
And I have set up my family in the Ministry of Revenue.

468
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I also got such a big favor from the Ministry of Nobility.

469
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
Of course, I have to be nice to our master.

470
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
He... He is blood.

471
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,300
A black horse?

472
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
Why is it called blood?

473
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Why not?

474
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Your white horse is also called Wuyun.

475
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
How do you know my horse is called Wuyun?

476
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
I...

477
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I don't know whose horse is better.

478
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Let's have a competition.

479
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Okay.

480
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Let's go.

481
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Let's have a fair competition today.

482
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Good horse.

483
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Go.

484
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Wuyun.

485
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I know you finally gave up.

486
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
But on the battlefield, even if someone gives in,

487
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,300
a good general will not be merciful.

488
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
It sounds like you have been to the battlefield.

489
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
I didn't before.

490
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
I may not in the future.

491
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,300
And I may not be worse than you.

492
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Then I wish you a successful horse ride.

493
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
I wish you the best.

494
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,300
How good it would be if we could get along like this forever.

495
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
I told you.

496
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
I will do my best to get along with the county magistrate.

497
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Please go back and tell the Duke of Chu.

498
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Tell him thank you for his trust.

499
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
I will be careful.

500
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
I won't let him down.

501
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Okay.

502
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
The Duke of Chu hasn't announced the death of the prince.

503
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Take the prey I gave you back.

504
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Tell him that you are hunting.

505
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
No one will suspect.

506
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
You are so thoughtful.

507
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Thank you.

508
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
See you.

509
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
Wait.

510
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
And this.

511
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Li Tongguang.

512
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
I like this place.

513
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Can I come here often?

514
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
If you like it,

515
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
you can come here anytime.

516
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,300
The face of the county magistrate is as red as the bag.

517
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Is it because of the Duke?

518
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
I don't have.

519
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Don't talk nonsense.

520
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,300
But my mother said

521
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
if you don't quarrel, you won't be a couple.

522
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,300
In fact, some fate

523
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
can be found out slowly.

524
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Look.

525
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
This is for your girlfriend's horse ride.

526
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,300
And it's for the wild.

527
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,300
How sweet.

528
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Nonsense.

529
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I don't like her.

530
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
I just don't want to be her enemy for the rest of my life.

531
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Then they said

532
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
if you want to be with me forever,

533
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,300
I can't be indifferent.

534
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Right?

535
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,300
Let's go.

536
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Go.

537
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Since Wu Di used his duck

538
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
to block the case of fake Xueyuan Zhao,

539
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
now there is only one way to attack him.

540
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
How sure do you think you are?

541
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,300
At most, I'm sure.

542
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,300
At most, I'm sure.

543
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
The barrier outside the tower

544
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
is much more strict than we thought.

545
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
There are many traps outside the tower.

546
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,300
It's hard to avoid the trap

547
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,300
if you go up from the tower.

548
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
And

549
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,300
every floor in the tower is full of traps.

550
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Last time, the reason why the crown prince could go up safely

551
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,300
was because they planned to close the trap.

552
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,300
But if outsiders go up,

553
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
it's hard to go up.

554
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,300
We may touch the silk and the sword at any time.

555
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,300
Not to mention the crown prince.

556
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Even I have to be very careful

557
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,300
to not force him to go up.

558
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
There are traps in every floor of the tower.

559
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,300
If we can make the guards who are responsible for the traps faint,

560
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,300
can we?

561
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
It might be possible before.

562
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
But now,

563
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
the guards of the tower

564
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
are several times more powerful than before.

565
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,300
It's just a bed.

566
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
If it doesn't work, just pretend.

567
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,300
It's a big loss for us.

568
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Sorry for being impulsive.

569
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,300
It's okay.

570
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
If you can't think of a way now,

571
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
just put it aside and think about it later.

572
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
I have contacted Jin Min Niang

573
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
to see if we can buy some guards who are responsible for the traps.

574
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Yue Lu, think about it.

575
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
See if we can find

576
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,300
something that can be simplified and not trigger the bell.

577
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Okay.

578
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Shi San,

579
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
you go to the nearby exploration site of the tower.

580
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Find the most perfect route.

581
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Okay.

582
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
You follow Shi San.

583
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,300
It's best to set up more traps around the temple.

584
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
I understand.

585
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Lao Qian,

586
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
prepare more herbs.

587
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
We are ready to go.

588
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Okay.

589
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Ru Yi, I need you to...

590
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
I'm more than you in the security.

591
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,300
I'll discuss with Li Teng Guang.

592
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
From Yong An Tower to the gate,

593
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
find a route that can help everyone

594
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,300
to leave safely and quickly.

595
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,300
Okay.

596
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
What okay?

597
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,300
You are so generous.

598
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,300
Send Mei Er to meet her rival.

599
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,300
Do you know a play called The Greatest Stone Ball?

600
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
I have heard of a play

601
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,300
called Jin Min Niang's Hit and Beat.

602
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
I watched it.

603
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
It's a good movie.

604
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
I'll have to be the main character in it.

605
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Are you sure?

606
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
I'm sure.

607
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm sure.

608
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,300
I'm sure.

609
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,300
I'm sure.

610
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm sure.

611
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
I'm sure.

612
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,300
I'm sure.

613
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
It's fine.

614
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
I'm sure.

615
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
I'm sure.

616
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,300
I'm sure.

617
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Okay.

618
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Let's go.

619
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Let's go.

620
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Let's go.

621
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Get up.

622
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,180
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,740
Just now, Shi San and others know that you're in a bad mood.

624
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,740
So they deliberately made a scene and made you happy.

625
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,900
Help me thank them.

626
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,340
But I see that you're not in a good condition today.

627
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
What's wrong?

628
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,780
Didn't you sleep well last night?

629
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,020
I've been dreaming of those five Chuy-Wei.

630
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,620
I've killed a lot of people before.

631
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,100
But I've never had a nightmare.

632
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,580
I really don't like myself to be so weak and broken.

633
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,940
Having a guilty conscience doesn't mean you're a coward.

634
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,580
Maybe you think that

635
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,660
it's a sin to be a victim of others.

636
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,900
Plus, you're a strong person.

637
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,820
You think that an assassin shouldn't have any emotions.

638
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,580
But Ru Yi,

639
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,980
you're a human.

640
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,180
You're not a devil.

641
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,340
You've helped Chuy-Wei

642
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,540
clean up a lot of corrupt officials and evils for years.

643
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,620
Even if it's because of the public interest,

644
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,780
even if the five people who were killed by Andy yesterday

645
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,820
have nothing to do with you,

646
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,300
they're all living people.

647
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,020
So as the days go by,

648
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,780
the burden on your heart will get heavier.

649
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,140
I feel like my blood pressure is going to run out.

650
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
I have a way

651
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
to solve this problem.

652
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:11,860
Let's go.

653
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,260
When I was a kid, my mom told me

654
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,300
that if I had any regrets or sadness in my heart,

655
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,700
I must write it down.

656
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,940
Writing it down will make me feel better.

657
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,860
I hate Andy

658
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,100
for the guilt of Chuy-Wei's assassin.

659
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,620
I didn't find the real face of the second prince earlier.

660
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,620
Except for these,

661
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,740
I have no other regrets.

662
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,980
Didn't you tell me

663
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,940
that you always hate your father?

664
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,500
Why don't you write it down?

665
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,100
So.

666
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,100
I heard boy his first name why

667
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,940
Except for this.

668
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,100
Not anymore

669
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Waiting, waiting for the two of us to be together for a long time

670
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Waiting, waiting for this journey of the mountain to be covered in clouds

671
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,100
The coffin falls into the dream

672
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,100
I always want to be the one who breaks through the wall

673
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,100
What about you? What did you write?

674
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,100
Waiting, waiting for this journey of the mountain to be covered in clouds

675
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Who knows that I can't protect my brother?

676
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
And...

677
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,100
I can't see him for the last time

678
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:55,100
If there's a love, I'll love him forever

679
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Yan Zhao

680
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
I suddenly understand

681
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,100
If I want to know what I can do for Zhu Yi Wei

682
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
I should go to him in person

683
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,100
Please help me to figure out what they want

684
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Okay

685
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,100
But no matter what you do, I'll always be with you

686
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,100
I'm sorry

687
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
I'm sorry

688
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
I'm sorry

689
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,100
I'm sorry

690
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,100
I'm sorry

691
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,100
I'm sorry

692
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,100
I'm sorry

693
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,100
I'm sorry

I'm sorry

695
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,100
I'm sorry

696
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,100
I'm sorry

697
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
I'm sorry

698
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
I'm sorry

699
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
I'm sorry

700
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,100
I'm sorry

701
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
I'm sorry

702
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,100
I'm sorry

703
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,100
I'm sorry

704
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,100
I'm sorry

705

I'm sorry

I'm sorry

718
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100
I'm sorry

719
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
I'm sorry

I'm so sorry

728
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Riddle Section

729
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,100
In between rivers

730
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Life and death

731
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:23,100
Only for the wind and the wind

732
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,100
The world is like a snowy mountain

733
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:32,100
How many years have passed

734
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:40,100
I have no one to share my life with

735
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,100
Only for the wind and the wind

736
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,100
The world is like a snowy mountain

737
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,100
How many years have passed
