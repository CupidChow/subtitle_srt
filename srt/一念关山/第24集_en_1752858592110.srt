00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,760
Zhu Yiwei is about the same.

4
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,720
Just now,

5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,840
I killed the left guard who wanted to destroy Jue'er.

6
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,240
But what he said before

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
made me feel very sad.

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,440
He said he surrendered to the prince

9
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,000
just to survive.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,920
Because His Majesty

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,520
never believed in Zhu Yiwei.

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,800
Even if he became a high-ranking guard,

13
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,760
he could only be a guard for two or three years.

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,080
Then he would be replaced.

15
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,320
They are right.

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,200
I have been in the left guard position

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
for more than a year.

18
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,720
All dead.

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,680
pays for the sacrifice.

20
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,080
In fact, they are all the same.

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
In our Majesty's embrace,

22
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,480
he's rash,

23
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
案eful, and원, and went to the Tian� bad.

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,040
All of it is to win over Zhang Song,

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,480
and to prove himself to the world

26
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,360
that he is an intersectionsugening emperor.

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
and sneaked into Tianmen Pass,

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
but he still didn't care.

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,280
He was thinking about

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,600
how to take over the country.

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,160
What should we do

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,040
to stop him?

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,520
How about

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,320
we go straight to the tower

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,600
and force your master to write a blood feud?

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,440
Ying can't do anything about it.

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,520
But we will definitely be fine.

38
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,560
No.

39
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,800
We still have to wait for Ying

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
to see Andie

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,640
and check the pass.

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
The Yongan Tower is heavily guarded.

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,840
If we hand over the gold,

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
we can let them go.

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
We don't have to risk our lives.

46
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
And I believe

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,320
Jin Mi Niang has already

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,280
sent the message to Chu.

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
In a few days,

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,240
Chu will send a letter to the State to question Andie.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,080
Why did he send the message

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,960
to Chu when he heard that Tianmen Pass is empty?

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,520
Once he knows that

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,000
Chu is already guarded,

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,680
he will probably stop for the time being.

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
Can you arrange someone from the Six Halls

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
to send a fake message?

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,560
Just say that the person who leaked the plan of Princess Chu

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is the eldest prince.

60
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,680
You want to

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,600
vent your anger on your disciple Li Tongguang?

62
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,040
Of course.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,880
Cheng Gui is dead.

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
It's unreasonable for him to be safe and sound.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,080
If Li Tongguang can have your master,

66
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,320
it means that he has burned the incense for the last life.

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,760
Of course.

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,640
I can have you.

69
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,400
I don't know how many lifetimes of incense I have burned.

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
You talk like a snake.

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
You learned it from the master, right?

72
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,160
What do you mean?

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm just saying it.

74
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,520
I heard about you,

75
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,200
Ji slash GuIu.

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,520
What?

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,600
Do you want to see望识icket?

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,180
I mean,

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,920
we'll have this shot

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
by the palace.

81
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
Anyway,

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
we must have the information

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,960
to check whiIe Zhangsun is safe.

84
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Almost.

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,240
Now he will also find me a way

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,920
Master Tang.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,640
Are your legs recovered?

88
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,040
They're fully recovered, Master Tang.

89
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
Tao'er, you still recognize me?

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
You've grown a lot.

91
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,840
Tao'er.

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,800
This is for you.

93
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
Okay, thanks.

94
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
This time I came here

95
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,320
to do something else.

96
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
Look.

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,200
This is our private hospital.

98
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
This is the Yong'an Tower His Majesty was asked to build.

99
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,200
Here.

100
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
And these streets.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
You'll have to...

102
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,760
What are you looking at?

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,080
Focus.

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,960
Here.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,480
Here.

106
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,080
And here.

107
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,400
Looking at them just now,

108
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,400
I want to ask who you are

109
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
and dare not say it.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm happy to think about it.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Why don't you just tell them

112
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,800
that I'm Ying's student?

113
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
I won't tell them.

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,160
They've been laughing at me

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,320
for not having a girlfriend.

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,040
Today,

117
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,080
I brought a beautiful girl.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,960
They must be so jealous of me.

119
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,840
Since the war between the two countries,

120
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,840
Zhu Yiwei has been searching

121
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,120
for Taoism in the安国境.

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
All of you who were secretly in the branch

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
didn't get hurt?

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,360
Yes.

125
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,960
They're smart.

126
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,360
They remember what I said back then.

127
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,360
When Tianmen Pass was attacked,

128
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,320
they hid themselves

129
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,400
with the identity they had prepared.

130
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,400
This is also the news

131
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
that I just got from the Taoist School.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,080
That's why I just got here.

133
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
You...

134
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,640
You're so talkative

135
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,960
when you see your brother.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
Life is so wonderful.

137
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,600
How wonderful?

138
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm a Zhu Yiwei.

139
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
I can hear you

140
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,480
singing in the Andu Hall one day.

141
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
It's really wonderful.

142
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
But just now,

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,280
when I was talking to them,

144
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,080
didn't you feel bored?

145
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
If I feel bored,

146
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,560
how are you going to make it up to me?

147
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,520
How do you want me to make it up to you?

148
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,720
I know.

149
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,160
Let's go.

150
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,440
I'll take you to a place

151
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,000
to make it up to you.

152
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,160
you treat him nice.

153
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,840
Really?

154
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,220
Just a bare face and a pair of

155
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,600
interviewened ankles.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,160
Then he becomesbreasted from his poor study

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,760
and a scarecrow.

158
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,280
Don't try to get him anything.

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
One thing,

160
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,800
I want him to give me hisւ.

161
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,280
Why can't she do that?

162
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I always thought that the outside of the face is like this.

163
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,480
The nose is like this.

164
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,880
Didn't you call me outside of the face? Look at you.

165
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,080
I just called you Madam. I didn't see you so happy.

166
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm not a Madam who never met anyone else.

167
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,480
In Chu, I'm still the Madam of the Prince Yongping.

168
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,080
What?

169
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
But that Prince's grave

170
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,080
I think there are already 30 holes.

171
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Madam, sorry to keep you waiting.

172
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Please.

173
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,080
Pick whatever you want.

174
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Take it away.

175
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,080
I don't like to wear something heavy and heavy.

176
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,080
What? Do you understand?

177
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,080
This one. This one looks heavy.

178
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,080
But it's light in the middle.

179
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,880
You don't like it? This one.

180
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,080
It's too light. It's not convenient to do anything.

181
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
This one. How about it?

182
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I don't want this one.

183
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,480
Look. This is a jade pendant from He Tian. The design is simple.

184
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
Try it.

185
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,880
After so many years, you still are still doing this.

186
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,280
This Madam is the master of this house.

187
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,880
Did you hear that? I'm the master of this house.

188
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,680
I only want one.

189
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
You like it so much. Why don't you pick it yourself?

190
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,280
This is a daughter's item. How can I, a man, wear it?

191
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
I already picked a gift for you.

192
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
If I were you, I would be so happy.

193
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,480
Then I can pick one for you too.

194
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,080
Yes, you can. But these are all for daughters.

195
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,680
Next time, I'll let you pick one for me. Next time, I'll let you pick one for me.

196
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,280
This one. Look. Look at this one.

197
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,880
Boss.

198
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Boss.

199
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,680
Please forgive me for not being able to recognize you.

200
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,880
Please come to the back yard and have a seat.

201
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
This way, please.

202
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,280
Madam, what's going on?

203
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Tell me. What's wrong?

204
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,680
The jade pendant hanging here is a regular decoration from the Shadong tribe.

205
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,480
The Empress is a daughter of the Shadong tribe.

206
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,480
In order to make things easier, she arranged for me to be her niece.

207
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
The tribe will meet and make a jewelry and a family gift.

208
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
Then they will be able to get along with each other.

209
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,280
So that's what's going on.

210
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,280
What does the bead mean?

211
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,280
The silver bead. Meiniang gave it to me.

212
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,680
She was afraid that it would be inconvenient for me to wear it after I came here.

213
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,480
So she prepared some for me.

214
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,680
Not much. Each bead can be used to buy 50 taels of gold at the Golden Sand House.

215
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,880
50 taels?

216
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,480
Madam, you're really rich.

217
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,880
I see. After all, this place is my place.

218
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,480
Madam, you're right.

219
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Madam, please.

220
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,080
You're not really going to give me jewelry, are you?

221
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,480
There's not only jewelry here.

222
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
That's right.

223
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,280
How is it?

224
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
The jade pendant.

225
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
I don't think the color suits you.

226
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,880
No, you picked it, didn't you?

227
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,280
I picked another set.

228
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,680
But I think this color suits Shisan.

229
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,080
I'll buy it and give it to her.

230
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,480
How is it? A fresh wind blows.

231
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,680
Change to another one. Not bad.

232
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Change to another one.

233
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,480
The one you just bought.

234
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,280
You're still changing?

235
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Can you really do that?

236
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
I like it.

237
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,480
This color is too much.

238
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,080
It looks good.

239
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm the owner of this hall. I'm dressed like a groom.

240
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
That's it.

241
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
So domineering.

242
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,280
Try it.

243
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Lower your head.

244
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Lower it a little more.

245
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,680
Are you satisfied?

246
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,280
Turn around and take a look.

247
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
Boss.

248
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,280
Yes.

249
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
The ones I wanted just now.

250
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,880
I'll take them.

251
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,080
The ones I wanted just now.

252
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,480
Put this on and send it to the Golden Mountain House.

253
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
They'll know how to deal with it.

254
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
Yes.

255
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Yuan Bai.

256
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,680
Let's go.

257
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Yes, Madam.

258
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Gu Yuan Bai is really not easy.

259
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,080
It's tiring to try on clothes.

260
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,680
It's like taking off a layer of skin.

261
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
As long as you're tired.

262
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Men like to take their wives to the shops.

263
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,880
It looks like they care about her and pity her.

264
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,280
It's just dressing her up as a doll.

265
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,880
They're just looking for happiness.

266
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,680
Today, I'll let you try this kind of taste.

267
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,680
No.

268
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,880
You're saying that because you seem to have a lot of experience.

269
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,280
Do you have any opinions?

270
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,080
I don't dare to have any.

271
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,880
I think you're also very familiar with picking jewelry.

272
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,280
It's probably not the first time.

273
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,480
I used to be a jewelry merchant.

274
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
I have to know this.

275
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,080
But picking for a woman you love

276
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,480
is really the first time.

277
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,280
Gu Yuan Bai,

278
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,480
Gu Yuan Bai,

279
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,280
you really only worked as a jewelry merchant.

280
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,680
You never worked in any other industry.

281
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
For example?

282
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
For example,

283
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,680
face-to-face,

284
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
and manly.

285
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,280
How is that possible?

286
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,080
How could I have done that?

287
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,280
Do I deserve to be like this?

288
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,280
Only you pampered me.

289
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,480
Really?

290
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,280
Of course.

291
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
When you were changing your new clothes,

292
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,680
you looked quite handsome.

293
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,080
I'm just cooperating.

294
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,480
Don't talk about me. Do you like this hairpin?

295
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,280
I like it. If I don't like it, why would I wear it?

296
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,080
It's good that you like it.

297
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,280
Okay, Gu Yuan Bai.

298
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,880
I won't trouble you anymore.

299
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
Let's talk about something serious.

300
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
Okay.

301
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,080
I want to check the situation of Second Prince's manor

302
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,280
and see if Her Highness is okay.

303
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,480
Old Ning, you're finally back.

304
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,280
What's wrong?

305
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,680
New clothes?

306
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,880
New hairpin?

307
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
You two...

308
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,880
Where did you take her? Tell me.

309
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,080
Ignore her.

310
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,480
Sit.

311
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,680
That's great. You changed your face when you were changing your hairpin.

312
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,080
Do you think you can take away the first man of my Six Halls, the elegant one?

313
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,680
I don't want to take away anything from you.

314
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,080
But if you have family to take care of,

315
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,080
someone will buy you clothes.

316
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,680
Ruyi.

317
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,680
We're leaving, first man.

318
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,880
One is cruel, the other is more cruel.

319
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
Do you want to kill everyone?

320
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,680
I want a new hairpin too.

321
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,280
Buy me one. I want one too.

322
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Why does he look like Nian Gao?

323
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,080
My Lord, calm down.

324
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
I know.

325
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
I still want to work with Ning Yuan Zheng.

326
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Cocoproced13?

327
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,280
I'm talking.

328
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,280
Do you know?

329
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,080
Even if I knew they were together,

330
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,880
when I close my eyes,

331
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,380
I can still open bread.

332
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,280
You guys rile me up.

333
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,700
Are you fine, Yun?

334
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,260
I can't.

335
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,840
Doctor,

336
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm fine.

337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,300
The wound at the time was Roberts jelly too.

338
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,720
Then why did you fight with Dang Pan이야

339
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,160
My god.

340
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,080
Doctor, are you okay?

341
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,420
I wouldn't hurt you.

342
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,940
I'll show you.

343
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,680
Are you서 quite brazen-faced?

344
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,380
How dare Li Changxin take the laundry!

345
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,160
Yourile, I large about burglary...

346
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,880
and ordered us to beبر Velisch.

347
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
only one of the Zhu Yi Wei clan in the capital.

348
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
I don't want to hear any other news

349
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
before I fall into this position.

350
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Are you trying to disobey the decree?

351
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
His Majesty said

352
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
that the entire court

353
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,880
can't mention the name of that thief.

354
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Did I mention it?

355
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,880
May I ask who this traitor is?

356
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
May I know?

357
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Chang Qing Hou,

358
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
just take it.

359
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
I came here today

360
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
to make trouble for you.

361
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
I was assassinated in He County.

362
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Who was the mastermind behind it?

363
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Lord Deng.

364
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Shouldn't you know it clearly?

365
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Didn't you send someone

366
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,880
to kill the mastermind behind it?

367
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
What else do you want?

368
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Didn't you send someone

369
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
to kill the mastermind behind it?

370
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Guess.

371
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Lord Deng,

372
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
this man

373
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
sneaked into our headquarters

374
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
without knowing it.

375
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
He even tried to revenge for Chang Qing Hou.

376
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
But Chang Qing Hou

377
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
seemed to be completely unaware of it.

378
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Do you think he is

379
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
the previous one?

380
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

381
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
You finally come back.

382
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't dare.

383
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Who do you think did it?

384
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
I received a notice

385
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
and was making trouble along the way.

386
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Don't talk nonsense.

387
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Yes.

388
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I think

389
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
the one who killed the mastermind

390
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
should be the mastermind himself.

391
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
The mastermind was so depressed

392
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
that he colluded with the North Plains

393
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
to assassinate Chang Qing Hou.

394
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Seeing Chang Qing Hou return safely,

395
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
you came to the palace under the order

396
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
and most likely

397
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
caused the Eastern Window to be exposed.

398
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
In order to protect the mastermind behind it,

399
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
he was lucky

400
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
to play such a trick with his life.

401
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
In this way,

402
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
he could confuse the world

403
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
and give His Majesty

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
an explanation for committing suicide.

405
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
You are really smart.

406
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Okay.

407
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Then you will find out

408
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
the mastermind behind it in seven days.

409
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Otherwise...

410
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Yes.

411
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,880
The Chou Yi Wei are all annoying women.

412
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
There is only one man

413
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
who can live with them.

414
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
He is gone.

415
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
He is gone.

416
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
What should we do?

417
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Your Majesty, don't panic.

418
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
At least, the commander

419
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
hasn't suspected

420
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
that the three-headed woman

421
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
and the three thousand taels of gold

422
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
are involved.

423
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
The assassination of Chang Qing Hou

424
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
has nothing to do with us.

425
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
No.

426
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
You don't understand.

427
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
That assassin

428
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
could only be him.

429
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Who?

430
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
The Chou Yi Wei from five years ago

431
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
is a man.

432
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
He is a man.

433
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
He is a man.

434
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
He is a man.

435
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
He is a man.

436
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
I am sorry.

437
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Master.

438
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Thank you.

439
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Thank you for taking revenge for me.

440
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
I knew

441
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
in your heart

442
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
I have always been the most important one.

443
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Master.

444
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Master, you are so nice.

445
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
In the future,

446
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
you should learn the strategy,

447
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
the ice method,

448
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
and the knowledge.

449
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
If you have a family,

450
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
someone will give you a dress.

451
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,880
But why are you so close to Ning Yuan?

452
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
I have been

453
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
carefully choosing

454
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
those rings for a long time.

455
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
And you

456
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
are wearing

457
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
the ring he gave you.

458
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Master.

459
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Tell me.

460
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Is it you?

461
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Is it you?

462
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Tell me.

463
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Go.

464
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I don't know why you are here.

465
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
I dare to ask you

466
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
what you are doing here.

467
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
I heard you came back safely.

468
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Father asked me to bring some gifts

469
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
to visit you.

470
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
You are so considerate and considerate.

471
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
I am very grateful.

472
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Please tell the Prime Minister

473
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
that I will be here in a few days.

474
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Yes.

475
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
You are welcome.

476
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Did you really meet

477
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
the North Chinese attack

478
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
in He County that day?

479
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Yes.

480
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
You are really considerate.

481
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I asked for my father's help.

482
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
I didn't want to know it myself.

483
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
In a few days,

484
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
I will write a letter

485
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
to report the matter to the Prime Minister.

486
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Is there anything else?

487
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Li Rong Guang, what do you mean?

488
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
You are so impatient.

489
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
You said you looked down on me last time.

490
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I didn't mind you later.

491
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
I brought gifts today

492
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
and dressed up specially.

493
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
I have already given you face.

494
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
If father admitted that

495
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
the marriage has been arranged,

496
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
it will be a long-term plan

497
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
to get along well.

498
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
I...

499
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
I feel sorry for you.

500
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
I am sorry.

501
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Don't worry, Your Highness.

502
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
I will go to the Duke's Mansion tomorrow.

503
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
By then,

504
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
we will be able to meet

505
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
and get along well.

506
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Li Rong Guang,

507
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
if you still want to

508
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
marry me,

509
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
you'd better be polite to me.

510
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
I met something

511
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
and I am in a bad mood.

512
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
You are in a bad mood

513
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
and you are angry at me.

514
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Who do you think I am?

515
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
I am too lazy to act with you.

516
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I will go back and tell father today

517
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
that you just don't respect me.

518
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
You just bully me.

519
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I just don't agree

520
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
with this marriage.

521
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Fine.

522
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
You can go.

523
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
You are already twenty years old.

524
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Why do you still

525
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
not marry me?

526
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Don't you know?

527
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
It's not because you are good-looking

528
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
or because you are from a noble family.

529
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
It's because you like to

530
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
practice martial arts and swordsmanship.

531
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Your father

532
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
can't find a suitable person

533
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
and he won't let His Majesty

534
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
suspect his son-in-law

535
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
to marry you.

536
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Do you think you will always

537
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
be the pearl of Sha Xi Tribe?

538
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
You are wrong.

539
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Your brother won't like

540
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
a sister who

541
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
always wants to

542
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
take advantage of her power.

543
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Jin Ming,

544
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
do you always want to

545
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
stay at the Prime Minister's mansion

546
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
and let your father worry

547
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
about your marriage

548
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
year after year?

549
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Or

550
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
you are willing to

551
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
endure the insults of your elder sister-in-law

552
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
and then hurt your brother and sister

553
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
and then hurt your brother and sister

554
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
and then hurt your brother and sister

555
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Li Tong Guang, you...

556
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
I will never

557
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
do anything to you.

558
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Let's go.

559
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Your Highness,

560
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
I will put you in a difficult position.

561
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
But please don't look down on me.

562
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I won't ask for it.

563
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
In the future, we will have a good show

564
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
of loving and loving husband and wife.

565
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
After we get married,

566
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
I promise you

567
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,880
that I will let you hold on to the position of the Marquis.

568
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,880
I will never interfere with your freedom.

569
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Freedom?

570
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
What freedom?

571
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Find a face

572
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
and then give birth to a

573
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
unborn child's freedom.

574
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Okay?

575
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Okay.

576
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Of course,

577
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
if you are willing,

578
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
let alone one,

579
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
eight out of ten is not a problem.

580
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
In the future,

581
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I will choose for you this time.

582
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
I promise it's the best.

583
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
The End

584
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Your Grace.

585
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,960
Your Grace, slow down.

586
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,960
Why does she treat me like that?

587
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Why?

588
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,920
Don't be too angry, Your Grace.

589
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,880
If you want to get along with

590
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,440
Chang Qing Hou in the future...

591
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,640
Get along with him?

592
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,360
Who wants to get along with him?

593
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,240
He's arrogant and arrogant.

594
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
He looks down on me?

595
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
He looks down on me?

596
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

597
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Your Grace,

598
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,240
the other secret has been revealed.

599
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
The four guards

600
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
have their own plans.

601
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
They are all going to be killed.

602
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
I'm sure they will.

603
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I'm sure they will.

604
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I'm sure they will.

605
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
I'm sure they will.

606
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I'm sure they will.

607
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
The guards are guarding.

608
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
And here.

609
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
The defense here is too hidden.

610
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
We can't get in at all.

611
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Zhu Yi.

612
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
The people of Golden Sand Gang

613
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
suddenly contacted our outside subordinates.

614
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
They asked me to bring you a message.

615
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
They asked you to go out

616
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
and look southwest.

617
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
What is that?

618
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
A new case of Zhu Yi Wei.

619
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
A secret.

620
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Someone asked me out.

621
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Today, at this time,

622
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
I met him at the temple in the south of the city.

623
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
The snake came out of the hole.

624
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
I left that sentence

625
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
in my stomach

626
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
to lure him out.

627
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
It seems that

628
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
it's not Deng Hui

629
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
but Jialin.

630
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Why?

631
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
This kind of secret

632
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
was only used by

633
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
the white swans back then.

634
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
The white swans

635
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
are not here.

636
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
They are not here.

637
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
They are not here.

638
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
They are not here.

639
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
They are not here.

640
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
They are not here.

641
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
They are not here.

642
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
They are not here.

643
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
They are not here.

644
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
They are not here.

645
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
They are not here.

646
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
They are not here.

647
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
They are not here.

648
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
They are not here.

649
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
They are not here.

650
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
You are really

651
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
unstoppable.

652
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
You don't remember me.

653
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
I am Lin Ji.

654
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
But now,

655
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
I am still a child.

656
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
I changed my name

657
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
and called it Jialin

658
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
because

659
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
I don't want anyone

660
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
to call me by the title

661
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
I always know.

662
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
Just for the sake of Xu Jiu

663
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,040
I came here alone

664
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,240
to confess one thing to you

665
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,040
The one who sold the Wudu branch to the six Daos

666
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,840
and issued the order to destroy the sect

667
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,640
It's me

668
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,240
The上封有令,不得不走

669
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,640
You mean

670
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,240
Deng Hui forced you with his life

671
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,840
He forced you to sell dozens of subordinates

672
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,240
It's a gambling

673
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,040
If I don't know what to do

674
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,240
How can Deng Hui believe

675
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I'd willingly submit to him

676
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,240
Have you checked his resume?

677
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,440
His father

678
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
was killed by Bai Que

679
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
He hated Zhu Yi Wei

680
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
But the Emperor was afraid that Zhu Yi Wei would be too big

681
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
He sent him to take over this place

682
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
A Xin

683
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
When he hinted at me

684
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
to take the money from the merchant

685
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
and save it to the three thousand gold

686
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
and kill the Wudu branch

687
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
I was so scared

688
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
I had to do it

689
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
If it was before

690
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
I would have left alone

691
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
But now

692
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
But now

693
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
You are pregnant

694
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Only four months

695
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,240
There are four feelings in the stomach

696
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
So

697
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
I have been hiding it

698
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
in my stomach

699
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Enough

700
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
You say this just to move me

701
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
You know

702
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
I never killed pregnant women

703
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
I never killed pregnant women

704
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Not only that

705
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Do you know why the Emperor decided

706
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
that you killed the late queen?

707
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
It was Deng Hui

708
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
At that time

709
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
He was the leader of the imperial flying cavalry camp

710
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
He bribed the late queen

711
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
A Bi, the personal maid

712
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Let him come out to testify

713
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
It was you who gave the late queen a bad idea

714
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Let him kill the late queen

715
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
And make the emperor

716
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
make the second prince the crown prince

717
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
So the late queen went to the Yaoyue Tower

718
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
The emperor thought it was you who provoked Li Jian

719
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
So he didn't have to

720
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
put you in the prison

721
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Impossible

722
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I don't believe

723
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
I swear with my child

724
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
I don't have a word of falsehood

725
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
A Xin, that's good

726
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Today the emperor went out of the palace to pray

727
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
The guards

728
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
also have our注意卫

729
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
You and I

730
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Go to the street lamp meeting

731
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
To wash away your grievance, okay?

732
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Where is the emperor's prayer?

733
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Nan Da Si

734
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Go this way

735
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
You still don't believe me

736
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
I think I will ambush you

737
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Follow you

738
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Stop

739
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Nan Da Si is ahead

740
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,240
Ew

741
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Do you find anything wrong?

742
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
First

743
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
By the road that I brought you

744
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,640
There are many peaches and peaches by your side.

745
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,120
The pregnant woman is most afraid of peaches and peaches.

746
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,480
But you didn't even make a move to turn them around.

747
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,080
That means that you have no source at all.

748
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:33,960
Secondly, you were so

749
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,440
You were the one who took people to attack me

750
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,720
when I was in the Demon Moon Tower.

751
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,960
You even said that you would leave me a body.

752
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,760
I never trust my enemies.

753
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,040
Yanyan!

754
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,080
What?

755
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,760
You heard it.

756
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,240
