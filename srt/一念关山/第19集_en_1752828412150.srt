1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
Soan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind blows the clouds and the clouds are hidden

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,220
The

4
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,220
clouds are so beautiful

5
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,220
The wind blows the clouds and the clouds are hidden

6
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,220
The clouds are so beautiful

7
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,220
The wind blows the clouds and the clouds are hidden

8
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,220
The clouds are so beautiful

9
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,220
The clouds are so beautiful

10
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,220
The clouds are so beautiful

11
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,220
The clouds are so beautiful

12
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,220
The clouds are so beautiful

13
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:04,220
The Clouds of Noir

14
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
Episode 13

15
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Besides,

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,220
Ruyi is a swordsman.

17
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,220
If you ask her to meet with Chang Qing,

18
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,220
I think she may not feel the same.

19
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Sir.

21
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,220
Do you know how much effort I've put into it

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,220
to make myself hold back from attacking you?

23
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
Sir Ning.

24
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,220
Sir Ning. Sir Ning.

25
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,220
Next, listen to me.

26
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,220
I won't repeat myself.

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,220
First,

28
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,220
a woman can't sell her items at random.

29
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,220
I've never let a woman sell her body.

30
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
It's even more so in the delegation.

31
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,220
Second,

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Ruyi's martial arts skills are far better than mine.

33
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,220
I know her very well.

34
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,220
How could I give her to someone else?

35
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,220
What you said just now

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,220
was a huge insult to me and her.

37
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,220
Sir Ning.

38
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
Third,

39
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
I could die for the sake of the past.

40
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,220
But Ruyi doesn't have that responsibility.

41
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,220
She has already paid a heavy price for you, me, the Crown Prince, and everyone.

42
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
Sir Du.

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,220
If you ever mention this again,

44
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,220
don't blame me for not respecting our friendship.

45
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,220
Okay.

46
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
Please pass on my order.

47
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,220
From now on,

48
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,220
if anyone dares to use Marquis Changqing and Ruyi as enemies,

49
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,220
you are my enemy.

50
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Okay.

51
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
Yes.

52
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,220
Ruyi,

53
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,220
why do you think Sir Du would think that way?

54
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,220
You saved his life before.

55
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,220
And after you brought me back,

56
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,220
he even said that it was all thanks to you.

57
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,220
I always thought that he was a good person

58
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,220
for being patient and taught me.

59
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,220
It's one thing to be grateful for my life-saving grace.

60
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,220
It's another thing to be convinced that

61
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
when a woman is with a man,

62
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
it's another thing.

63
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
After all,

64
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,220
that's what they've been telling me all this time.

65
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
Didn't Zheng Qingyun also think that

66
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,220
as long as he cooked rice with you,

67
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,220
you would listen to him?

68
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
There are only a few men

69
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,220
who can think like you, Yuanzhou.

70
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
Then, Ruyi,

71
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Brother Yuanzhou has been protecting you so much in front of others.

72
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Can you stop being mad at him?

73
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
There has never been a man

74
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
who has been protecting me like him.

75
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
I'm very grateful.

76
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,220
But there are some things

77
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,220
that we need to think about more clearly

78
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
so that we can know

79
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,220
if we can continue to be together.

80
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,220
Then,

81
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,220
I'll think with you.

82
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
Can you think clearly?

83
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,220
Of course I can.

84
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Although I have a small brain,

85
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
I have a big brain.

86
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
But, Ruyi,

87
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
do you know that

88
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,220
Brother Yuanzhou is really pitiful.

89
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
These two days,

90
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,220
he's been sitting there alone

91
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,220
drinking boredom and taking advantage of it to get rid of his worries.

92
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
And when he was talking to us,

93
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,220
he was not even thinking.

94
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,220
He just said that he was smart and smart.

95
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Now he's lying to me.

96
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,220
I know Ning Yuanzhou.

97
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,220
If he really wants to drink alone,

98
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,220
he won't let you know.

99
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
Even if he feels bad,

100
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,220
he won't get into a bad mood.

101
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Because I'm like that too.

102
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
Tell me.

103
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
You know each other so well.

104
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,220
But you still have such a bad mood.

105
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Because we all really like each other.

106
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
If we want to go on for a long time,

107
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,220
we can't be confused

108
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,220
and jump over the same problems.

109
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,220
So that's how it is.

110
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
But Ruyi,

111
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
I still miss you guys

112
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
like you have your own baby.

113
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,220
You look like you.

114
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
And your eyes look like Brother Yuanzhou.

115
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,220
How pretty and fun.

116
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
I like it so much.

117
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,220
What?

118
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,220
Ning,

119
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,220
why are you so stubborn at the critical moment?

120
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,220
I heard it.

121
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,220
You two have a lot of problems.

122
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,220
You have to be careful with your wife.

123
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,220
Once she gets angry,

124
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
everything will be fine.

125
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,220
It's not about being careful.

126
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,220
We're not arguing.

127
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,220
But if this relationship wants to go on for a long time,

128
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,220
we have to think about it.

129
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,220
This is the greatest respect for this relationship.

130
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,220
Respect?

131
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
It's not business.

132
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,220
You have to act like an enemy.

133
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,220
The most important thing for two people to be together

134
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,220
is to throw away the unhappiness and distrust in your heart.

135
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,220
That's how it lasts.

136
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,220
If you keep doing this,

137
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,220
don't blame me for not caring about my brother's feelings.

138
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Let's start first.

139
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
Just you?

140
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Li Tongguang is more powerful,

141
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,220
younger, handsome, and more infatuated than you.

142
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
Ruyi doesn't even like him.

143
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
Why does he like you?

144
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,220
So you know Li Tongguang is more powerful,

145
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,220
younger, handsome, and more infatuated than you.

146
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,220
You always say that a beauty is not happy with the world and doesn't know how to feel.

147
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,220
I think you're not as good as her.

148
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,220
Feelings,

149
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,220
once you understand these things,

150
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,220
it's a thousand miles a day.

151
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,220
To put it bluntly,

152
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,220
the only person in our delegation who is difficult is the one who is more like you.

153
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,220
And I, Yu Shisan,

154
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
know the most about gentleness and filial piety.

155
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,220
If you don't cherish it,

156
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,220
just wait and see the water drop.

157
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
You dare?

158
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Why wouldn't I dare?

159
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,220
I dare. I dare.

160
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
Don't forget,

161
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,220
Jin Mi Niang,

162
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
she won't let you off.

163
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,220
What?

164
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,220
You're going to find Marquis Changqing in person?

165
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
Yes.

166
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
And I'm going to do it now.

167
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
I'm not going to Feiliye.

168
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,220
After all, Marquis Changqing

169
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,220
has visited me twice.

170
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Now that I'm healthy,

171
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,220
I should go to his residence and see.

172
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,220
Don't worry.

173
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,220
I'll go to his residence and see.

174
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
I'll go to his residence and see.

175
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
I'll go to his residence and see.

176
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Don't worry.

177
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Marquis Changqing is suspicious.

178
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,220
He'll find excuses to refuse to see.

179
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
In this way,

180
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,220
I can also go to see the background of the An family.

181
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,220
I can also go to see the background of the An family.

182
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
No, no.

183
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,220
Your Highness, you should discuss with me.

184
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,220
Why do you come to the court yourself?

185
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,220
You didn't seem to discuss with me just now.

186
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,220
You didn't seem to discuss with me just now.

187
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,220
So you asked Lord Ning to discuss the secret matter without permission.

188
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,220
So you asked Lord Ning to discuss the secret matter without permission.

189
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,220
I'll tell you all.

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,220
I'll tell you all.

191
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
No matter how many mistakes

192
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,220
I made before,

193
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
please don't forget,

194
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
I'm the

195
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,220
Ying Di Envoy that the people of An want.

196
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,220
Ying Di Envoy that the people of An want.

197
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Please don't disturb me

198
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,220
in any important business

199
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
in the future.

200
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,220
Please don't disturb me

201
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
in any important business

202
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
in the future.

203
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,220
I will go first and thank you.

204
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
Your Highness, you can't do that.

205
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,220
Your Highness, I will remember your order.

206
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,220
Miss Ruyi, I was too careless and made a big mistake.

207
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Please forgive me.

208
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,220
I didn't make this decision.

209
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,220
It was your sudden intention.

210
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,220
I will escort you.

211
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
Lord Ning.

212
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Lord Du, the people of An are bullying us.

213
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Don't you want to teach them a lesson?

214
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,220
I...

215
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
I will go with you.

216
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,220
I was planning to take you to see the Queen of Changqi tomorrow.

217
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,220
It's better to go now.

218
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,220
It's not easy.

219
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,240
I can also visit the

220
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,220
empty rooms over there.

221
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Okay.

222
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,220
Are you going?

223
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Yes.

224
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,220
But I am the Princess now.

225
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
I am not suitable to meet her casually.

226
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
I will wait for you in the car.

227
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,220
I will protect you.

228
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,220
Did you find the book?

229
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,220
I just persuaded Wanru Sister.

230
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,220
I haven't found the chance yet.

231
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
It's okay.

232
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,220
Go and see the Queen of Changqi.

233
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
You will be happy.

234
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,220
We will have a chance.

235
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
This Queen of Changqi is so annoying.

236
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,220
She was the one who had a fight with Brother Yuan Zhou.

237
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Yesterday, the people of An came.

238
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,220
We have no way to deal with the Cang Hwang.

239
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,220
If we can't get our strength back today,

240
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,220
we will be in trouble when we arrive in An.

241
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,220
So we have to be strict today.

242
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Act quickly.

243
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Protect the Princess.

244
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Do you understand?

245
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,220
Yes.

246
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Let's go.

247
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Please.

248
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,220
Please.

249
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,220
Did you really drink and have an old injury?

250
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
No.

251
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,220
Don't listen to them.

252
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
It's okay.

253
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,220
I...

254
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
When did we talk nonsense?

255
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,220
Please understand.

256
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
We can't talk nonsense.

257
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
There must be someone.

258
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Please.

259
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,220
Please.

260
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Please.

261
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Please.

262
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,220
Please tell the King of Da Wu Li to come and pay his respects.

263
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
My Lord.

264
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,220
He is well now.

265
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
He is in good spirits.

266
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,220
He just wanted to come and find the power.

267
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,220
He has been to the gate and didn't see it.

268
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,220
It seems that we are a little weak.

269
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
You go and deal with them.

270
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Tell them that I have something to do.

271
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
No.

272
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Tell them that I went to the nearby restaurant and relaxed.

273
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Let them wait for an hour.

274
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
We will see them again.

275
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
Yes.

276
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,220
Please.

277
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
What a big shock.

278
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,220
It seems that the King of Li's illness is getting better.

279
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
What?

280
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Do you still expect me to continue to get sick?

281
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
I am kidding.

282
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
I am kidding.

283
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Your Highness is getting better.

284
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
I am very glad.

285
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
Please come inside and see me.

286
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
I dare to ask you.

287
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
I am the son of the King of Da Wu.

288
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
I should be very grateful.

289
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Is it possible that you are the son of the Red Crane Temple's guard Su Can?

290
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,220
You don't even know the honor of the king, right?

291
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,220
His Highness!

292
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,220
The Disha of Chijie's camp and the recyclable indeed.

293
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,220
Only you dare to entrable me.

294
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,220
Your Highness, calm down!

295
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:37,280
Oh,

296
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,220
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,220
You sound familiar.

298
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
The young lord came to the courthouse last time.

299
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,220
I'm just a phoenix.

300
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,220
You just arrived here and you're busy.

301
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
But you're going out to have a look.

302
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,220
You're a good young general.

303
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
But you said

304
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,220
the river is not good.

305
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,220
It's better not to get any bad luck.

306
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Since you don't want to see me,

307
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
I'll come again tomorrow.

308
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
After all,

309
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,220
he came to greet me twice.

310
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,220
I'll come again.

311
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
He deserves it.

312
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Goodbye.

313
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Your Highness.

314
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,220
Your Highness.

315
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
See His Highness back.

316
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Yes.

317
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
How did I do?

318
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,220
Not bad.

319
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,220
He wants me to eat the closed-door soup.

320
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I have to do something about him.

321
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
I forgot he's your apprentice.

323
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,220
It's okay.

324
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,220
You react quickly and respond well.

325
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
You've done a good job.

326
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,220
Did I make progress again?

327
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Don't call me.

328
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
Go.

329
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Master.

330
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
My Lord.

331
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
I was just trying to share something.

332
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
My Lord.

333
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Did you find anything about Princess Hu Yang?

334
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,220
Lord of the Wu State does have a daughter, Princess Hu Yang.

335
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,220
But the Zhu Yiwei's division of the Wu State has been greatly damaged.

336
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,220
We can't be sure if Princess Hu Yang is a princess or not.

337
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,220
But since Prince Li left Wudu,

338
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,220
Princess Hu Yang has been with him.

339
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
She takes good care of Prince Li.

340
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
She's a good girl.

341
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
She's a good apprentice.

342
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
An apprentice?

343
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
My Lord.

344
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,220
How can she be my apprentice?

345
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
My Lord.

346
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Didn't you say she's not a master?

347
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,220
She...

348
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,220
I don't care if she's a master or not.

349
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,220
In this world, my master can only be good to me.

350
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,220
Send a message to the nuclear commander Wu Qian.

351
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
Tell him to send a whole army to the camp.

352
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,220
Tomorrow, I'll bring a guest to the camp.

353
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
Yes.

354
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
Write a memorial letter to him.

355
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Tell him that I'm sorry for what I did today.

356
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Tomorrow at four o'clock,

357
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
I'll be at the camp for a dinner party.

358
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,220
I'll invite Prince Li and Princess Hu Yang to come.

359
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
A dinner party?

360
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,220
You even asked Miss Ruyi to come.

361
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
You're so determined.

362
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
I just want to go for a walk.

363
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Right.

364
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
I'm here to change the bottle.

365
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
Thank you.

366
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Oh, and this.

367
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,220
Take a look.

368
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Come in.

369
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
Sit.

370
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,220
This guy was hurt tonight by Ying's words.

371
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
He's trying to get out of bed.

372
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,220
He's trying to get back his face tomorrow.

373
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,220
Will you go?

374
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Yes.

375
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Otherwise, I don't know what he'll do to Ying.

376
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
He's been a little weird since he was a kid.

377
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
He's better now.

378
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
It's much better.

379
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
Take your medicine.

380
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
What's wrong?

381
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Nothing.

382
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,220
It's a pre-trial drug?

383
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,220
You haven't taken the antidote yet.

384
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
It's okay.

385
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,220
We're a few days late because of Zheng Qi Yun.

386
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
Don't worry.

387
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,220
We'll get the antidote when we get to Anguoguo County.

388
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
Zhang Song.

389
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
He knew anything could happen on the way.

390
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,220
You didn't go to get it.

391
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Can't he send someone to send it?

392
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,220
I don't think his control can be reached on time.

393
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
He must make me suffer.

394
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,220
They're all like this.

395
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,220
This is the reason why you want to stay away from the city.

396
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Nothing else.

397
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
You know that.

398
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,220
I've already seen the Qingya of Wuguo Court.

399
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,220
I made up my mind to kill him on the battlefield.

400
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:22,040
I don't want to waste my life for the sake of the

401
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,220
Qingya and the Qingya.

402
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
But don't get me wrong.

403
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
I'm not saying this to make you sympathize with me.

404
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,220
And then I'll trick you to live with me.

405
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
I know.

406
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,220
I'm not just being taken away by you.

407
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I also know that you are very hurt.

408
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
But in order to complete this mission,

409
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,220
you pretend nothing happened.

410
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,220
You laugh with everyone like before.

411
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,220
And you try to hide the fact that you've never met him.

412
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,220
You like me not only because I'm strong.

413
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,220
But also because I've been hurt like you.

414
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
You can warm up with me.

415
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
You don't have to hide it.

416
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,220
I just want to tell you that your heart is not cold.

417
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
It's always hot.

418
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
You don't like the Qingya of Wuguo Court.

419
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
You hate the traitors of Zhao.

420
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,220
But you can hear that Ying will be in danger.

421
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
You will be accused of being a traitor.

422
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
You will be promised the punishment.

423
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
You will be punished.

424
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,220
You promised Zhang Suo when your brothers were framed.

425
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Even if you are in a lot of pain,

426
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
you won't tell anyone.

427
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,220
You said you didn't want to be involved in other things.

428
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,220
But you always care about Yuan Lu's illness.

429
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,220
You worry about the people's livelihood and Ying's growth.

430
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Are you really cold?

431
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,220
You really want to leave?

432
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
You want to kill Yuan Lu, Yu Shisan and Sun Lang?

433
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:24,220
You want to leave Chen Yuan and go to a small island that you haven't been to.

434
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
I still think about it.

435
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,220
But you are right.

436
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,220
If they are in danger again,

437
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
I think I still can't do anything.

438
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Here you are.

439
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Pineapple candy.

440
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,220
It's for the weak.

441
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
Although the problem between us hasn't been solved,

442
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
we still have to eat the candy.

443
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Okay.

444
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
It's late.

445
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,220
You are sick.

446
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Go back and rest.

447
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,220
Okay.

448
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
That's it.

449
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
You will say something else besides good?

450
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,220
I think the problem between us will be solved.

451
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Because there is only one person in the world.

452
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
There is only one person in the world.

453
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
I'm leaving.

454
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
Love

455
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Love

456
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
I went out yesterday.

457
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,220
I made you run around.

458
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
I'm really sorry.

459
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,220
Thank you for your kindness.

460
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,220
I don't know what you think about my last suggestion.

461
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
You are anxious.

462
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Don't worry.

463
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,220
After the banquet, I will give you a satisfactory answer.

464
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,220
I hope you will like it.

465
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Your Highness, Princess.

466
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Please.

467
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Please.

468
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Do you understand?

469
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
I am good at math.

470
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,220
I only know this person is the one who plays the role of the king of the country.

471
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,220
I don't know about the other people.

472
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
They are the people of the Uyghur.

473
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
I don't know about them.

474
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
I don't know about them.

475
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
They are from the Uyghur.

476
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,220
They live in the mountains.

477
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
They have been living in the border for hundreds of years.

478
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,220
The people of both countries are afraid of them.

479
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
The previous emperor was also in the chaos.

480
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,220
So they have the right to take the country.

481
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,220
Chang Qinghou is really like a rat in the needle.

482
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,220
I think he is missing his father.

483
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,220
I don't know where your ancestors are.

484
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,220
Maybe one of my followers has your compatriot.

485
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Your Highness doesn't know the North Korean people.

486
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
But you should know these people.

487
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Bring them here.

488
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Go.

489
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
Hurry.

490
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
Go.

491
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Go.

492
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,220
Go.

493
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,220
Go.

494
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
Go.

495
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Go.

496
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,220
Go.

497
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
Go.

498
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,220
Go.

499
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,220
Go.

500
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Hurry.

501
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Go.

502
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Go.

503
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Go.

504
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
Hurry.

505
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Go.

506
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Go.

507
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
Hurry.

508
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,220
Go.

509
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Go.

510
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,220
General Yuan.

511
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
Tao Qian.

512
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Go.

513
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
Master Ning.

514
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
I am sorry.

515
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
I am ashamed of the people of Liudatang.

516
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
I am sorry.

517
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
I failed to protect the Chai Ming brothers.

518
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,220
I can only watch them die.

519
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Where are Chai Ming and the others?

520
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,220
In the forest of the Ghost Valley.

521
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,220
Stop.

522
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
Since you are the old people,

523
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,220
you should serve the guests.

524
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Kneel down.

525
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Kneel down.

526
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Kneel down.

527
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Take it.

528
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Take it.

529
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,220
Fire.

530
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Take it.

531
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Take it.

532
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Take it.

533
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,220
Take it.

534
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Fire.

535
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,220
Take it.

536
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Take it.

537
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
Enough.

538
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,220
Chang Qinghong.

539
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,220
Since you have been in charge of the peace talks,

540
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,220
why are you doing this?

541
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,220
Yesterday, you were quite arrogant.

542
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,220
Why are you so aggressive now?

543
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
I just let them have a drink.

544
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
I did nothing wrong.

545
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,220
Take it.

546
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,220
Take it.

547
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Take it.

548
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
Take it.

549
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
Take it.

550
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
Take it.

551
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Take it.

552
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Take it or not?

553
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
General Wu,

554
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,220
there are soldiers in your country who are being tortured in my Da Wu.

555
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,220
Do you want your comrades to be treated the same way?

556
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,220
You fought for my Da Wu.

557
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,220
You are my heroes.

558
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
We have no power.

559
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,220
How can we let you do this?

560
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
General Wu,

561
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
I am sorry.

562
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
I am sorry.

563
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
I am sorry.

564
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I am sorry.

565
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
We have no power.

566
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,220
How can we let the heroes do this for us?

567
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,220
General Yuan.

568
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
General Yuan.

569
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,220
Hell.

570
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Here are the heroes.

571
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Cheers!

572
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,220
Cheers.

573
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,540
Yao

574
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,860
Wait

575
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,780
Accounting

576
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Marquis Chang��

577
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,220
We are finished with our funnel

578
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,680
Can we say that we went back home for a rest?

579
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,340
Yes

580
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,340
But it's not good to serve the people.

581
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
Take it off.

582
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,340
The beauty will appreciate it.

583
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
Enough!

584
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,340
You keep changing my rules.

585
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,340
Chang Qing Hong,

586
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,340
was this how your master taught you?

587
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
Shut up!

588
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
A Ji!

589
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
Do you think you can be so casual

590
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
if you look like him?

591
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Come and don't go away.

592
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
If you have the ability,

593
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,340
kill me.

594
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,340
You've already poeticrral laying for rules.

595
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
Do it now.

596
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
If you don't like brotherhood

597
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,400
you should have the right to say苏

598
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,140
This is useless.

599
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,340
Sitting in front of me

600
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
is the things of a man and a dog.

601
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,340
How could you do this to us?

602
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
You are thoroughly disturbed.

603
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
You disdained our good intentions

604
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
and are making such a86

605
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,940
Your Highness, you are the ones who let them go.

606
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,140
We pay for it.

607
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,940
It's fair.

608
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,340
The play can go on.

609
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,140
If you don't want to play, then forget it.

610
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Let's go.

611
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
Stop them!

612
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,340
Don't move!

613
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Don't move!

614
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Your Highness.

615
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:10,340
Did Princess Hu Yang just say that she can represent one of your country's envoys?

616
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,340
What Sister said is what I think.

617
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,340
What I think is what the whole of Wu Country wants.

618
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,340
Very good.

619
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,340
In the future, the two countries will be able to meet again,

620
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,340
and I will be able to help.

621
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Chang Qing Hou doesn't want to talk to her.

622
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,340
If you lose your position in the Shadow Mirror,

623
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,340
I'm afraid everyone will think of your good reputation.

624
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Your Highness.

625
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,340
Whoever dares to stop us today is my enemy.

626
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Let's go.

627
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,340
Your Highness.

628
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,340
Did you see clearly?

629
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
Is she...

630
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,340
Let's go back first.

631
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,340
No need to talk about this.

632
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
You are heroes of the Wu Country.

633
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
You are worthy of being the Wang family of His Highness.

634
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Yes.

635
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
When we return to the inn,

636
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,340
I will hand over the room to you to recuperate.

637
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,340
Please.

638
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Be careful.

639
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Your Highness, please.

640
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Please.

641
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,340
This little bastard,

642
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
after a few years,

643
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
he has become more and more out of shape.

644
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,340
I think he has not remembered those cold changes in his mind.

645
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,340
He only knows how to play a strange trick.

646
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
We have been exploring him,

647
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,340
but the way he is now has suddenly changed.

648
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,340
I think he is going to become a demon after he meets you.

649
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,340
I believe that he will calm down in a short time

650
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
and treat his situation with a proper attitude.

651
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,340
When I just came here,

652
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,340
I met an old friend of Zhu Yi Wei.

653
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,340
Who is he?

654
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,340
He used to serve my maid, Liuli.

655
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,340
I am not sure if he recognized me

656
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,340
and I don't know if he will tell anyone else.

657
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
Is he still in Zhu Yi Wei?

658
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
I am not sure.

659
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,340
The matter of Qingfeng Temple has been going on for several days.

660
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,340
I believe that the headquarters of Zhu Yi Wei has already known.

661
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,340
Could he be the person Zhu Yi Wei sent to confirm your identity?

662
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,340
It is very possible.

663
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,340
But he did not wear the clothes of Zhu Yi Wei just now.

664
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
He might have gone directly to Li Tong Guang.

665
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
According to Meiniang's news,

666
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,340
Li Tong Guang and Zhu Yi Wei are almost not in contact.

667
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,340
We still have to be more careful.

668
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,340
Let's go back to the clinic first.

669
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,340
Tell me, is he our master?

670
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
Impossible.

671
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,340
His eyes, his back,

672
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,340
are exactly the same as our master.

673
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,340
His appearance is very similar to Master's.

674
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,340
But before the incident at the Demon Moon Tower,

675
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,340
Master was seriously injured.

676
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,340
His wound is here.

677
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,340
His body can be seen.

678
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,340
When I was serving,

679
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,340
I heard the imperial doctor's voice.

680
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,340
Even if it was a painting,

681
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,340
I could not remove the scars.

682
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,340
But I just saw it clearly.

683
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,340
On the thin frame of Princess Hu Yang,

684
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,340
there is nothing.

685
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
You lied to me.

686
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,340
There is someone who is so similar to him.

687
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,340
I must find a way to get him.

688
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,340
You!

689
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
You go teach him martial arts.

690
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,340
You go find Zhu Yi Wei's clothes.

691
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
You can't turn him into a master.

692
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,340
Did you hear me clearly?

693
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Did you hear me clearly?

694
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,340
Yes. Yes.

695
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,340
I promise you.

696
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,340
I will not let you go.

697
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
I promise you.

698
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,340
My master is back.

699
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,340
I can be with my master forever.

700
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,340
I will not let you go.

701
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
Come on.

702
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,340
Who is afraid that a dream will come true

703
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,340
just for the wind to come back?

704
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,340
The world is like a snow-covered cave.

705
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:29,340
How many years have passed?

706
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:37,340
I will not let you go.

707
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:49,340
I will not let you go.
