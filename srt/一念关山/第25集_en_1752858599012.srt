7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,440
In one incense, all the Yuling

8
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,440
will be touched

9
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Can you kill all of us in one incense?

10
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I can be the leader of the six Taoist temples

11
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Not only this

12
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
There is also this

13
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I tell you

14
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Jialing is the real murderer behind the unnoticed

15
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,440
We are here today to avenge them

16
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,440
So we will definitely take his life

17
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Now I will give you two ways

18
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,440
One, stay and die with him

19
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Two, you leave here immediately

20
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Just pretend you never came tonight

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Otherwise, even if you are lucky to live

22
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,880
You will be punished by Deng Hui tomorrow

23
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,880
As Jialing's accomplice

24
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Nonsense

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Don't listen to her

26
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I know you all blame Jialing

27
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
But from now on

28
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
I will only kill the evil

29
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
I will never bother you again

30
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
So it is

31
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Shanhu, Lu Ge

32
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Yes

33
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
I am willing to join the Zhu Yi Wei

34
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Is it a word that is difficult to follow?

35
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Yes

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
You didn't have a choice when you joined Zhu Yi Wei

37
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,880
But now you can make a choice

38
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
You don't listen to her

39
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Did you hear the horse?

40
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
The people of the Imperial Guard are coming soon

41
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
You are really stupid

42
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Did you forget

43
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Who is the general of the Imperial Guard now?

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
You are not a general

45
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
You are a murderer

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
You are a murderer

47
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Go

48
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Chang Qing Hou

49
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
The disciple of the Human Slave

50
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Over there

51
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Go

52
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Don't go

53
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Come back

54
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,320
Go

55
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Go

56
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
It's Master's shadow

57
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
My Lord

58
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
The scenery here is good

59
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,760
But it seems to be raining

60
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Since it rains

61
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
A lot of things will be rushed away

62
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Yes

63
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Remember

64
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
At this moment

65
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
The Imperial Guard of the Imperial Guard is not aware of the enemy

66
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
To the west of the river

67
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
See the six men and two women of the Zhu Yi Wei

68
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
No trace

69
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Died by internal fight

70
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Yes

71
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
You guessed it right again

72
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
She really didn't die

73
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Although I asked a lot of people

74
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,760
But I still want to hear you say it yourself

75
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Why do you want to do it to the entire Wu Du branch of the Zhu Yi Wei

76
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Just to cover up the three thousand two-channel attack

77
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
You are not afraid

78
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I am afraid

79
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
You are afraid

80
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Otherwise

81
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I can also learn to be a ghost

82
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Slaughtering prince

83
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
We are women

84
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Women from the Zhu Yi Wei

85
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
No tomorrow

86
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I have to plan for myself

87
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
So I want money

88
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
A lot of money

89
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,200
You ordered to kill my aunt and Linglong's family.

90
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Is it still important now?

91
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Important?

92
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
They are all living people.

93
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
They are all the seven women in the world.

94
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,200
But you sold 47 lives for that little money.

95
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
You were bought by us.

96
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
You are not a Korean.

97
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
It's none of your business.

98
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
You are still alive today.

99
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,200
You are still alive today.

100
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
I am in your hands today.

101
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
I am in your hands today.

102
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It doesn't mean you are innocent.

103
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Master Ning, you are fascinated by him.

104
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I tell you.

105
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
He is pretending.

106
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
He is like me.

107
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
He is from the white swans.

108
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
He is from the white swans.

109
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
He is always with men.

110
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
He is always with men.

111
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
He is always with men.

112
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
He has done a lot of things.

113
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
He doesn't say a word.

114
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
He doesn't say a word.

115
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
In my heart.

116
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
He has done a lot of things.

117
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
He has done a lot of things.

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
And I can tell you.

119
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
I am not a good person.

120
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
So we are a couple.

121
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Why?

122
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Why do you meet such a man?

123
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
And I...

124
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I tried my best to get him.

125
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Finally I am here.

126
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
But they always lie to me.

127
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
They always scold me.

128
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
They always look down on me.

129
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Why?

130
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
No one can do this to me.

131
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
No one can do this to me.

132
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
No one can do this to me.

133
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
No one can do this to me.

134
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
You think I am the murderer.

135
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
You think I am the murderer.

136
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
It's because of Deng Hui.

137
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I will tell you if you promise me one thing.

138
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Say it.

139
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
You disguised my body as a caravan.

140
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
It's Li Zhen who died without a single enemy.

141
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Why?

142
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
He wanted to learn the divine ghost.

143
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
After he died, he was trained to be a monk.

144
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
He was trained to be a monk.

145
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
He was trained to be a monk.

146
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
After he died, he was trained to be a monk.

147
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
The court can give him a title.

148
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
That's right.

149
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
I was killed because of me.

150
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I risked my life to get married.

151
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,200
But I don't want to die like other demons.

152
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I just want to be a symbol that was cut off.

153
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I want my brother to know

154
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm not the only one who can sell the color and the smell.

155
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I deserve the smile of the court.

156
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I won't let my family be ruined.

157
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
If you don't promise me,

158
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I will die.

159
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I promise you.

160
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,200
I will call the empress's spirit as my body.

161
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I will call the empress's spirit as my body.

162
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Okay.

163
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
I believe you.

164
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm telling you.

165
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
It's not a wait.

166
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Who is that?

167
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
It's a human heart.

168
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Why did you save the empress?

169
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
But she refused to leave with you.

170
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Who can let her die willingly?

171
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Tell me.

172
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Who is that?

173
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Don't you understand?

174
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Tell me.

175
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't forget.

176
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
You promised me.

177
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Tell me.

178
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Tell me.

179
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Tell me.

180
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
She's dead.

181
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Medicine. My medicine.

182
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Where's your medicine?

183
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Where's your blood?

184
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
She's dead.

185
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I want to know the answer.

186
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I must know the answer.

187
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
You already know the answer.

188
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
She's made it clear.

189
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I don't know. I don't know anything.

190
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
She lied to me.

191
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
She's always a hooligan.

192
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
She's lying to me.

193
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
You.

194
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
You already know the answer.

195
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
You just don't believe it.

196
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Otherwise, why didn't she tell you the name before she died?

197
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Why?

198
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Her Highness is so kind.

199
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
She's so kind.

200
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
She's so kind.

201
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Ruo Yu.

202
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Ruo Yu.

203
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Your Highness.

204
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Go.

205
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I won't go.

206
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Don't come over.

207
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Your Highness, go.

208
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You always listen to me.

209
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I order you to go.

210
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I order you to go to a new place.

211
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
To continue living happily for me.

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
But there's one thing you must remember.

213
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,200
In this life, don't fall in love with men easily.

214
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Your Highness.

215
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Your Highness.

216
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Your Highness.

217
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Your Highness.

218
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Your Highness.

219
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
It's time.

220
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
It's time to go.

221
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Qian Zhou.

222
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Help me take care of her.

223
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Don't worry.

224
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Your Majesty.

225
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Good night, Your Majesty.

226
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Your brother is still in prison.

227
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,200
How can you still smile?

228
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Your Majesty is wise.

229
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Let me welcome my brother back.

230
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
We can go home together soon.

231
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm happy to see that.

232
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,200
You're so clever.

233
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm really happy.

234
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
If it weren't for your virtue of life,

235
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I could have come back to the land.

236
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I might be a poor prince without any money.

237
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm so happy to see you off.

238
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,200
You don't care about your background.

239
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I know my place.

240
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Did you bring the gold?

241
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
50,000 gold is outside the palace.

242
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I'll give you the other 50,000 gold when you enter the border.

243
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
You dare to play this trick on me?

244
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Chang Qing Hou.

245
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Take the 50,000 gold.

246
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Yes.

247
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
When can I take you out of the tower?

248
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
I have other things to do.

249
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
We can talk about it later.

250
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Is it about the Northern Plains and the Southern Qing Dynasty?

251
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,200
How can I let others interfere in my state affairs?

252
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Your Highness, please.

253
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Even if it's not about the Northern Plains,

254
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
you shouldn't have taken the gold and continued to take the gold.

255
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
You took the gold and continued to take the gold to save His Majesty.

256
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Take him out.

257
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Your Majesty.

258
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Your Majesty.

259
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Your Majesty.

260
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,200
I know that you are in charge of my life.

261
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
But please allow me to say one last word.

262
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Say it.

263
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
If you still want to go to another country,

264
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,200
sending my brother and I back to the land is the right way.

265
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Why did Your Majesty take the victory in Tianmen Pass

266
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
but failed to win the battle?

267
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
It's because the Yang family is in the south.

268
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Although they lost, they still have the strength.

269
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Your country is just a small country.

270
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
If you continue to attack, you will be defeated.

271
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Now my brother has become the next king.

272
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Why didn't you take his life

273
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
but let the king take the gold to save the people?

274
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
It's because this battle has also dragged out His Majesty's treasury.

275
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
His Majesty hopes to take the country soon.

276
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,200
So you need my gold

277
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
to make the next battle.

278
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
But His Majesty, although the gold is heavy,

279
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
it can be loyal to the king.

280
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Now everyone knows that the king is in the land.

281
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
If you can't take the land back in time,

282
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
who will believe that His Majesty will not kill the king

283
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
when the land is returned to the land?

284
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Chi Yi,

285
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I beg Your Majesty to think twice.

286
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
But how can you guarantee

287
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
that the 50,000 taels of silver

288
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
will be transferred to the country

289
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
when you return to the land?

290
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Now our country is the state of the king of Dan Yang.

291
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
If His Majesty returns, the brotherhood will be in power.

292
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
The country will definitely be divided by internal strife.

293
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Your Majesty, 50,000 taels of gold

294
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
is the internal strife of our country.

295
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
It's not worth it.

296
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
colonize...

297
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
I have to make the king think more.

298
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,560
But you can't let me

299
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
take the kingdom without your authority.

300
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
When we go to the prince's home,

301
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I've done my duty.

302
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
I'll leave now.

303
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Please send Prince Li out of the palace for me.

304
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Give him a banquet.

305
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
And also

306
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,600
give him a gift.

307
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,000
The Emperor of An is coming.

308
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll go with you.

309
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Go.

310
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Go.

311
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Go.

312
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Go.

313
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Go.

314
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Go.

315
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Go.

316
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Go.

317
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Go.

318
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Go.

319
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Go.

320
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Go.

321
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Go.

322
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Go.

323
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Go.

324
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Go.

325
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Go.

326
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Go.

327
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Go.

328
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Go.

329
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Go.

330
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Go.

331
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Go.

332
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,400
Go.

333
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
You.

334
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:19,380
tenderly

335
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,300
다�bout

336
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,200
Who are you?

337
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Are you Dacheng?

338
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,400
I'm the Empress Deity.

339
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,900
I'm Buddha Daochong's boy.

340
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Come there.

341
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,760
So from today on, we have to prepare for the plan to attack the rescue

342
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,000
If it fails, then the emperor and the crown prince

343
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
And believe in the good will of the enemy

344
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,440
The sword in your hand is still more reliable

345
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Yes, I love

346
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,320
The crown prince came to settle down and travel a thousand miles a day

347
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,480
Your Highness, I have something to do, I'll leave you alone

348
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,480
Your Highness

349
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:15,160
You must protect scholars

350
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,320
Bvat, poisoning

351
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,180
Cel demonstration

352
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,320
Whats the different price?

353
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
But he was hurt.

354
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
But I only know how to treat diseases.

355
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I don't know how to treat my heart.

356
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
He has been hurt many times before.

357
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
And also because of me,

358
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
he was hurt.

359
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
I'm sorry.

360
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
What should we do, Boss?

361
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Should I go outside and find more doctors?

362
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
No, it's too dangerous.

363
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Was there a ginseng soup in the temple?

364
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Yes. I'll go with you.

365
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Okay.

366
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Shisan, help me find some...

367
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Are you crazy?

368
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Listen to me. Go.

369
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Go.

370
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Wait.

371
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Nian,

372
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
are you sure?

373
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
This is ice. He can handle it.

374
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
The best way to treat people

375
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
is to use ice.

376
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
But not directly.

377
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
I have my own way.

378
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Ruyi,

379
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
wake up.

380
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Ying, Yuan Lu,

381
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
and Qian Zhao and Sun Lang,

382
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
are waiting for you.

383
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
We also agreed

384
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
to build the world together.

385
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
To make more of it together.

386
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
You promised

387
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
you would never leave me.

388
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
You promised me.

389
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Ruyi.

390
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Ruyi.

391
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Ruyi.

392
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
You're awake, Ruyi.

393
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
You're finally awake.

394
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
How did you get in?

395
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
You're so stupid.

396
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
You're not even

397
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
a good person.

398
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
You're so selfish.

399
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Why didn't you

400
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
just put me on the ice?

401
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I've said I could handle it.

402
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I can handle it.

403
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I know you want to use ice.

404
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
So I can't.

405
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
From now on,

406
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
I won't let you get hurt.

407
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Here, drink some soup.

408
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Drink it.

409
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Slowly.

410
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Here.

411
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Wipe your mouth.

412
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
How is it?

413
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Do you feel better?

414
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Jia Ling.

415
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Don't worry.

416
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
I've developed

417
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
her wishes.

418
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Thank you.

419
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
But she never got

420
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
what she wanted.

421
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Ying was in the work

422
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
to see Andy today.

423
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Andy was quiet today.

424
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
It is possible that

425
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,540
I have always been a small Federal Office employee

426
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,960
who is always in charge ofgusb

427
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,980
That is why the full female semi-fik

428
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,940
I want to ask next time

429
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,100
this time

430
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,320
will also be developed

431
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,920
Inside your heart

432
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,920
will only get to kill him in the river pond last night.

433
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,520
So that he can explain to Andie

434
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,120
and use this opportunity to eliminate Yi Qi in the Chuyi Division.

435
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,440
It's one second.

436
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,480
So,

437
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,000
Jialin's last wish

438
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
has also become a cannon.

439
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,040
In the court,

440
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,800
is it really always like this?

441
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,560
Turn the black and white?

442
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,600
This is why I always want to stay away from the court.

443
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,320
How do you think

444
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,960
Jialin's words are a pity?

445
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
I haven't told you yet.

446
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,600
These days, the court reported a secret secret.

447
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,320
Before you were killed,

448
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:31,840
Andie had asked the Northern

449
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,240
You mean

450
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,040
His Majesty actually actively colluded with the Northern

451
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,400
And Her Highness was careless

452
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,280
and colluded with His Majesty.

453
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,400
I dare not make a conclusion on this matter.

454
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,280
After all, it's just a rumor.

455
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
What if someone spread the rumor?

456
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,000
But in short,

457
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,600
she believes that you killed the queen.

458
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,560
It's too strange.

459
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,160
It seems to be trying to cover up

460
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,640
and deliberately find you to replace.

461
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,040
I will find out everything.

462
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,800
No matter who killed the queen,

463
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,000
I will not let her go.

464
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,880
This is the gift list

465
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,200
that His Highness will visit tomorrow.

466
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,320
Hurry up and prepare it.

467
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,120
Yes.

468
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm looking for you.

469
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,520
Looking for me?

470
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,680
I need someone to take it

471
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,880
to relieve my mental stress.

472
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,440
The medicine that the memory hall ordered.

473
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,800
Can you help me match it?

474
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,400
No need to match.

475
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,520
I have a limited edition.

476
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,400
This is the one in His Highness's ring.

477
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,440
After the person who took it was used,

478
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,520
most likely not remember what he was born.

479
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,920
Thank you.

480
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,160
Take care.

481
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Sister Ru Yi.

482
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,440
Aying.

483
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,440
Brother Yuan Zhou.

484
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Let her go.

485
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,880
Aren't you going to accompany her?

486
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,360
She wants to deal with the secret of the royal family.

487
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,120
It's not convenient for outsiders to participate.

488
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,080
What we have to do now

489
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
is to wait for her to come back safely.

490
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,200
But...

491
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,960
Aying.

492
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,160
Everyone has their own secrets.

493
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,160
Sometimes, don't ask too much.

494
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,760
It's also a kind of respect.

495
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,880
Brother Yuan Zhou.

496
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,320
There is one thing

497
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,240
I want to discuss with you.

498
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,680
You accompany me for a while.

499
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,120
Okay.

500
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,600
When are you going to

501
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,720
take over Yong An Tower?

502
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,720
It will take some time.

503
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,360
And this plan

504
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,680
must be very important.

505
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,560
Then will you have high hopes?

506
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,760
Not high.

507
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,160
If the attack tower fails,

508
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,640
how many people will be killed?

509
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,680
In the past, I usually prepared

510
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,360
more than half of the supply of the task

511
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,000
for the task.

512
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,080
That is to say,

513
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,680
Brother Yuan Lu, Brother 13th,

514
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,000
and Old Qian Sun Lang

515
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,560
may only come back half of it.

516
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,440
Your Highness.

517
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,720
In fact, once this thing fails,

518
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,280
you are the most dangerous person.

519
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,160
But I have discussed it with Ru Yi.

520
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,080
It's not convenient for him to participate in the attack.

521
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
At that time, he will take you to a safe place.

522
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,360
If we all...

523
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
If we all...

524
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
If we all...

525
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If we all...

526
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If we all...

527
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
If we all...

528
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
If we all...

529
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If we all...

530
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
If we all...

531
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
If we all...

532
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,000
If we all...

533
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,760
If we all...

534
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
If we all...

535
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,760
if not the right place

536
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,160
to be killed,

537
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
then what else can he do?

538
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Your Highness.

539
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,040
I made it up to towards District 15 already

540
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,080
for easy questioning and questioning.

541
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,040
At that time,

542
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
I'm here.

543
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,040
I order you to keep the six Taoist temples safe.

544
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,040
You can do other things.

545
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
I mean,

546
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
if my brother can save his uncle,

547
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
if he can't,

548
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,040
you can force him to write a letter to him.

549
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
But Xuanyuan can come back.

550
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
I can't force him to write a letter to him.

551
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
But you can.

552
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,040
My brother is a narrow-minded and selfish man.

553
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Chai Ming died for him.

554
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,040
But he treats the innocence of his brothers as a trade.

555
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
He is the king of a country.

556
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
He has to save them.

557
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
But if he can't,

558
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
it's the will of God.

559
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
I can't let you sacrifice for him.

560
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,040
I will take the responsibility if there is any consequence.

561
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
But can you afford it?

562
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,040
If the king of Dan Yang asks you for a crime,

563
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
how can you escape?

564
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
My brother can't go back to the palace.

565
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
The emperor is the king of Dan Yang.

566
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I have the credit of being a dragon.

567
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
He is not righteous.

568
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
If he really dares to do anything to me,

569
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,040
I'm afraid that dragon won't be stable.

570
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
If there is any accident,

571
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
I will take off this robe.

572
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Anyway, they want to catch the king of Li.

573
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
What does it have to do with me?

574
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
I obey your order.

575
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
I'm sorry to let you down.

576
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

577
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

578
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

579
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

580
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Ying,

581
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
you've really grown up.

582
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
You're so smart,

583
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
but you can't even be a dragon.

584
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
I'm sorry.

585
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm sorry.

586
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm sorry.

587
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
I'm sorry.

588
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
You're so smart.

589
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm sorry.

590
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
You're so smart.

591
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
You're so smart.

592
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Thank you.

593
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
I just bought pine nuts.

594
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
You don't let me die.

595
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,240
I'll go up.

596
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,280
Hold on tight.

597
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,920
Why are you crying?

598
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
Didn't Ninh Tau just praise you?

599
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,720
Nothing.

600
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,360
I just want to cry.

601
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Miss your mother?

602
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,200
How do you know?

603
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,720
I guessed it.

604
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,160
Mr. Du and my brother

605
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,480
have always said

606
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm getting better.

607
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,920
I'm really not the daughter of my father.

608
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,560
But I'm also the daughter of my mother.

609
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,040
Is it because she was born with a poor background

610
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,280
that she doesn't deserve to be praised?

611
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,680
Only Brother Yuan Zhou still thinks about her.

612
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,360
And you're the one who's more proud.

613
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,080
It's not because you're the daughter of someone else, right?

614
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,080
Come on.

615
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,800
That's right.

616
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,120
What kind of candy are you eating?

617
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,080
I always watch you eat.

618
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,200
Give me one, too.

619
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,400
This is my pill.

620
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,640
It's bitter.

621
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,040
Why are you so happy when you eat such bitter food?

622
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,720
Because I'm still alive because I can take medicine.

623
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,280
I'm happy to be alive.

624
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,880
Otherwise, why did I thank you just now?

625
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,640
Are you afraid?

626
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,640
Afraid of what?

627
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,520
Death.

628
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,880
Of course I'm afraid.

629
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,920
And I have so many fun things to play.

630
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,480
I've never experienced anything delicious.

631
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,040
Why can't I live?

632
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,680
Right?

633
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm not afraid of death.

634
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But...

635
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,840
I don't want Nian to be worried.

636
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,320
I don't know.

637
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,280
I've been here several times.

638
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,360
I've been here several times.

639
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,320
I don't want her to be sad.

640
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,720
So I pretended to be heartless.

641
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,760
Am I good?

642
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,720
Of course.

643
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,840
If I were better,

644
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,160
I wouldn't be afraid.

645
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,760
Would your death make my brother be saved?

646
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,800
Naturally, I'm gonna be afraid.

647
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,840
Still, rather than to remind myself at this time,

648
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,040
I think what dates back to the old days

649
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,480
were much smaller than what I thought.

650
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,940
You are...

651
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
I'll let you borrow it.

652
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,680
Don't worry.

653
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
I'm a short-lived ghost.

654
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm not as lucky as you.

655
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
Hurry up.

656
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,680
Why do you always say such a sad thing?

657
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,680
I'm not.

658
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Here's a song for you.

659
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Yuan Lu.

660
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
Do you have someone you like?

661
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Yes.

662
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Yuan Lu.

663
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Yuan Lu.

664
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,680
Yuan Lu.

665
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Yuan Lu.

666
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Yuan Lu.

667
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,680
Yuan Lu.

668
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
Yuan Lu.

669
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Yuan Lu.

670
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Yuan Lu.

671
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
Yuan Lu.

672
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Yuan Lu.

673
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Yuan Lu.

674
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Yuan Lu.

675
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Yuan Lu.

676
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,680
Yuan Lu.

677
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
Yuan Lu.

678
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680

679
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,680

680
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,680

681
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,680

683
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
