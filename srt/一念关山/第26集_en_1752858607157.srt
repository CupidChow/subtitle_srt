The

clouds are so beautiful

The wind blows the clouds and the clouds are hidden

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,220
The clouds are so beautiful

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,220
The wind blows the clouds and the clouds are hidden

8
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,220
The clouds are so beautiful

00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,440
The clouds are so beautiful

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,440
The clouds are so beautiful

00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,440
The clouds are so beautiful

00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,440
The clouds are so beautiful

17
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,060
For you.

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,560
Too chuckling to moi

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,140
who

20
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,220
Do you have someone you like?

21
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Yes.

22
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,220
I guess I do.

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,220
But he will never like me.

24
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,220
So I will never let him know.

25
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,220
Who will like me in the future?

26
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220
What kind of prince will I choose?

27
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,220
Of course, I will find someone who is good to you.

28
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,220
But after all these years,

29
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,220
I can still go back to Da Wu and be a normal princess.

30
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,220
As long as the prince is good to me, I will be satisfied.

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,220
If those royal family members knew that I was a girl dressed as a man and went to the country of An,

32
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,220
would they dare to marry me?

33
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
And...

34
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,220
Uncle.

35
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,220
Andy has always been ambitious.

36
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,220
If Da Wu is in danger in the future,

37
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,220
can I still be a rich woman who is old and rich?

38
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,220
Then...

39
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,220
You can be like the princess in the past.

40
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,220
You can be the princess who can take over Da Wu.

41
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,220
Why don't you go to the branch and fish for sugar?

42
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,220
Don't think about it.

43
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
What's wrong?

44
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,220
What's wrong with us sitting here and thinking about it?

45
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,220
What's wrong?

46
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,220
Anyway, it's not like there's no royal branch that has ever taken over Liudautang.

47
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,220
Anyway, after this trip, you will be back.

48
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,220
Anyway, you know Liudautang very well.

49
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,220
You can take over Liudautang as the princess.

50
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
That's a lot of strength.

51
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
Interesting.

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
Then...

53
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,220
If you were still alive at that time,

54
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
and no one dared to be my husband,

55
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
we would be together.

56
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,220
Anyway, we are all acquaintances.

57
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,220
You will have a good memory after you die.

58
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,220
Don't learn everything from Ruyi.

59
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,220
She always wants to steal the stage and wants a child.

60
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,220
No.

61
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,220
Stop thinking about it.

62
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,220
What kind of child?

63
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,220
I take one from the royal family to be the adopted son, okay?

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,220
That's not okay.

65
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,220
I just said I wanted to be your husband.

66
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
You still don't agree.

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Who doesn't agree?

68
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
It's you who doesn't agree, okay?

69
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,220
What's the hurry?

70
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,220
The cat is fighting.

71
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Cat?

72
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
Cats are gentle and cute little babies.

73
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,220
They don't fight.

74
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,220
You are lying.

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
Is it a cat?

76
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
One price, one product.

77
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
Come on.

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
Look at this one.

79
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,220
How about the one that was given to Lao Ning before?

80
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,220
How is it?

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,220
Do you think if I wear this to Yongan Temple,

82
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,220
I look like a smart scholar who has been suffering from the disease

83
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,220
for the sake of the coming year?

84
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,220
Yes.

85
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
But do you know what it looks more like?

86
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Tell me.

87
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,220
Like a child.

88
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,220
Child?

89
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
It's so troublesome.

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,220
You don't think about how many children I have.

91
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
I have a whole family.

92
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,220
Yes.

93
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,220
The child is called Jin, right?

94
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
Of course, it's Yu.

95
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Why is it called Yu?

96
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Jin.

97
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Your whole family is Jin.

98
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
I didn't want to steal your stage.

99
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Who said I wanted to steal your stage?

100
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Stop.

101
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
Okay, no problem.

102
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I'll be your...

103
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
...preparation husband.

104
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
Preparation.

105
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
No need. Who cares?

106
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,220
I'm just joking.

107
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,220
You still take it seriously?

108
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Your Highness.

109
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,220
If no one in the whole world dares to marry you,

110
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
you should keep your eyes away from it.

111
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,220
With your current vision and vision,

112
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,220
it's enough to be the queen.

113
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,220
There must be a suitable husband for you in the world.

114
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,220
There must be a suitable husband for you in the world.

115
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,220
Yuan Luo.

116
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,220
We'll be fine.

117
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
When this is over,

118
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,220
we'll go to Yuan Zhou and Ruyi's room together.

119
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,220
It's a deal.

120
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
It's a deal.

121
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,220
Come on.

122
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Thank you.

123
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
This is delicious.

124
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
Thank you.

125
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,220
Don't be angry.

126
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
Come on.

127
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,220
You can't be angry.

128
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,220
musician

129
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,220
This batch of beads are good.

130
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
These South Sea melons

131
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,220
could leave to the mother of the consort.

132
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,220
Could this be

133
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,220
You are too bold.

134
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,220
I told my father that since I lost my mother,

135
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
the mother of the noble consort is my biological mother.

136
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,220
Since I have passed the path of fame,

137
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,220
I naturally want to be honest and filial to her.

138
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,220
These years, if it weren't for her,

139
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,220
my days would be even more difficult.

140
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,220
Since these fruits are rare,

141
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,220
then how about you give some money to her?

142
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,220
How many times have I told you?

143
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Father doesn't like to visit his mother often.

144
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
She is already dead, what's the need to give me fruits?

145
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,220
Get lost!

146
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,220
Mother.

147
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,220
Actually, you might not enjoy my worship.

148
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,220
Please forgive me, okay?

149
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,220
Your Highness, Sister Huan has been waiting for you in the west.

150
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Coming.

151
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
Mother.

152
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,220
Water.

153
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
Water!

154
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Bastard!

155
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
Let's see how I will deal with you.

156
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,220
Mother.

157
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
Your Highness.

158
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
Come, come, come.

159
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Your sister doesn't want to bring flowers.

160
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,220
We will definitely bring them to her.

161
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Mother.

162
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Chi, why are you not listening?

163
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Why are you making mother angry?

164
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
Kneel down.

165
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Tell me, mother treats you so well.

166
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Why are you hurting mother?

167
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Father, please don't deprive mother.

168
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Don't worry.

169
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
I don't want to do this either.

170
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
But you have to think of a way

171
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
to let her let go of that matter.

172
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
Don't force me.

173
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,220
If I insist on kneeling down and begging for forgiveness,

174
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
I will let you be the Crown Prince.

175
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,220
Mother.

176
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,220
You and father are husband and wife.

177
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
You should treat father as your father.

178
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Don't force him and make him feel uncomfortable.

179
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,220
So, you are colluding with him for your Crown Prince position?

180
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,220
You still care about such a big thing.

181
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
I just want to buy some horses from the Northern Plains.

182
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Mother, the Northern Plains people invaded the Qing Dynasty many years ago.

183
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,220
What does it have to do with the present?

184
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,220
If you still hold father in your hands,

185
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
how can I be the Crown Prince?

186
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
No.

187
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,220
I can't forget my grandfather died in the hands of the Northern Plains.

188
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
In order to be the Crown Prince,

189
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,220
you didn't care about the people of Central Plains at all.

190
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,220
Your Highness, is this really appropriate?

191
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,220
I just got a report from the Goddess of Mercy.

192
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,220
As long as the officials believe that she is going to the Kutai Temple to be crazy,

193
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,220
I will be the Crown Prince.

194
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,220
You are a baby.

195
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,220
You are shameless and sinister.

196
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,220
You said that your mother is crazy.

197
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,220
How can you be my biological son?

198
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Then I want to be your son.

199
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,220
You don't help me be the Crown Prince.

200
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
You are a child.

201
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
I don't want to be your son.

202
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
You don't help me be the Crown Prince.

203
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,220
You always fight with father.

204
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
You are shameless.

205
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
You don't deserve to be the Crown Prince.

206
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
The water is coming.

207
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
The water is coming.

208
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Help.

209
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
The Empress is still upstairs.

210
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
Run.

211
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Mother.

212
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Mother.

213
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
It's just a chain.

214
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Master, it's really you.

215
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
I saw the precious

216
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
He Tan's hand on the hand of a corpse.

217
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
I guessed it right.

218
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
I beg you not to deny it.

219
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
Except you,

220
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
no one will go to the Empress's grave.

221
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
No one will go to avenge us.

222
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
In this world,

223
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
only you will be the one who is in cahoots.

224
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
I guessed it right.

225
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
I guessed it right.

226
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
I guessed it right.

227
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
I guessed it right.

228
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
I guessed you would come to the Second Prince one day.

229
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,220
Master,

230
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
I finally found you.

231
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
Master,

232
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
you speak.

233
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
I beg you.

234
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
I beg you to let me go.

235
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,220
I beg you to let me go.

236
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,220
I beg you.

237
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Master,

238
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
I know that you hide your identity.

239
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
You must have your own reasons.

240
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
But,

241
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
what kind of identity do you choose in the future?

242
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,220
How willing you are?

243
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
As long as you don't leave me,

244
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
just stay with me.

245
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
I just want to find a safe place

246
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
to ask you a few things.

247
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Master, please.

248
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
Why did the late Empress

249
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
give herself to the Demon-Promised Lu?

250
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
These years,

251
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
you have been with His Majesty.

252
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
You should know something.

253
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
Master,

254
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
Don't force me to be stubborn.

255
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Even if you didn't know before,

256
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
Noble Consort Chu must know.

257
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Yes.

258
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
It's because

259
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
the late Empress and His Majesty had a fight.

260
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,220
That's why I can't figure it out.

261
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
It's because

262
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
His Majesty colluded with the Northern Pan?

263
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Yes.

264
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
Back then, His Majesty wanted to

265
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
buy horses from the Northern Pan

266
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
because he wanted to buy silver from the Su State.

267
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,220
His Majesty was unable to succeed,

268
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,220
so he had to go to Tai Miao.

269
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,220
But,

270
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
the situation was not stable.

271
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,220
So,

272
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,220
he tried to seduce the late Empress

273
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
and block the news.

274
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
He hid the truth from the officials.

275
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,220
He wanted to get rid of the late Empress.

276
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Isn't he afraid that the Shadong Tribe will be dissatisfied?

277
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
The old Duke Cui has been angry

278
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
for three thousand times.

279
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,220
If the Shadong Tribe still makes trouble,

280
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,220
he will save the late Empress and her two younger brothers

281
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
and take the death penalty of killing the Central Depot.

282
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Take the death penalty?

283
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Who framed you?

284
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,220
I didn't find out.

285
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
Anyway,

286
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
His Majesty was angry.

287
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,220
He was provoked by the late Emperor

288
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
and wanted to kill Her Highness to cover up the Northern Pan.

289
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
He was afraid that you would come to save him.

290
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,220
Fortunately, he left you and then took action.

291
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
He pretended to be a fire.

292
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
At that time,

293
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Her Highness suddenly found out

294
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,220
that the late Emperor and the Shadong Tribe

295
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
were all against the late Empress.

296
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
That's why she was so angry.

297
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,220
So...

298
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
So...

299
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
In order to cover up the scandal,

300
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
a Crown Prince's plan

301
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,220
and three thousand Qinong

302
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,220
were sold together

303
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
by Her Highness's husband, son, and father.

304
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,220
What Her Highness cares about most

305
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
is not just the late Empress.

306
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,220
It's not just the late Empress.

307
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,220
It's the betrayal of her loved ones.

308
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
No wonder how I saved her.

309
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
She didn't want to escape at all.

310
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
It's not sadness.

311
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
It's not shame.

312
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
It's despair.

313
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Yes.

314
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
I know.

315
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,220
I'm leaving.

316
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
Master.

317
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Master, don't go.

318
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Don't leave me again.

319
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,220
I'm not the one who left you.

320
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
It's yourself.

321
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Master, don't!

322
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Master!

323
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Master, listen to me.

324
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
I...

325
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Meiniang was right.

326
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
You did make such a mistake.

327
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Kneel!

328
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Look at me.

329
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,220
I'm standing in front of you.

330
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
I'll give you a chance to explain

331
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
what you're thinking about me.

332
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Master!

333
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
Master!

334
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
Don't go.

335
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,220
Renxin.

336
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,220
I like you.

337
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
No, I love you.

338
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
My feelings for you

339
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,220
are the feelings of a man to a woman.

340
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
As long as you're with me,

341
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
I can do anything.

342
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Even if it means to the heaven and earth.

343
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Okay.

344
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,220
Then you'll give me your resignation letter.

345
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Give me the Yuling Army in your hands.

346
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,220
Give up your proudest state.

347
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
And pick a few handsome men

348
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,220
to serve you.

349
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
What?

350
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,220
Can't you do it?

351
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Okay.

352
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
But as long as you promise me,

353
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,220
I won't leave you.

354
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
Chang Qinghou.

355
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
You're not a child anymore.

356
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Don't make a wish you can't make.

357
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
You were young.

358
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,220
Maybe you have a feeling for me.

359
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
But it's just a sweet thing

360
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
that you can't get your mother to do.

361
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,220
Now you're grown up.

362
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Your goal

363
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
is not to have a life

364
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
that is not laughed at.

365
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
You want to be the leader.

366
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
You want to be the most powerful person.

367
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
You can't have soft tears

368
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
or a life.

369
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
You can't have a life.

370
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
You're dead.

371
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Princess Hu Yang

372
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
is a fake.

373
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
No.

374
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,220
You forgot it all.

375
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
No.

376
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
It's me.

377
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
It's me.

378
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
Do you want me to make it clearer?

379
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
No one in the world

380
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,220
understands what the late empress

381
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
is.

382
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
But all these years,

383
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,220
you never wanted to avenge her.

384
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
You never even worshiped her.

385
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
You forgot who took you

386
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
to the palace when your mother

387
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
abandoned you.

388
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Li Tongguang.

389
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
No.

390
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,220
Do you know why I said

391
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,220
you lost Jiu'er?

392
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Because no matter how

393
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,220
tired and confused Jiu'er was,

394
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
she wouldn't be so cold.

395
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,220
Master.

396
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
I'm Ru Yi now.

397
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
I'll avenge her myself.

398
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
Then I'll leave Andu.

399
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
After all, we're lost.

400
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
From now on,

401
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
we'll be fine.

402
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,220
Master.

403
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,220
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,220
But can you really

405
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,220
stop?

406
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,220
I'm your only disciple.

407
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Forget the past.

408
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
I'm not your disciple now.

409
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
It's her.

410
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,220
It's that King of Li, right?

411
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,220
It's none of your business.

412
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,220
Stay here.

413
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Don't come after me.

414
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,220
Do you understand?

415
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Master.

416
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
Master.

417
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
Master.

418
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
Master.

419
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Master.

420
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Master.

421
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
It's 3 o'clock.

422
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
You're still awake?

423
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
I've been waiting for you.

424
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
I've prepared a night snack for you.

425
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
Chicken soup wonton.

426
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
When I heard you were going into the yard,

427
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
I cooked it.

428
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
It's perfect to eat now.

429
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
And this.

430
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
I cooked this for you.

431
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
It's not Zhang Ji's,

432
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
but it tastes good.

433
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
Here.

434
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
Why are you

435
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,220
back so late?

436
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
What's wrong?

437
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,220
I won't ask.

438
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,220
You have your own reason

439
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,220
for doing things.

440
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
If you don't want to say it,

441
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
I won't ask.

442
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Eat.

443
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
From now on,

444
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
I'll cook at home.

445
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
You have to get used to this life.

446
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,220
How is it?

447
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,220
You eat too.

448
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
I'm good at cooking.

449
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
Eat more.

450
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
I'm full.

451
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
I'll take you to a place tomorrow.

452
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
The secret of Andu's share is...

453
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
I'll take you to the place tomorrow.

454
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,220
You've been here for eight years.

455
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,220
That's five years ago when the Empress passed away.

456
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
I've prepared all the information.

457
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
It's all here.

458
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
I want to read the report

459
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
of the Sand Dunes and the Sand Plains of the East Sand.

460
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Okay.

461
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,220
This report

462
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,220
was submitted by

463
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
the Grand Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel, Tao Wei.

464
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,220
Tao Wei?

465
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
Yes.

466
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,220
The Empress was unruly,

467
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,220
disloyal to the King,

468
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,220
disloyal to her position,

469
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
and disloyal to her position.

470
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
I'm sorry.

471
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
I'm sorry.

472
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
I'm sorry.

473
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
I've also helped you

474
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
to organize a relationship map.

475
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
This Tao Wei

476
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
is closely related to the Grand Prince's father-in-law, Wang Guohong.

477
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,220
Five years ago,

478
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
the Grand Prince had just made a marriage contract with Wang's only daughter.

479
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
If the Empress was deposed,

480
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
the Second Prince would no longer be the legitimate son.

481
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
The second Prince would have the opportunity to ask the Emperor.

482
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
So he joined his own music

483
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
and instructed Tao Wei

484
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
to question the Grand Secretary.

485
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
Let's go.

486
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Okay.

487
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
Are you okay?

488
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Li Tung's second son...

489
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,220
Actually, I already know most of the truth.

490
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Last night,

491
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
I went to the Changqing Mansion

492
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
and asked about some things.

493
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Oh, right.

494
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Li Tunguang already knows my identity.

495
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
You're right.

496
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Actually, these past few years,

497
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
I've not thought about the real reason

498
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
for Her Highness's death.

499
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
It's just that every time,

500
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,220
I didn't dare to think about it.

501
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
These past few years,

502
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,220
she has always been very proud of herself.

503
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
She often writes about her past and misses Her Highness.

504
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
I really can't believe

505
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,220
that unreadable truth.

506
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,220
I understand.

507
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
In your heart,

508
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Her Highness is a perfect person.

509
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
She deserves all the beauty in the world.

510
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
You just don't believe her

511
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,220
and entrust her to someone else.

512
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
You don't think that she would betray her husband.

513
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
Oh, right.

514
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
Is Her Highness's death

515
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,220
related to Noble Consort Chu?

516
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,220
It shouldn't be related to her.

517
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
Noble Consort Chu was in the country three years ago.

518
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,220
She also wanted to marry

519
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
a princess from another country as her heir.

520
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,220
But she has been too aggressive these years.

521
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,220
No one is willing to marry her.

522
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,220
She also said that

523
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
she would never betray Her Highness.

524
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
She would never betray her future.

525
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
She and Her Highness are young couple

526
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
with deep love.

527
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,220
If Her Highness didn't do her best to support her,

528
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,220
she would never be the Crown Prince

529
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
as the Crown Prince of the Imperial House.

530
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
I finally understand

531
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
why Her Highness wouldn't run away with me.

532
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Because she was desperate.

533
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,220
Because she didn't want to drag me down.

534
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,220
After all,

535
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
it was her husband who ordered her to do it.

536
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
It was her son who betrayed her.

537
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
She could only let me

538
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
leave the country to escape.

539
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
But I didn't listen to her.

540
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
No wonder the Court of Judicial Review

541
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,220
has decided so quickly

542
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
that I am the murderer of Her Highness.

543
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
No wonder she beat me up

544
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
and never listened to me.

545
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
It turns out

546
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
that she was wronged.

547
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
Let's go.

548
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Your Highness,

549
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,220
I am back.

550
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,220
Ning,

551
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Ru Yi, you are back.

552
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
Thank you.

553
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
Let's go.

554
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
Why didn't you

555
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,220
kill the second prince?

556
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
He is the last blood of Her Highness.

557
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,220
I can't kill him.

558
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Her Highness's father Cui Lao

559
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,220
has been dead for two years.

560
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
He was eight years old.

561
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
The second prince was only 14 or 15 years old.

562
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
A young man

563
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
is easy to be captured by his biological father.

564
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
But the eldest prince

565
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
was 19 years old.

566
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
And his father-in-law,

567
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
Duke Wang,

568
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
I won't let them off.

569
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
What about the murderer?

570
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
You know

571
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
who I am talking about.

572
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
That's right.

573
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
I just want to think

574
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
what I should do.

575
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,220
What should I do?

576
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
This is the third one.

577
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
The Ministry of Works,

578
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
silver, don't say you are wrong.

579
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
Don't worry, I remember.

580
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
These days,

581
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,220
I will visit all the ministers

582
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
who have power.

583
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Please tell them

584
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,220
to release the emperor.

585
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,220
If you succeed,

586
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
you don't have to

587
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
leave blood on the palace.

588
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,220
Please

589
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
meet the emperor

590
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
in person.

591
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
Please.

592
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
41, 42,

593
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
43, 44,

594
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
45.

595
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
52,

596
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
53, 44,

597
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
52,

598
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
53, 44,

599
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
55, 56,

600
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
57, 58,

601
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
59, 60,

602
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
61, 61,

603
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
62, 63,

604
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
62, 63,

605
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
65, 66,

606
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
67, 68,

607
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
67, 70,

608
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
71.

609
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Ning,

610
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
I will make a wish to Buddha.

611
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
When you are one year old,

612
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
you can still live.

613
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
I already have you.

614
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
What do I need to live?

615
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
We have measured the distance.

616
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
The guards outside the Yongan Tower

617
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
should be experts.

618
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
So we have to arrange four people.

619
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
Okay.

620
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Did you find out

621
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
that there are more

622
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
guards around the temple?

623
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
They died in the left and right rooms.

624
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
It's not easy to explain

625
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
to Andie.

626
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
So now he won't allow

627
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
any more accidents.

628
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
If we can't do it,

629
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
we will have to come to the fifth room.

630
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
He will definitely think about it.

631
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
We can't let them be idle.

632
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
How about I arrange

633
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
for them to get busy?

634
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
No need.

635
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,780
The brothers of the Hall of

636
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,220
Peace have already started to do this.

637
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,220
I believe that in a few days,

638
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,220
there will be a statement.

639
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,220
It will explain the death of the left and right

640
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,220
and the details of the collusion

641
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
with the North.

642
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
When the time comes,

643
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
we will make some good things for him.

644
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
Even if he is Andie's close friend,

645
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
he is not worth it.

646
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,220
That's it.

647
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
I love you the most.

648
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
You are so mean.

649
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,220
But I love beautiful women more.

650
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,220
What?

651
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
In two days,

652
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,220
one is left and one is right.

653
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
You should be glad that you didn't let

654
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
you know her earlier.

655
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,220
Let's get down to business.

656
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,220
We have to think about the way out in advance

657
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
to ensure the safety of the plan.

658
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,220
I have three ideas.

659
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,220
First,

660
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
go the mountain road.

661
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
Yes.

662
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,220
Your Majesty.

663
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Where are you?

664
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,220
Your Highness.

665
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
Your Highness.

666
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,220
I've told you many times.

667
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
I like to be an assassin.

668
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,220
To kill those evil people for you and His Majesty.

669
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,220
But His Majesty betrayed you and the people of Central Plains.

670
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,220
So I want to kill him.

671
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
But I'm afraid that death will make him feel better.

672
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,220
I also want to tell the truth to the world.

673
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
And forget the future.

674
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,220
Do you think it's okay?

675
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,220
Ruyi.

676
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
Ruyi.

677
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,220
Ruyi.

678
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
Ruyi.

679
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
This is the first time you call me Ruyi.

680
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,220
I understand.

681
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Three miles from the Central Plains.

682
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,220
The heat of the camp is indeed increasing.

683
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Where is His Highness?

684
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Is he back?

685
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,220
We've been waiting at the gate.

686
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
Ningtou and Brother Yu are not back.

687
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I'm not worried about Ningtou.

688
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,220
I'm worried about His Highness.

689
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
After all, it's their first time to separate.

690
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,220
And that Chang Qinghou.

691
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,220
I heard that when he was in the palace, he was not good to His Highness.

692
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Yes.

693
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,220
We still have to strengthen the defense.

694
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,220
It's that Prince Li, right?

695
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,220
Go.

696
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
Your Highness.

697
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,220
Get out.

698
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Or I'll kill you.

699
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,220
No.

700
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,220
You almost ruined my Golden Beauty's face.

701
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
I can only kill you.

702
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
No.

703
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,220
No.

704
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,220
Cao.

705
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,220
The move you used just now is called the jade stone powder.

706
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,220
Is it your master's swordplay?

707
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
In the situation where you can't escape when killing people,

708
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
you are in a close game with your opponent.

709
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,220
Li Tengguang.

710
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,220
Tell me why you did that.

711
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,220
If I were to enter the camp,

712
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,220
my master would come to me.

713
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,220
No matter how sad or angry he is,

714
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,220
it's good that he really killed me.

715
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,220
I just hope he will ignore me.

716
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,220
I just hope he won't torture me like this.

717
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,220
I'm telling you.

718
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,220
It doesn't matter if you die or not.

719
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,220
But the person you want to kill is my brother.

720
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,220
Just because your master ignores you,

721
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,220
you don't want to hurt others.

722
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,220
I thought you were a scoundrel before.

723
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,220
That's why I was so proud of you.

724
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,220
Have you ever thought about it?

725
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,220
If you do this,

726
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,220
if you hurt His Highness,

727
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,220
what kind of disaster will happen to the peace of the two countries?

728
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,220
I can't bear so much.

729
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
I just want to ask my master.

730
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,220
I just want to ask my master!

731
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,220
Master!

732
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,220
Master!

733
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:29,220
How many years have passed since then?

734
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:37,220
I have no one to spend my life with.
