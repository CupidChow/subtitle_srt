1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,160
We lost our way together

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,080
We are still together

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,000
The past days are still like a dream

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,120
When the time comes, we will exchange our hands

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,560
How are you?

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,920
The Long Ballad

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280
Why don't you come with me?

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
You are still waiting for me to save the hero

9
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,880
How can he miss me?

10
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,240
Don't worry

11
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
I will be back soon

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,360
Seer

13
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,760
He's alright

14
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,520
Don't worry

15
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,720
Thank you

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:07,340
And get hurt x2

17
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,400
Da'er

18
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,240
Not outside

19
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,300
There are 600 people who already Chicago

20
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,620
They were hited to death by the armed force

21
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
I don't blame you for this

22
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Don't think about it

23
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Take care of yourself

24
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Take him away

25
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Hold on

26
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Hold on

27
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
It will be over soon

28
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Hold on

29
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Hold on

30
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Hold on

31
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Hold on

32
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Hold on

33
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Hold on

34
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Hold on

35
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Hold on

36
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Hold on

37
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Hold on

38
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Hold on

39
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Dongzi

40
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
The soup is ready

41
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Get up and drink

42
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
The soup is so delicious

43
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Dongzi, wake up

44
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Get up and drink

45
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Dongzi

46
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Dongzi

47
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
The young people have left

48
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Only the two of us are left

49
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
When you leave, remember to tell me

50
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Tell me

51
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Do you know what I've cheated on you with?

52
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
What the hell

53
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm 13

54
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm going to drink the most fierce wine in my life

55
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Look at the most beautiful girl

56
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Look for the best friend

57
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Look for the most cheerful husband

58
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Let's go, Lin Bo

59
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I agree

60
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Lin Bo

61
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Lin Bo

62
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Lin Bo

63
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Lin Bo

64
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Wait

65
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Chase her

66
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Chase her

67
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
13, keep up

68
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm afraid the blood is like water

69
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
No matter how beautiful it is

70
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
You are so good

71
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
The rain in the night

72
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
I can't retreat

73
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Dare not ask this time

74
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,240
The farewell that is still flying

75
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Is it our real ending?

76
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,240
I'm afraid the dream is too beautiful

77
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,240
I'm afraid I'll regret it

78
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm afraid I'll regret it

79
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm afraid I'll regret it

80
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
I'm afraid I'll regret it

81
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm afraid I'll regret it

82
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm afraid I'll regret it

83
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm afraid I'll regret it

84
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm afraid that I'll regret it

85
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm afraid I'll get drunk again

86
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,240
The song of the old dream never came back

87
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm afraid that I'll get drunk again

88
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
like a drunkard in a dream

89
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm afraid I'll get drunk again

90
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
You're here

91
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I miss Shisan

92
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
This Yu Shisan

93
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,040
He lied to me countless times.

94
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,840
But this time, he told me

95
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,640
he was leaving.

96
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
He really left.

97
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
Ying has been crying with Chu Yue for a long time.

98
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,160
He said

99
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,960
Yu Shi San has fulfilled his wish.

100
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
He should be very happy.

101
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,760
Ruo Yan.

102
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
From now on,

103
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
you have to promise me.

104
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,400
Okay.

105
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,240
I haven't said what you have to promise me.

106
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,160
I know.

107
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,400
I won't die.

108
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,240
Don't get hurt.

109
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,480
Okay.

110
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,380
予予

111
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
Brother Yanzhou.

112
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,800
Sister Ru Yi.

113
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,000
Sister Wuyi, wake up!

114
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Brother Yuan Zhong!

115
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,720
What's wrong?

116
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh no!

117
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
Li Tongkong left a letter.

118
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,360
He sent a letter to some sect

119
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
and left the city at midnight.

120
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
He said he was going to assassinate the chief of the Northern Sect.

121
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,320
Master,

122
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
I can't bring good soldiers.

123
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,680
I lost my life

124
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,640
and lost my family.

125
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,560
Brother Yu and Brother Deng

126
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
are all dead.

127
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,560
All generals, stand up!

128
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,520
Divide the army into two groups

129
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,680
and report to the rear.

130
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,960
I want all three of them to be killed!

131
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,840
Sun Bin is a general.

132
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
The chief is incompetent.

133
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,520
Jiu'er can't be the hero you want.

134
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,480
I can only try to assassinate the chief of the Northern Sect.

135
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,840
If I succeed,

136
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,800
there will be a chance for He Xian.

137
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,880
If I fail,

138
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,800
I can die bravely

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,120
like you said

140
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,680
and seek the country with my life.

141
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,360
I can't drag the Western Battalion down.

142
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,520
I'll leave He Xian to you.

143
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,000
Jiu'er.

144
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
This fool.

145
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,680
How long has he been gone?

146
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,960
I don't know.

147
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,520
But he was still here

148
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,240
when I woke up at midnight.

149
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,800
Brother Yang, guard the city.

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
I'll go to find Duke Qin.

151
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,760
Yes.

152
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,480
Jiu'er is there.

153
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,880
I'll save her.

154
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,800
No.

155
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,120
You're more badly injured than me.

156
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,080
I'll bring her back.

157
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
I'm her master.

158
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,240
It's because you're her master.

159
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
So I'll bring her back.

160
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Ru Yi.

161
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
I'll protect you.

162
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,840
I'll protect you.

163
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
I'll protect you.

164
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
I'll protect you.

165
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
I'll protect you.

166
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
I'll protect you.

167
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I'll protect you.

168
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I'll protect you.

169
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,840
Trust me.

170
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,040
You'll be injured.

171
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,120
I'll go.

172
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
You'll listen to me.

173
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
Remember what we said.

174
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,840
We'll never forget it.

175
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,120
Sha Qi Wang.

176
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
I'll leave the city guard to you and Ru Yi.

177
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I'm the Chou.

178
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,160
I'll do everything for rotating the city for the hands ofussafore warty W gotten by zd Trading Company.

179
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
Go.

180
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,560
—스� prend���Choose to die!—, I will successes when you die!

181
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,300

—, careful.

183
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,600
You killed Rong Yu.

184
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,040
Who can be punished for keeping her?

185
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,920
Hongguo.

186
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,520
Do I have to watch

187
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,920
Deng Fei die because of me?

188
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,400
Can't I do anything?

189
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,320
Come back!

190
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
Listen to me.

191
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,560
If you do something now,

192
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,680
in less than an hour,

193
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,960
the news of Dahan Qing being betrayed

194
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,720
will spread all over the world.

195
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,200
Then the country will be in chaos.

196
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,680
The court will be in chaos.

197
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
These are the results you want,

198
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,840
Li Tongguo.

199
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,440
Fire!

200
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,160
Attack them with full force!

201
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
Take them down!

202
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
Fire!

203
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,520
I know you feel guilty.

204
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,720
But now is not the time to be impulsive.

205
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
It's me.

206
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,400
Listen to me.

207
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,200
Now is not the time to apologize and die.

208
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,920
You have to take the responsibility.

209
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,080
You have to take responsibility.

210
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,040
You have to take the responsibility for failure.

211
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,400
Take the responsibility for losing your partner.

212
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,480
So you are doing this

213
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,480
because you have to take the responsibility.

214
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,880
Do you understand?

215
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,680
Okay.

216
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,720
Now,

217
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,520
we go back together.

218
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,640
We go back alive.

219
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,960
Okay.

220
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,200
Go.

221
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,040
Go.

222
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,040
I told you to follow me.

223
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
When did you become so obedient?

224
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
I can't let master down anymore.

225
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,320
I can't let you down either.

226
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,920
You have the guts.

227
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,840
I taught you so much.

228
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,880
You should give me a lesson.

229
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,600
Commander, Ning, Brother Ning.

230
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,280
Is that enough?

231
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,320
Why is it so bad?

232
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,560
Not enough. Give me another laugh.

233
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,760
I know you are selfish.

234
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
See your bus?

235
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,080
We will run there later.

236
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,400
Then follow the bus

237
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,360
and climb the wall.

238
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,160
Okay.

239
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,920
We run together.

240
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,360
You run first. I will cover you.

241
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
No.

242
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,760
You can't be a traitor for me.

243
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,800
What are you thinking about?

244
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,880
I would rather be a traitor.

245
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,600
In this world,

246
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,400
except your master,

247
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
no one can hurt me.

248
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,760
No.

249
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,600
Listen to me.

250
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,520
Go.

251
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
Listen to me.

252
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,520
I promised you something before I entered the city.

253
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,120
After we go back,

254
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,680
don't act rashly.

255
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,600
Only when you calm down,

256
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,200
we will have a chance

257
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
to bring back

258
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,920
my people.

259
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:29,280
Tong

260
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,080
I made a vow.

261
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,480
Light comes from the fire

262
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,000
Gun ö coding

263
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,420
You have never lost such a pronounce debicias at all.

264
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,540
You don't have to default.

265
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,960
Okay, guess that time thing is useless.

266
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,700
Hurry up!

267
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,080
Get down!

268
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,380
Search that compartment and you'll find Emperor Dluer.

269
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,200
Let's go.

270
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,960
Yuexuan.

271
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,200
Get up.

272
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,560
You can't leave.

273
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,920
Get up.

274
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,360
Yuexuan.

275
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Pull him up.

276
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,040
Go.

277
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,920
Hurry.

278
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320

Turns both five flowers into phenomena

281
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,520
I'm sorry

282
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,920
I was wrong

I'm afraid I can't get what I want

310
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm going crazy

311
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

312
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

313
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:42,120
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

314
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:50,320
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

315
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:58,320
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

316
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

317
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

318
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

319
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:33,520
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

320
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,920
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

321
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

322
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Wind and sand

323
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,120
I'm willing to climb mountains and climb mountains

324
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,120
I will not fall with my heart

325
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Look at the bright end of the sky

326
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,120
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

327
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Wind and sand

328
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm willing to face the hardships and dangers

329
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,120
I have lost and I can't forget

330
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm still willing to make a choice

331
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I'm willing to play

332
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,120
When I arrive, I will suddenly say hello

333
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
You are right

334
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Although we are out this time

335
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,120
But the north coast will be back soon

336
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Master, I'm sorry

337
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
You are not wrong

338
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
In fact, I have long wanted to assassinate the north coast chief

339
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Just didn't wait for the right time

340
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
The only thing you did wrong

341
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
I just want to make my own effort

342
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,120
You forgot that I am the best assassin in the country

343
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Master

344
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Sister Ruyi

345
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
We can't wait

346
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,320
When the sun rises, the North

347
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,120
When the sun rises, the North

348
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
When the sun rises, the North

349
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,120
The North will bring a new thunderbolt to attack the city

350
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Li Tongguang

351
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
You told me before

352
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,120
I wish to be with you

353
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
As the chief of the Anguo government

354
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Can you do it in one word

355
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Go

356
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Then you give me the national treasure of the Anguo

357
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
it is good

358
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
There are national treasures and this

359
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Enough

360
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Sister Ruyi can't

361
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
You can't think about it

362
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Not just to finish

363
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Things that have not been completed in the distance

364
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
How can it be called unable to think about it?

365
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Unable to think about it

366
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
You see

367
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
It's snowing again

368
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,280
The Empress Dowager and the new emperor of our Great An

369
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,000
were kidnapped by Duke Qing's Li Tongguang.

370
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,520
The city is about to break.

371
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,480
The Empress Dowager doesn't want to die.

372
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,640
But she is more afraid that Duke Qing will force her to govern.

373
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,040
The Empress Dowager allowed me to have 50 taels of gold

374
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,840
and secretly sent me out of the city.

375
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,040
I'm afraid that I will be forced to die.

376
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
I'm afraid that I will be forced to die.

377
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,560
I'm afraid that I will be forced to die.

378
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,960
I'm afraid that I will be forced to die.

379
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,640
I'm afraid that I will be forced to die.

380
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,000
I just want to beg the King

381
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,480
to spare their mother and son.

382
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
Oh, right.

383
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,280
The Empress Dowager has the jade seal of the State of An.

384
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,280
Really?

385
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,480
Okay.

386
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,400
This is the jade seal of the State of An.

387
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,880
The Empress Dowager said that this is the evidence

388
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
to show her sincerity.

389
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,760
Our Empress Dowager is only over 20 years old.

390
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,000
She is a beautiful woman who is the most beautiful in the whole of Qing.

391
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
The Empress Dowager knows that after she is born,

392
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
she will be the queen.

393
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,240
But the Empress Dowager doesn't want to be with an old man like you.

394
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,320
As long as the King is willing to marry her as his wife,

395
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,680
the Empress Dowager said that she is willing to give her the state's wedding.

396
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,160
And she will protect her mother's clan

397
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,560
and kill the West Department.

398
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,160
Good.

399
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,960
Good.

400
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,160
It's time to change the clothes.

401
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,560
I will personally escort the Empress Dowager out of the city.

402
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
To avoid attracting the Master's attention,

403
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,960
I would like to borrow some of the clothes of the Northern Plains.

404
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
It will be convenient.

405
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,360
Fortunately, there are many talented and talented people in the city.

406
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,160
Although the time has changed a bit,

407
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,760
we finally made it.

408
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,560
It's fine.

409
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,360
It's enough to fool the people of the Northern Plains.

410
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,160
A-Yin,

411
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,960
give me the gift that Yuan Luo gave you.

412
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,160
Thank you.

413
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,160
Sister Ru Yi, can you...

414
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,160
The Northern Plains people are known for being wolf-like.

415
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,760
But the young dukes of the wolf's clan

416
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,360
will always challenge the romance.

417
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
The river is never broken.

418
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,960
The chief of the Northern Plains and the father of the new left lord

419
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,160
have long been in a relationship.

420
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
If I can seize this opportunity

421
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,960
and achieve success,

422
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,360
the Northern Plains army will surely return to the Great Wolf.

423
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,160
No matter when the Yuan army of the Wu State comes,

424
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,560
you all have a chance to survive.

425
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,360
Do not worry.

426
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,560
You two...

427
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
a member of the Prime Minister purpose,

428
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,160
a member of the new left lord...

429
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,960
both are must be taken care of.

430
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Brother Yuanzhou said that you are the most powerful man in the world.

431
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
But not you.

432
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

433
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I have never failed.

434
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

435
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

436
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

437
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

438
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

439
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

440
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

441
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

442
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

443
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

444
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

445
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

446
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,960
I am the most powerful man in the world.

447
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Who is the man?

448
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I already understand.

449
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
You understand my whole body.

450
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,960
But I still have a photographer.

451
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
What do you say?

452
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Little red.

453
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Done.

454
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,920
I am the soils in front of the Chief of Dan family.

455
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,000
Only滿不 lynch,

456
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,480

You're an assassin?

510
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,200
Yes.

511
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,720
I want to kill more than her.

512
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,520
How am I an assassin?

513
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,760
You're good,

00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,760
but what about you?

515
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,480

so kill meあれ.

517
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,400

I know, but you're not alone now.

What is the heart to be with?

525
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I have no one to share my life with.

526
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I've been waiting for you.

527
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000

You're not here.

Uncle Ding just gave me this horse.

566
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,220
He's not so obedient.

00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,220
Your mother,

573
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,220
wouldn't trust someone?

574
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,020
How do you know that?

575
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,820
I have a younger sister.

576
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,220
Her name is Ren Lu.

577
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,020
She's my mother's surname.

00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,220
Your sister must be very pretty.

579
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,620
She's not as pretty as me.

580
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,420
But she has a big temper.

581
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,220
She always bullies me.

00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
My second brother adores her the most.

No problem.

00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,820
Welcome.

588
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,020
My house is in the library a few miles away.

589
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,420
Aunt, do you like drinking?

590
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,220
Do you know how to dance?

Good child, we'll definitely chat.

596
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,320
How many times have you left?

602
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,620
My heart is restless

603
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,620
I'm stubborn

604
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,620
Why are you crying?

00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,620

A year of spring and autumn

609
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,620
The wind blows here

610
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,620
The grass is soaring

611
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,620
Love is the most luxurious

612
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,620
It's the most beautiful scenery

613
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:33,620

Thank you all for coming

622
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,620
I have no regrets.

623
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,620
I was once a soldier,

624
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,620
but I'm no longer a soldier.

625
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,620
I was once a soldier,

626
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,620
but I'm no longer a soldier.

but I'm no longer a soldier.

I was once a soldier,

632
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,620
Who drinks a cup of fengshui,

633
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,620
and the blood turns into ashes?

634
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,620
Who wants to be separated for a lifetime,

635
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,620
and the sky and earth scatter like flowing water?

636
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,620
Looking back, the past is so beautiful.

637
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,620
The world is so vast,

638
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,620
but the past is so cold.

639
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,620
Who will stay for the rest of their lives,

640
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,620
and drink with me?

641
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,620
Who is drunk and worried,

642
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,620
and the heart is fearless?

643
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,620
Who is looking forward to a dream,

644
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,620
and only comes back for the wind and rain?

645
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,620
The world is so vast,

646
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,620
but the past is so cold.

647
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,620

650
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:14,620
and the sky and earth scatter like flowing water?

651
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,620
Who is looking forward to a dream,

652
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,620
and the heart is fearless?

Who is looking forward to a dream,

654
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:29,620
