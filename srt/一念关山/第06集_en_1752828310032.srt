having

a

Children's Special.

Mom's Comfort.

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
We invite you to watch

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
One Thoughts of Mount Guan.

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Episode 2

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Wake up.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Wake up. Wake up.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Brother.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Wake up. Wake up.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Yuan Luo.

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Wake up. Wake up.

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Old Yu. Old Yu.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Little lady. Little lady.

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Sir Du. Sir Du.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Sir Du.

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
There's no water left.

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
No water left.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Sir Du.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Sir Du.

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Slowly. Slowly.

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Brother Lang.

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Who? Who poisoned you?

60
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
His Highness. His Highness is here.

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
He's not dead yet.

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Don't worry.

63
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
When can you get the antidote?

64
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
It's not suitable to talk about this in front of him.

65
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm afraid you're even more unwilling to talk about it outside.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
What are you doing?

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't worry.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
It's just a sleeping incense.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Can we talk now?

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
What you said just now

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
is a very important thing.

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm afraid you can't talk about it.

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm afraid you can't talk about it.

74
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
You're quite reasonable.

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You're indeed very simple in other aspects

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
besides assassination.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I've returned what I promised you just now.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Nie Wenzhou.

80
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
You want to turn against me?

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
You don't have the inner force now.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
You can't defeat me.

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Really?

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
You...

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
No one can stand the pain of a heart-to-heart fight.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
If you beg me, I'll forgive you.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Qian Zhao, Qian Zhao.

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
You actually took advantage of the fact that I agreed to fight.

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
You're so useless.

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
You can't have the next time.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Or the brothers won't be able to do it.

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Why don't you want to give birth to a child with me?

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Tell me.

94
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Let go of me.

95
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll go and have a look.

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Why don't you want to give birth to a child with me?

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
You promised me.

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Let go of me.

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Come and help me.

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
You're dead.

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Can this help?

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Get lost.

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Let her go.

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Let me do it.

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
You can escape for a while.

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You can't escape for a lifetime.

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
As long as the heart-to-heart fight is still in your body,

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
I can make you beg for life and death at any time.

110
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Are you sure?

111
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
You're not the only one who has been to the Five Spiritual Mountains.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
You need to pour some more wine to kill it.

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Excuse me.

114
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Is it a man?

115
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
It has nothing to do with him.

116
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I taught him.

117
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,600
There were two young ladies before.

118
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
They always clung to me and didn't let go.

119
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
You know.

120
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
All right.

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Let go.

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Don't worry.

123
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Miss Ruyi is smarter than you.

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
She knows that it's no longer necessary to keep going.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
She won't be able to get angry without a reason.

126
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
You'll regret it.

127
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Which one did you play?

128
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
You don't trust me?

129
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
The air is very tight.

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Didn't you hear it outside?

131
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
She thinks I'm smart.

132
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
She just wants to use something with me.

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Okay.

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I'm not afraid of you.

135
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm not afraid of you.

136
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm not afraid of you.

137
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm not afraid of you.

138
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm not afraid of you.

139
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm not afraid of you.

140
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
And you don't want to.

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Are you that person?

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
She...

143
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
She's your child's mother.

144
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Tao.

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't worry.

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
His Highness was just a little scared.

147
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
You've had a hard day.

148
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
We won't be in a hurry to set off tomorrow.

149
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
We'll have another day to rest.

150
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Go back and rest.

151
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Yes.

152
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Tao.

153
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
He really poisoned His Highness.

154
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Why did he do that?

155
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
His Highness doesn't want to come back alive.

156
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Sir Du.

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
A single big thing will make it hard.

158
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
It's too smooth.

159
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
It's hard to prove.

160
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Don't worry.

161
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
You've had a hard day.

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Go back and rest.

163
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Give Sir Du a sedative.

165
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Okay.

166
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Sir Du.

167
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Let's go.

168
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Tao.

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
His Highness really doesn't want to go to the country of An.

170
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
He's just a little scared.

171
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
But when you gave me a mission for the first time,

172
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
you were scared, right?

173
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
But this reminded me

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
that the delegation and the business team were too hasty.

175
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I haven't given you a mission for a long time.

176
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm sure you'll be relieved.

177
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
How about this?

178
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
From today on,

179
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
every two hours,

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
we'll have two people to inspect

181
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
and we won't be eating with you.

182
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Yes.

183
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes.

184
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Yes.

185
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
We won't be eating with you.

186
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Yes.

187
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Go to bed early.

188
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
What happened to the King's body?

189
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't ask such a silly question.

190
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
No.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Have you ever seen such a big kid?

192
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
No.

193
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Ni Yuanzhou,

194
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
wait.

195
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
My inner energy is slowly recovering.

196
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
I must avenge my death today.

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I must have your child.

198
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Who?

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Who?

200
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
What are you doing here?

201
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Of course I'm here to see you, my beauty.

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
What Ni Yuanzhou did is really too stupid.

203
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
But

204
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
in this world,

205
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
there are many good men

206
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
in this world except him.

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
For example,

208
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Xiao Ke is a man of great power.

209
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
He has the appearance of a man who has never been in love.

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
He is a man of great beauty.

211
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
He is a gentle woman.

212
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
He is a gentle man.

213
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
He is a gentle man.

214
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I am the best man

215
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
who is the father of your child.

216
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Get out.

217
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Heroes are not as good as the dead.

218
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
How dare a beauty die?

219
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
And I'm especially willing to die in your hands.

220
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Because only in this way,

221
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
you can be my wife forever.

222
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Come on.

223
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Don't be afraid because I'm a man of great power.

224
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
I can take it.

225
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Enough.

226
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
It's time to go back and take some tonics.

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
By the way,

228
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
he is really stupid.

229
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Stop.

230
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Stop.

231
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
You...

232
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
He was in the room just now.

233
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I was outside the door.

234
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
He was just now.

235
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
He was in the room.

236
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I was also outside the door.

237
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Ning Nai.

238
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Actually, I've decided that it's you

239
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
who will die with me forever.

240
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Your fairy-like charm

241
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
is really something.

242
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
You don't have any feelings for me.

243
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Don't be afraid.

244
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
You can escape from this.

245
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
You can't escape from this.

246
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Hao.

247
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
You haven't slept yet?

248
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm going to the building.

249
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Thank you.

250
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
It's okay.

251
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I'll go to the backyard.

252
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Okay.

253
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Why is there a horse missing?

254
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
There is indeed a horse missing.

255
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Let's go.

256
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Sir.

257
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Sir.

258
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Sir.

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
You'll regret it.

260
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Let's go.

261
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
See?

262
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
She left.

263
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm also nervous.

264
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
She didn't even do anything.

265
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
It's good now.

266
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
The beauty ran away.

267
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Who taught the princess?

268
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Shut up.

269
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I found the horse's hoof.

270
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Go in the direction of the boat.

271
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Look at the soil.

272
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
It's about an hour before.

273
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Okay.

274
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Tao Er.

275
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Give me the puzzle.

276
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Puzzle.

277
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I'll be back before the time of death tomorrow.

278
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
During this period,

279
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
everything must be done with the money.

280
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Okay.

281
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
I'll go with you.

282
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Let the parents handle the child.

283
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Don't interfere.

284
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
It's useless to insert a hair.

285
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
What child?

286
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
What parents?

287
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Children are not allowed to ask about adults.

288
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm not a child.

289
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
I can ask.

290
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Old Yu.

291
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
No.

292
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Qian Zhong.

293
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Ren Luo.

294
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Go.

295
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Go.

296
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Shuyi.

297
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Get up.

298
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Sir.

299
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Please spare my life, sir.

300
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Linglong could have escaped on her own.

301
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
But she rushed back to the branch to report to you.

302
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
You're her fiance.

303
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Why didn't you save her?

304
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
It's...

305
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
It's all Mr. Yue's force.

306
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Linglong and I are in love.

307
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
But Mr. Yue values us.

308
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
He forced me to serve him.

309
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
You and Linglong are in love?

310
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Sir.

311
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I only have her in my heart.

312
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Only her?

313
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
We've taken you to the garden.

314
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Don't you remember?

315
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I...

316
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I was forced.

317
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Sir.

318
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Please spare my life.

319
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I'll spare you if you tell me the truth about Mr. Yue.

320
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I'll tell you.

321
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Mr. Yue.

322
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
He's the eldest son of Zhu Yiwei in Wu State.

323
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Zi Yishi.

324
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Yue Sanniang.

325
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Yes?

326
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
After Linglong reported to me that the news was out,

327
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Yue Sanniang thought this was a good opportunity to kill the dog.

328
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
She sent an order to send everyone to the branch.

329
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
I will gather them separately.

330
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Who is the one who ordered the extermination?

331
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
It's about the confidential information. Yue Sanliu didn't tell me.

332
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I... I just have a toy in my hand.

333
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Close your eyes.

334
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Sir, didn't you say that as long as I say my identity, you will forgive me?

335
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
If you change your name to Chu Zhan, you will also forgive me.

336
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Sir, kill...

337
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Since you and Linglong have a mutual love,

338
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
you can't live alone even if he dies.

339
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
How did you find this place?

340
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
The spies from Luyang.

341
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
When I asked Qian Zhao to heal you,

342
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I added some spies to the medicine.

343
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
No matter where you are,

344
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
the spies can be tracked.

345
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
You are really cunning.

346
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I'm flattered.

347
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
I don't understand.

348
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Don't you know that Mr. Yue is Yue Sanliu?

349
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Why do you ask him again?

350
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Zhang Zeng said that

351
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,600
if you don't pass the multiple tests,

352
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
you are a fool.

353
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
You learned fast.

354
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
So you didn't plan to live in a famous place.

355
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
You decided to revenge.

356
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Otherwise, you would have kept Yu Lang alive.

357
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Yes, I'm not you.

358
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I was abandoned by the Six Halls,

359
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
but I still have to sell my life for him.

360
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Fourthly...

361
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
How many people are on your list?

362
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Many.

363
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I will send all the people who hurt you and Linglong

364
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
to the right place.

365
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,600
So you have already decided to kill him.

366
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Of course.

367
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I know that Yu Lang's hometown is nearby.

368
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I planned to kill him tomorrow.

369
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
What?

370
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Are you afraid that I will leave here

371
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
and abandon the princess?

372
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Don't worry.

373
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I'm not like you.

374
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I won't betray you.

375
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I know you won't betray me.

376
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
But I want to ask,

377
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I won't be on this list, right?

378
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
If you regret and change your mind

379
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
after entering the country,

380
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
and don't help me find out the murderer who killed the princess,

381
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
I will send you to be her partner.

382
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
You can't beat me.

383
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
You can hide for a while,

384
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
but you can't hide forever.

385
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
The Six Halls have hell.

386
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
You should know that

387
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
the killer is more patient than others.

388
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Don't worry.

389
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
I will keep my promise.

390
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
But you have to promise me

391
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
that you won't leave the delegation without my permission.

392
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Because you will attract attention

393
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
when you kill someone.

394
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
This will affect our rescue plan

395
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
and the security of the delegation.

396
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Why?

397
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
This is not within the range of our transactions.

398
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,600
You want to avenge the queen.

399
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
You are much stronger than me

400
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
in saving Wu Di.

401
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Now you are asking me...

402
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Why don't you hide?

403
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
I'm not hiding.

404
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
I owe you.

405
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I have to let you get out of this vicious trap.

406
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I'm going out to kill people.

407
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
You can't bear to leave.

408
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
If I die,

409
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,600
who will investigate the murderer who killed the queen for you?

410
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Yes. I can't bear to leave.

411
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
I like you

412
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
so much.

413
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
So,

414
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,600
you will be my child's father.

415
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Don't think about it. This is impossible.

416
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,600
What if I poison the whole delegation?

417
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
You won't obey.

418
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Of course I won't.

419
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Because at that time,

420
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
your aunt Ouyang's life

421
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
must be in my hands.

422
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
You want to threaten me with her?

423
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Dream on.

424
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Just a stepmother.

425
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
I can even disregard my own mother's life.

426
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Really?

427
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Then why do you disregard your life

428
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
and kill Mr. Lu Qingqiang and Mr. Yue?

429
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Just for the revenge of that good-for-nothing Bai Que Linglong.

430
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
You

431
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,600
are much more soft-hearted than you think.

432
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
What I said just now

434
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
might be a little harsh.

435
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Don't mind it.

436
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Zhen Ruoyi!

438
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Mr. Ning.

439
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
You are actually much more soft-hearted

440
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
than you think.

441
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Why did you reject me?

442
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Did you lose anything

443
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
while being with me?

444
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
I was Bai Que.

445
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I know

446
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
what kind of women

447
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
men like.

448
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Is she the beautiful Hu Ji

449
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
in the Nine Halls of the Lord?

450
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Or the dignified Gui Xiu

451
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,600
in the Seven Gates of the City?

452
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Is she the cold and lonely

453
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
and lonely person

454
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
or the one with thorns

455
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
and the one with a fiery rose?

456
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I can satisfy

457
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
all your fantasies.

458
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Okay, enough playing.

459
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
It's time to go back.

460
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
To be honest,

461
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Bai Que is quite

462
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
ordinary.

463
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Pretty ordinary.

464
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I'll help you.

465
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Nian Tao.

466
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Ru Yi.

467
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Yesterday, the secret envoy from the palace

468
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
suddenly came to Sha Ji Town.

469
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
He was in a hurry to ask for the official.

470
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
But this matter

471
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
should be kept secret

472
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
from His Highness and Lord Du.

473
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Do you understand?

474
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Yes.

475
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Follow me.

476
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You are indeed the leader of the Six Halls.

477
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
You can lie to me.

478
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm doing this for your sake

479
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
and for the morale of the delegation.

480
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
But I'll say it again.

481
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
You can't leave without my permission.

482
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Otherwise, our deal will be in vain.

483
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Our deal

484
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
is only for me to teach

485
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Anguo about the secret envoy.

486
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
But it doesn't include

487
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
the drug and torture

488
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
he has to deal with.

489
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I'll handle this.

490
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
How is His Highness?

491
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
He's awake.

492
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
But he won't say a word

493
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
or eat anything

494
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
no matter what I say.

495
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll go and see him.

496
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
He's back.

497
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
He really didn't consider

498
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
my suggestion yesterday.

499
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm really not bad.

500
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm not worse than him.

501
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Yu Ri San.

502
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Ruyi is a companion

503
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
we must respect.

504
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
She's not a woman

505
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
you can laugh at.

506
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Did I laugh at her?

507
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I didn't laugh at her.

508
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Besides, when did you see

509
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
that I didn't respect a woman

510
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
and didn't mean it?

511
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
As long as she didn't

512
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
say anything to you,

513
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
every word you say

514
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
is a laugh at her

515
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
and a disrespect.

516
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Not to mention in front of others.

517
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Okay.

518
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I was just dreaming.

519
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Ruyi, I'm sorry.

520
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
I promise you again

521
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I won't be like this again.

522
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
From now on, I'll only be silent

523
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
and sincere.

524
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
I'll try my best to move you.

525
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
One day,

526
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
you'll find out my kindness to you.

527
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Don't listen to

528
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
what Ning Yuan Zhou says.

529
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
He's just pretending.

530
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
He's too timid to see my kindness to you.

531
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
He only chooses to listen to

532
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
such a big talker.

533
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I've been used to it for a long time.

534
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Your Highness,

535
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,600
you'd better eat something.

536
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I don't want to eat.

537
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
If you don't let me go back to the capital,

538
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
I'll die here.

539
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
How can you say

540
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
such a sad thing?

541
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
You are the legitimate

542
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Li Wang Ying's heir.

543
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
His Majesty's name,

544
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
and Da Wu's future

545
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
are all waiting for you

546
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
to come to Qin Tian to protect you.

547
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm not Li Wang,

548
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm a princess.

549
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm a little lady.

550
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I don't know the court,

551
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
I don't know the military history,

552
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I don't know the country.

553
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
I don't know the country.

554
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I don't know the court,

555
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I don't know anything about the military history.

556
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I just want to go back and ask

557
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
the Emperor and the Empress Dowager.

558
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Why did they lie to me like this?

559
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Why?

560
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Why are you here?

561
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Go away.

562
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Go away.

563
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
What are you doing?

564
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
The new king's son

565
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
You can't kill him!

566
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Please spare my life, Your Excellency!

567
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
If a person who is not a king is not a king,

568
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
he will be far away from the throne.

569
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Otherwise, he will be a bad person.

570
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Your Highness, please remember,

571
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
this is the first person who died for you.

572
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I won't marry him!

573
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I... I am the King of Qin!

574
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I order you to let him go!

575
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
An outsider does not obey the order of the inner court.

576
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
You just said,

577
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
you are a princess.

578
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Don't kill him!

579
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
As long as you don't kill him, I will promise you everything!

580
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Then, Your Highness,

581
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
do you want to continue?

582
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Brother An Zhuo,

583
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
you are threatening me.

584
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I am already like this.

585
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
You still want to force me?

586
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Fine.

587
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
If you want to kill him, then kill him.

588
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
At worst,

589
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
if he dies, I will turn around and go to the prison.

590
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
This way, I will be defeated on the way to the imperial palace.

591
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Please spare my life, Your Excellency!

592
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Your Highness, you are heartbroken.

593
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
You have a sprain in your ankle.

594
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Please spare my life!

595
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Please spare my life!

596
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Please spare my life!

597
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Find the empty room in the hall.

598
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
The official will be here.

599
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Let's go.

600
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Ying,

601
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
this is not that simple.

602
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
You have to be stronger now.

603
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I have been deceived by you all to death!

604
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
How do you want me to be strong?

605
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
You know that

606
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
I grew up in the palace.

607
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
I can't fall for it.

608
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I can't fall for it.

609
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
I can't fall for it.

610
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
I can't fall for it.

611
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I can't fall for it.

612
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I am not here.

613
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Except for the old maid,

614
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
the maid,

615
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
and the maid maid,

616
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,600
no one can see me as a serious master.

617
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
I just want to be free.

618
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,600
I just want to save you from the prison.

619
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,600
I just want to be a princess of 8 billion.

620
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
But who would have thought that

621
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
my brother

622
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
and my sister-in-law

623
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
are my sisters-in-law?

624
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
They are all

625
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
in my shoes,

626
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
all of them.

627
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
They are all

628
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
in my shoes,

629
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
all of them.

630
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Why?

631
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
Why?

632
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Why?

633
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
I'll go.

634
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
You can't eat soft food.

635
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
I don't want to hear it!

636
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
I'm sorry, Brother Yuan Zhou.

637
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
I didn't mean to hit you.

638
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Does it hurt?

639
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
You did it for me.

640
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Let's go.

641
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
I'll show you.

642
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
You must arrange

643
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
your daily meals.

644
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Help!

645
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
I'm falling!

646
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Brother Yuan Zhou, what are you doing?

647
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm following the order of the empress.

648
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
This is the law.

649
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
All of you, get out!

650
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Yes, sir!

651
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
No one can save you now.

652
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I brought you here

653
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
to show you

654
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
the country that your family is in charge of.

655
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
We are now

656
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
in Baisha Town.

657
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Over there

658
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
is Sha Xi Town.

659
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Far away

660
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
is your birthplace,

661
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
the universe.

662
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
That is the universe?

663
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Yes.

664
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
The universe is 20 miles away.

665
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
There are 14,500 people living there.

666
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
There are many rivers and rivers in the city.

667
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
There are many fish and rice.

668
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Do you know

669
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
how many cities

670
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
are there in the world?

671
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
38 cities in total.

672
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
But just because

673
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
your brother

674
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
was so reckless

675
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
that he lost three cities

676
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
because of his reckless war.

677
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Those who are in charge should love you.

678
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Those who are against you should live in peace.

679
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
This is the great cause of the world.

680
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
But he is so cruel

681
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
that he let more than 100,000 people

682
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
suffer from war

683
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
and died.

684
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
You can talk to me about

685
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
what is the most perfect.

686
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
But it's not my business.

687
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
I have been in the palace since I was a child.

688
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
But as long as your surname is Yang,

689
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
this matter is related to you.

690
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Although you are in the Leng Palace,

691
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
you are not in the right position.

692
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
But with the blood of the Yang family,

693
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
you enjoy the wealth and glory

694
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
that ordinary people can't enjoy for a lifetime.

695
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Although you are not valued,

696
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
as a princess,

697
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
you have at least 500 yuan a year.

698
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
But do you know that

699
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
those who died with your brother

700
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
only have one gold

701
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
after they died?

702
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Really?

703
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
The Red State has been in power for only 50 years.

704
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
These people have never been

705
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
benefited by the Yang family.

706
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Yes.

707
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
You can be afraid of death.

708
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
You can escape.

709
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
But if you are in the state of peace,

710
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
we can't live.

711
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Yang Ying, please remember.

712
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
The whole delegation ordered

713
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
me and Mr. Du to send a horse to the inner city.

714
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
They are willing to

715
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
go with you with their lives.

716
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
They are not because of the fish.

717
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
They are not for the sake of family and military officials.

718
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
They are just to make the people of the two countries

719
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
less afraid of the fire.

720
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
For those who died in the battlefield,

721
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
they are just to make the people of the two countries

722
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
less afraid of the fire.

723
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Do you agree?

724
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Yes.

725
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
You said you were not willing to.

726
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
You want to escape to the capital.

727
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
You want to go back and ask the people.

728
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Why?

729
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Have you ever thought about

730
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
whether the people of the battlefield

731
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
have anything to do with it?

732
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Why?

733
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
When you and the delegation were in the capital,

734
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
have you ever thought that once the fire is put out,

735
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
they might all die in your hands?

736
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
I'm sorry.

737
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
I'm sorry.

738
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm sorry.

739
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
A-Yang,

740
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
crying is useless.

741
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Since you have made the decision,

742
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
you have to persist.

743
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
You have no way out.

744
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
The An family was weak before.

745
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
But as long as you start today,

746
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
be firm and think about it,

747
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
I and all of the delegation

748
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
will die with you.

749
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Really?

750
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
I swear,

751
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
I will not run away again.

752
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
I will be strong.

753
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Okay.

754
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Prince,

755
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
I'm sorry.

756
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm sorry.

757
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
I'm sorry.

758
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
I'm sorry.

759
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Prince committed the crime

760
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
with the common people.

761
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
He was not a member of the army.

762
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Prince Li,

763
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
for his own personal gain,

764
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
poisoned his food.

765
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
There were 69 people in the delegation.

766
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
I would rather

767
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
give up my life

768
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
and let Chu Qi go on a hunger strike.

769
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
This order...

770
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
I'll take this.

771
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
How about I take the blame for His Highness?

772
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Can I?

773
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Lord Ning,

774
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,600
you have to take care of His Highness's dignity.

775
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Did he remember

776
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
the royal family's dignity

777
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
when he poisoned?

778
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Lord Du, you don't have to say it.

779
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
No one needs to think about it.

780
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
This is a good deed.

781
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
to be a good friend.

782
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
But,

783
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
what you said just now is reasonable.

784
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,600
It's not good to act in public.

785
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
I'll take you to the room to act.

786
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
You all remember,

787
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,600
if there is any suspicion in the delegation,

788
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
King Li will be the sword of the front car.

789
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Attack!

790
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Yes.

791
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Okay,

792
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
go to fix it.

793
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
We'll leave after two hours.

794
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Yes.

795
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Please.

796
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Let me do it.

797
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
You're just a scary person.

798
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
When there is no one,

799
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
you may not be able to do it.

800
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
It's still Ruyi who can do it.

801
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Yes,

802
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I can hear the sound of the flute.

803
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
It's really cruel.

804
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Beauty is very loving,

805
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
I don't know how cunning she is.

806
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
You actually rejected her.

807
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
I will remember to burn incense for you in the future.

808
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
I'm too lazy to bother you.

809
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
If you tell me

810
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
that you are willing to dress up as a man

811
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
and show the real reason of the peace,

812
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,600
I can remember the rest of the time.

813
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
A princess who has been in the palace for a long time,

814
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
what kind of freedom can she be free to do everything for?

815
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I'm afraid that

816
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
you can't do anything for her.

817
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
I'm afraid that

818
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
you can't do anything for her.

819
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
They don't understand men,

820
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
but I do.

821
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Tell me.

822
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,600
There is a guard from the imperial court,

823
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,600
his name is Zheng Qingyun.

824
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,600
So you just

825
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
dress up as a man

826
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
just because you want to marry him.

827
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Have you ever thought

828
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
if you really escaped last night,

829
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
would you be locked in the palace?

830
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Until you die,

831
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,600
you will never see your Zheng again.

832
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,600
No, I just want to go back and ask my sister-in-law.

833
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
If you ask her,

834
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,600
will she admit that she wants to send you to die?

835
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
No, she will only think that

836
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
you are a trouble that needs to be solved.

837
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Do you really think that

838
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
you are the only one in the country

839
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
who can do this?

840
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Wrong.

841
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
The news that King Li has made

842
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
has been known to the world.

843
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm afraid that you can find someone

844
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
to wear a man-made mask

845
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
and dress up as you.

846
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
How is that possible?

847
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Kneel.

848
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
How is that possible?

849
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Is it more likely than you?

850
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,600
I can dress up as Li Wan,

851
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
but I can't be a man-made man.

852
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
I can only be a man-made man.

853
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
I can only be a man-made man.

854
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
I can only be a man-made man.

855
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,600
I understand, but I don't want to.

856
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,600
First, I'm not a man-made man.

857
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,600
Second, I found that

858
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
you are actually bigger and smarter

859
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,600
than I thought.

860
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
You can cry and talk,

861
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
and move your body,

862
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
and poison the whole Group.

863
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
With this talent,

864
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
I can see you clearly.

865
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,600
If you can learn it well,

866
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
you might not become

867
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,600
a woman more powerful than your sister-in-law.

868
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Really?

869
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Why should I lie to you?

870
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,600
I can really be as powerful as

871
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,600
Ruyi and you in the future.

872
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Yes.

873
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
By then,

874
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,600
you can not only marry Zheng Qingyun,

875
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
but also humiliate all your wives.

876
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,600
If you look down on your people,

877
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,600
you will be trampled by them.

878
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Like this.

879
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Come here.

880
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Like this.

881
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,600
Come here.

882
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,600
I want to get rid of all your hatred

883
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,600
and all your pride.

884
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,600
I did it.

885
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
I did it.

886
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Now tell me who you are.

887
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,600
I am the King of Wuli.

888
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,600
Did you hear it?

889
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,600
Thank you.

890
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,600
You are more thoughtful than me.

891
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
There are some things

892
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
that he has to figure out

893
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
before he can face it bravely.

894
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
It's just an old trick

895
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,600
that Gu Li used to use.

896
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
It's not worth mentioning.

897
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Hurry up and write a letter back.

898
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Control Zheng Qingyun.

899
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,600
At least let him write a letter

900
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,600
to calm his heart.

901
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Ren Ruyi.

902
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
I want to ask you.

903
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,600
What you are doing now

904
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
is actually beyond

905
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,600
our cooperation.

906
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Why did you help me?

907
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Because you looked so arrogant

908
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
and I liked it.

909
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,600
Alright.

910
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,600
I will be the one who is helping you.

911
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,600
If you can't do it,

912
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
then I will change a new strategy.

913
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
You are soft-hearted.

914
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
I will help you a few times.

915
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
You will be able to get through it.

916
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
If that's the case,

917
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
then I advise you to give up.

918
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
Because I will never have any feelings

919
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
with my partner.

920
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,600
You are too self-willed.

921
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
I just want to give birth to a child with you.

922
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,600
Who wants to have feelings with you?

923
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
What?

924
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,600
What's wrong?

925
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,600
You...you want to have a baby

926
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,600
with Sister Ruyi?

927
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,600
What are you talking about?

928
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
You are just a child.

929
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,600
Tao, I am already 18.

930
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,600
Why do you still take me as a child?

931
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Even if you are already 80,

932
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,600
you are still a child in my eyes.

933
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
I...

934
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Have you been playing with the dead recently?

935
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,600
So you and Sister Ruyi are...

936
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,600
Stop asking, alright?

937
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
Go and see if the horse is ready.

938
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,600
We are about to set off.

939
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Hurry up.

940
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,600
The wind blows into tears

941
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,600
Who drinks from the snow

942
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,600
and falls into ashes

943
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Who wants to be together for life

944
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,600
and leave the world behind

945
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,600
Looking back at the past

946
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,600
The world is so precious

947
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,600
Who will stay with the rest of their lives

948
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,600
Who is worried about the heart

949
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,600
who is fearless

950
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
Who is afraid that a dream will come true

951
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,600
and only the wind will come back

952
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Who is going to go down the snow

953
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:03,600
How many years have passed

954
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:11,600
and no one has ever been drunk
