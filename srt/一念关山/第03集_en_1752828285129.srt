1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,720
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Let's go.

61
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
The door is locked.

62
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
You didn't pay attention to Wei Da?

63
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Then why did you

64
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,640
pay attention to the 18th father of Wei Du Men?

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
The taste in memory

66
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
to preserve this green chrysanthemum tea

67
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
invites you to watch the one-sided mountain.

68
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Doctor Xuan, someone is coming.

69
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Your Highness.

70
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
You don't want the King of the Sakuragi to go out to drink the ground.

71
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Do you want to go yourself?

72
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Your Highness.

73
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
I, the fourth son of the Emperor, Yang Ying,

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
greet the King of the Sakuragi.

75
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
The fourth son of the Emperor?

76
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I, the fourth son of the Emperor, Yang Ying,

77
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
greet the King of the Sakuragi.

78
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Yang Ying?

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
The King of the Sakuragi,

80
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
you are in charge of state affairs.

81
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,640
You are not in good health.

82
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
If that's the case,

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
why don't you let me be the ambassador of the Sakuragi?

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,640
The Emperor of the Sakuragi is very kind.

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

87
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
You may not know,

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
that Emperor Ying has been ill since he was young.

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
The late emperor was instructed by the high monk

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,640
to help him enter the imperial palace after he was an adult.

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Although Emperor Ying was not crowned,

93
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,640
he was the blood of the late emperor.

94
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
For this matter,

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I, the Prince of Danyang,

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,640
heard the late emperor repeatedly mention it.

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Prince of Danyang is not a person who can be trusted.

98
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,640
He is not a person who can be trusted.

99
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Prince of Danyang is not a person who can be trusted.

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Ying,

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,640
do you know how dangerous it is to go to the state of An this time?

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Do you really want to be the ambassador of the Sakuragi?

103
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Of course I know it's dangerous.

104
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
But,

105
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,640
as long as you also give me a prince as powerful as you,

106
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
and reward me with many things,

107
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
I'm not afraid.

108
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
You're lying.

109
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Brother,

110
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
I really want to marry him.

111
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
His Majesty is also my brother.

112
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I also hope he will come back soon.

113
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
As long as I can marry General Jin,

114
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
no matter if he is a princess or a prince.

115
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,640
The fourth prince is a royal member of the palace.

116
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,640
I beg Your Highness to give the order

117
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
to confer the title of the fourth prince, Yang Ying,

118
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
as the crown prince.

119
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
I agree.

120
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
I also agree.

121
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Ying,

122
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
you really think it over.

123
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
You won't regret it.

124
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Okay.

125
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Give the order.

126
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,640
The four sons of the emperor, Yang Ying, are the king of the great Wu Li.

127
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,640
They will be held on the day of the festival and will be sent to the state of An.

128
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
They will be brought back to the emperor.

129
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
Your Highness is wise.

130
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Your Highness.

131
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
It's okay.

132
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Your Highness.

133
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Your Highness.

134
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Why are you so stupid?

135
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm not stupid.

136
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
I can be the prince now.

137
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
It doesn't matter.

138
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,640
As long as I can get my brother back,

139
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,640
I can be more honorable than my elder sister.

140
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
I can also get rid of Yuan Zhou's crime.

141
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
I can also be with you.

142
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
But An Guo Ren,

143
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
if he finds out that you are a fake prince,

144
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
you will die.

145
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm not a fake prince.

146
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
I'm also the father's child.

147
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Look.

148
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
I was a princess before.

149
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
I've been a princess for so long.

150
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
I only have two little maids.

151
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
But now I've just been conferred.

152
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Sister-in-law has given me eight maids.

153
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,640
What's wrong with such a glorious day?

154
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Don't look at me like that, okay?

155
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Otherwise,

156
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,640
I finally have the courage to stand up.

157
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
It will be gone soon.

158
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Actually, I was afraid of him just now.

159
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,640
But I really don't want to be in the palace.

160
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,640
I want to be a princess who is free and has no power.

161
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
But Your Highness,

162
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
An Guo Li is thousands of miles away from here.

163
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
But you haven't even left the palace.

164
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
An Di, Li Sun,

165
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,640
fought against his brother, the Crown Prince,

166
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
and then ascended the throne.

167
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
That's it.

168
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Your Highness.

169
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Your Highness.

170
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Wake up.

171
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Sorry, Sister-in-law.

172
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
I didn't mean to fall asleep.

173
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
I'm just a little sleepy.

174
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
You've been studying for two hours.

175
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
It's time to rest.

176
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm not sleepy.

177
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Please continue to teach me.

178
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
No, continue to teach me.

179
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
What you want is this spirit.

180
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Remember,

181
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
you are always the son of the Great Wu.

182
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
But, Sister-in-law,

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
I beg you.

184
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Don't worry.

185
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Don't worry.

186
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,640
You promised your brother that you would pardon Ning Yuan Zhou's crime

187
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
and let the Ministry of War call him back to the capital.

188
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Lord Ning is still alive.

189
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Lord Ning is still alive.

190
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Come out.

191
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
It's us.

192
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Have you finished cooking?

193
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Yes.

194
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I'll go get it right now.

195
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Wait.

196
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Get me a basin of water.

197
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
I'll wash my hands.

198
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Let me help you.

199
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
It's a sweet osmanthus bean paste bun.

200
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
It smells so good.

201
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Then eat more.

202
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Didn't you make white-chip buns?

203
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
You can cook too.

204
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm not a good cook.

205
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
I'm just a little bit of a cook.

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm just a little bit of a cook.

207
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm just a little bit of a cook.

208
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I'm just a little bit of a cook.

209
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,640
This sweet osmanthus bean paste bun is shaped like a rabbit?

210
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
It doesn't look like a white-chip bun.

211
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
You must be mistaken.

212
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
Don't pretend.

213
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I can smell the white-chip bun even from 30 miles away.

214
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Even from 30 miles away?

215
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,640
You have such a sharp nose, you must be a dog owner.

216
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm 30 years old.

217
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
That makes me a dog owner.

218
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Eat the sugar-cone.

219
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,160
can you taste the Search for the Craneading嗎 dakika

220
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
for talking this much

221
00:10:49,960 --> 00:11:08,240
Don't you fear the poison of the

222
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Let's eat together, sister.

223
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
The food is getting cold.

224
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Thank you.

225
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,640
This bean paste bun, how do you eat it?

226
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
It's a bit like the cow's hair in the village.

227
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Really?

228
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Does it smell good?

229
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Yuan Xiao Ge.

230
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
You eat this.

231
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
This is delicious.

232
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Childe, you eat this.

233
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
This is suitable for you.

234
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Thank you, sister.

235
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I forgot.

236
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I don't know what your name is.

237
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
My name is Ren.

238
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
My name is Ru Yi.

239
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I'm from the hometown of Ru Yi.

240
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Good name.

241
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Yuan Luo.

242
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Do you remember the village we lived in before?

243
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
There was a dog named Ru Yi in the village.

244
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
He bit me.

245
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Really?

246
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Yes.

247
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
I was so scared.

248
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
I was so scared.

249
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
I was so scared.

250
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
I was so scared.

251
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Really?

252
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm done eating.

253
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
I'll go to the backyard to wash my clothes.

254
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Caoer.

255
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Can't you learn from Brother 13 to talk properly?

256
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Look.

257
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
He's been taken away.

258
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
What do you know?

259
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
I deliberately tested him.

260
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Test?

261
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
He's a dancer.

262
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
A dancer?

263
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
He's so ungrateful.

264
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
It means that he was very arrogant before.

265
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Or he just did the white blood for a few days.

266
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Why do I feel that

267
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
since he bit you last time,

268
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
you've been treating him like this?

269
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,640
You're very polite to other girls.

270
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Enough. I know.

271
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Eat your food.

272
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Brother Yuan Zhao.

273
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
You're still alive.

274
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
When did you come back?

275
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
His Highness is still in the Ministry of War.

276
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I just came back.

277
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
I just knew that you were alive.

278
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
So I came to see you.

279
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
How are you?

280
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Are you hurt?

281
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I'm fine.

282
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
I'm fine.

283
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm fine.

284
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm fine.

285
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I'm fine.

286
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
I'm fine.

287
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
I'm fine.

288
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I'm fine.

289
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm fine.

290
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm fine.

291
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I'm fine.

292
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
I'm fine.

293
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm fine.

294
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
I'm fine.

295
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
I'm fine.

296
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm fine.

297
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Are you doing well recently?

298
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
You haven't been married to Yang family yet.

299
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Brother Yuan Zhao.

300
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,640
When did you go to buy clothes for him?

301
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Who is he?

302
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
This...

303
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,640
This is my neighbor.

304
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Let me introduce.

305
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
This is my cousin.

306
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
I'll go first.

307
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,640
I see that you are not ordinary in your clothes.

308
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,640
You are not ordinary in your clothes.

309
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I think it's for Gao Men's daughter.

310
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
She has seen me today.

311
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Maybe she will tell others that I'm here.

312
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Cousin.

313
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,640
If someone doubts that you have a spy cousin.

314
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
It's not good.

315
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,640
You can't do anything well.

316
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
You are so bad at cooking.

317
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,640
But you are full of bad things.

318
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
What do you want to do?

319
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Take me out of the city.

320
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
As soon as I leave the city gate.

321
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
I'll leave immediately.

322
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,640
I won't bother you again.

323
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Ok.

324
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Really?

325
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Yes.

326
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Thank you cousin.

327
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
This is what the person left in the wine cellar.

328
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
You let someone give it to me.

329
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Yes.

330
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
What's wrong?

331
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,640
This is the special guest of Zhu Yiwei.

332
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,640
The only person who is qualified to use him is Gao Jie Zhu Yiwei.

333
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
This person is not a small person.

334
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
If he is alive and returns to headquarters.

335
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Then the news of our cooperation.

336
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
I'm afraid I can't hide it.

337
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,640
I'm afraid Mr. Yue is in danger.

338
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,640
You are going to close the case.

339
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Now the news of your six Daoist churches.

340
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
The news of Xie Lu Gui's national army.

341
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,640
I just need to add a fire.

342
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Can make this news be known to the world.

343
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Nonsense.

344
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Six Daoist churches have always been loyal.

345
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,640
The emperor's illness is completely his own enemy.

346
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Even if you haven't done it.

347
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
There are many people talking.

348
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Just do it.

349
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
What do you want?

350
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
After using Wan Dujie.

351
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
In a period of time.

352
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
This person will be exhausted.

353
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,640
If he wants to send the news back to headquarters.

354
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Most likely to go to the branches of the branches.

355
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
To change the name of the brother.

356
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,640
The closest branch of Li Jing is Kaiyang and Tianjin.

357
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
I need to set up an ambush in these two places.

358
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Zhu Yiwei of Wudu has died.

359
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
I need people.

360
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Mr. Zhao is not here.

361
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
I can only give you six people.

362
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Not enough.

363
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
At least ten.

364
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
You remember.

365
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
We are now a rope on the horse.

366
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
If this person is alive.

367
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Except for the witch.

368
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
You and I have to die.

369
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
Taoer.

370
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Taoer.

371
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
What's wrong?

372
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
I just went to buy the medicine on the road.

373
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I heard one thing.

374
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Zhu Yiwei's Wudu branch.

375
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
The people who were called the night before.

376
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
All broken.

377
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
All broken.

378
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
This Zhu Yiwei's Wudu branch.

379
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
It's been running well these years.

380
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
And when I was here.

381
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Never reported.

382
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Can actually let Zhao Ji break me.

383
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Unless they are their own internal affairs.

384
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Or.

385
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Someone should be out of line.

386
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm not ashamed to say.

387
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
I guessed it right.

388
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
I heard that the farmer named Luo Qingxianghai.

389
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Mr. Yue.

390
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I guess at least he is a purple doctor.

391
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Then let's put it back.

392
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,640
This is not a small thing.

393
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
I was not killed by Zhao Ji.

394
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm not talking about this.

395
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm talking about Miss Ru Yi.

396
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
If she really escaped.

397
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Then her luck would be too good.

398
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
You just thought.

399
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Wasn't it you who wanted to keep her?

400
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
I'm not looking at her poor.

401
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Or you can try her again.

402
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
How to try?

403
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
What if it comes out?

404
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
You also ate her bean paste buns.

405
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
What to do?

406
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm kidding you.

407
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Whether she is a person who is not a doctor.

408
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
No matter what she did.

409
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
We are not people who are in the bath house now.

410
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
It has nothing to do with us.

411
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Can save her life.

412
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Just take it as a good luck.

413
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
But.

414
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
This Zhao Ji's death is one day late.

415
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
The brothers are in danger.

416
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,640
So we will leave early tomorrow morning.

417
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
it is good.

418
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Did you eat the candy today?

419
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Not yet.

420
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Go back and rest.

421
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
We will leave early tomorrow.

422
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
it is good.

423
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Did you hear it?

424
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Remember what you said.

425
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Tomorrow morning.

426
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
After the door is closed.

427
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
We have no connection.

428
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
I have you.

429
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Aren't you watching or not?

430
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Dong Song.

431
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Hurry up.

432
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Plus one.

433
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Old Zhao.

434
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
The sisters' brothers.

435
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
They have no problem.

436
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
let go.

437
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
He wants to ride a horse too.

438
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
so that he can walk faster.

439
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,360
Thank you.

440
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,680
But I don't know how to ride a horse.

441
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,400
Okay.

442
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
Take care.

443
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,200
Thank you for saving my life.

444
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,440
Don't.

445
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,240
The one who saved your life is Ning Tong.

446
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,640
If she hadn't killed Zhao Ji,

447
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,560
we would have...

448
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,480
I owe you a life.

449
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,200
You're welcome.

450
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
I ate your bean paste buns.

451
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,400
We're even now.

452
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,520
Let's go, Yue Lu.

453
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,280
If you want to go to the Net,

454
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
go to the open field of Lu Zhou and listen to the sound of the drum.

455
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,240
Zhao Ji's party has already gone in that direction.

456
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,800
I don't understand.

457
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,920
I want to go back to my hometown in Shengzhou.

458
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,000
Let's go.

459
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,280
Go.

460
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Ning Yuan Zhou.

461
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,280
Yuan Ruo!

462
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,380
We can do this when we're in harm's way!

463
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,680
Sister Ruyi!

464
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:28,640
Didn't you say you didn't have inner energy?

465
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,900
You said you didn't have inner energy?

466
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,980
You couldn't still do that?

467
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,360
You can kill any flora and fauna inside the boat.

468
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,300
point initial

469
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,260
meeting

470
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,840
I'm a wa

471
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,840
Shoot them at will.

472
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,200
Stop it.

473
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
Come on! I'll shoot!

474
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,120
But… it may be Lord Commander.

475
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,080
If you believe me,

476
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,760
I will cut three of your bones!

477
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
I cut his bone

478
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,840
in person.

479
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,120
Cheese.

480
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,080
Turn back.

481
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,720
Let's go.

482
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Continue shooting.

483
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,780
After her.

484
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,440
One week, I cannot have more time,

485
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:32,100
right

486
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,640
Let me teach you a good lesson.

487
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,780
Obey me.

488
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,060
Come on, hurry up.

489
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,020
Stop!

490
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,800
He's the first.

491
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
I'm sorry.

492
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,700
Listen up.

493
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,700
Don't be rude to Master Ning's friend.

494
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,700
Please.

495
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,500
od

496
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,820
Prime Minister,

497
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
I hope to know you well,

498
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,100
who I am on a small scale,

499
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,620
I can't Jimin group all the people during this period.

500
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:16,620
Help me

501
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,620
Tell me.

502
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,420
In the minds of the six Taoist churches,

503
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,420
what is a swordsman?

504
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,620
A spy, a assassinator,

505
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,820
and a person who bribes people.

506
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,020
These little things

507
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,220
can only be done by raising a few heroes.

508
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,420
But why does the court

509
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
have to spend one-sixth of the military budget every year

510
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,220
to support your six churches?

511
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,820
Ning Yuanzhou's martial arts

512
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,220
may be a little better than yours,

513
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,620
but his skills are much better than yours.

514
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,020
There are thousands of people in the six churches.

515
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,420
Only he knows

516
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,620
the real role of swordsmen in the court.

517
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
It's not assassinating,

518
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
it's not stealing,

519
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,820
but collecting and organizing

520
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,220
the real money for the state affairs.

521
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,420
But after your Hall Leader Ning left,

522
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,020
Zhao Ji was idle and left the hell.

523
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,420
He abandoned the Sun Luo Hall.

524
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,420
It's because His Majesty got the money before he went on a expedition.

525
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,220
Ten to nine of them are fake.

526
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,220
Why?

527
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,620
It's because the State Security Guard of the State of An

528
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,020
is not a vegetarian.

529
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,220
They also release fake news.

530
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,420
The information that has not been verified

531
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,220
is false.

532
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,820
Zhao Ji's relative died just now.

533
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,820
I didn't do anything.

534
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,020
Because in my eyes,

535
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,020
he can't even compare to

536
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
a single hair of your Hall Leader Ning.

537
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,220
You're over thinking.

538
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,220
Actually, I didn't wear a high hat for you.

539
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,820
This time, I was captured.

540
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
The only way to defeat Ying is in the six churches.

541
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,420
To be honest,

542
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,220
I admired your talent a long time ago.

543
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,220
But you never want to do anything for me.

544
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,420
I can only do nothing

545
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,620
and let Zhao Ji frame me again.

546
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,820
The Sun's words

547
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,220
are just to show gratitude to the sick.

548
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,020
But I've already experienced the court's pressure.

549
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,620
And I was imprisoned.

550
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
My body is already badly injured.

551
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,620
It's really hard to bear this burden.

552
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,020
But you've seen

553
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,420
my cousin's skills just now.

554
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,420
I believe you can use Yuan Lu and their lives

555
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,820
to threaten me.

556
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,620
But I can promise you

557
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
that before they are killed,

558
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,620
I will also send you to the country to make a few more boarding.

559
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,820
Really?

560
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,620
I certainly believe you.

561
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,220
And I also believe that you are not being threatened.

562
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,620
But Lord Ning,

563
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,420
what if this matter is related to the life of Princess Ying?

564
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,020
I agree to our country's heavy capital

565
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,620
to redeem the Emperor.

566
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,020
But the requirement is to use the prince as a hostage.

567
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,220
You know that.

568
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,620
But the King of Yang is in charge of the country,

569
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
and the King of Ying is seriously ill.

570
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,820
So Princess Ying will use her own identity as a prince

571
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,020
to protect the Emperor.

572
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,620
I'm sure that the King of Yang will be able to

573
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,020
use Princess Ying as a hostage.

574
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
At this moment,

575
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,020
she is in the Five Gates of the Emperor.

576
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,420
After a while,

577
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,620
the carriage will arrive at the capital.

578
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,620
Tell me the truth.

579
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
Actually, I

580
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,820
don't care if you can win the Emperor back.

581
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,420
But as long as you safely escort the Princess and see her,

582
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,620
ask her for a decree to pass the decree to the Empress,

583
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,020
and ask her to have her son and daughter as the Empress.

584
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Just ask her to have the decree of my country.

585
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Lord Ning,

586
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,620
if you still want to refuse,

587
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,420
I will let the Princess die now.

588
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Actually,

589
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,820
I don't care who made this dragon chair.

590
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,820
But I will never allow anyone

591
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,020
to challenge my power to control the fire.

592
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,220
Now the Princess's carriage

593
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,220
is passing through the western suburbs of Shan'ao.

594
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,820
As long as I release the name of the Emperor,

595
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,020
the people who ambush will immediately light the fire.

596
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
Lord Ning,

597
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,820
you know that

598
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,820
I have no patience.

599
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Ten.

600
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Nine.

601
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Eight.

602
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
Seven.

603
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Six.

604
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Five.

605
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,820
Six.

606
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,020
The Princess is only sixteen.

607
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,220
What's wrong with her?

608
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,820
You are really patient.

609
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,820
It's nonsense that you didn't get the information of the multiple tests.

610
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
You just said that.

611
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,420
If only you could say one word to me,

612
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
I would believe that you would kill the Princess Ying.

613
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Is it a bit too much?

614
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
But

615
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,220
I believe that you

616
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
will send someone to ambush the Princess.

617
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820
But you just want to fake the fake image of

618
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,820
the Princess and the Princess of Dan Yang.

619
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,220
To be used by you in the future.

620
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,220
Am I right?

621
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,220
Your Highness, please don't panic.

622
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,220
It's just that there are mountain lions and tigers on the mountain road ahead.

623
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Impressive.

624
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,220
You are as good as a pig.

625
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
I feel that

626
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,820
I shouldn't have called in to lead the flow of the flow.

627
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,820
Okay.

628
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,220
If I give up on the demon blood now,

629
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
I will ask you to escort the Princess

630
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,820
and the 100,000 taels of gold

631
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,220
to the safe place as a citizen of the country.

632
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
I will welcome you back.

633
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,220
Are you willing?

634
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,220
Although I, Zhang Song, am a powerful and powerful person,

635
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
I can't bear to report my life to the world.

636
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
Lord Ning,

637
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,820
please consider that for the sake of the people of Tongwei,

638
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,820
I will accept your request.

639
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,820
The people are indeed important.

640
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,420
They are all injured.

641
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,820
It's hard to bear such a heavy burden.

642
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,220
Do you know that

643
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,420
the heavenly Tao that protected His Majesty

644
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,220
and was escorted to the safe place

645
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,820
has been completely destroyed?

646
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,220
You mean, Chai Ming and the others?

647
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,820
Because the war has ended,

648
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,220
the northwestern section has just been broken.

649
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,220
We have received news from the An Du Shao Dian.

650
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,620
The brothers who were escorted by the heavenly Tao

651
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,620
were badly injured.

652
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,820
They have been completely destroyed.

653
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
It's a pity

654
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
that they are not heroes now

655
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,820
but traitors.

656
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,220
This is a nameless note

657
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,620
found in the handbook of the retreat of our army.

658
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,820
Take a look.

659
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
It says

660
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,420
the six Dao Sects have betrayed the country

661
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,420
and killed the emperor.

662
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,820
This

663
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,220
is the report

664
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,420
sent to the court by Hu Zhi Qin today.

665
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,220
It says that the heavenly Tao is important.

666
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,420
The military power is in line with the collusion of the An State.

667
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,420
His Majesty ordered it.

668
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,420
You can tear it down,

669
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,620
but you can't tear the world's

670
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,820
people's minds apart.

671
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,900
Of course, the family of the defeated

672
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:10,220
will take the responsibility of the

673
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,420
retreat by the order of the imperial order.

674
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,820
You are the former vice chief of the six Dao Sects.

675
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Even if you don't care

676
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,020
that your revolution was in vain,

677
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,420
can you still look at it with your eyes open

678
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,620
and take you back from the blood sea

679
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,220
to serve the people of the country?

680
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,620
어

681
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,820
There are no religious세요

682
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,220
while Tang's family is not alive,

683
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,420
so there is no need for them to think about it.

684
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,620
If I am not willing to,

685
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,220
then I can only do one thing.

686
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,940
to prove to the world that

687
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,220
the heavenly law is loyal and brave to brothers.

688
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,060
It's simple to talk to a smart man.

689
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,460
Then you go

690
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,980
or not go?

691
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,220
The End

692
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,220
If I want to finish this book,

693
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,420
I still need more support.

694
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,900
Okay.

695
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,380
I've prepared the book.

696
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,100
From now on,

697
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,900
you'll be promoted to the position of the loyal general

698
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,260
and be the sixth leader of the army.

699
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,540
This is the jade seal that the late emperor gave me.

700
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,660
You can act according to the law.

701
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,460
If you succeed, you'll be severely injured.

702
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,540
If you fail,

703
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
you won't be punished.

704
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,500
I don't have any serious injuries.

705
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,300
But please promise me

706
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,180
that after the mission is completed,

707
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,340
I must let the brothers of the heavenly law

708
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,620
enter the Eagle's Cemetery

709
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,660
and ask the princess to be safe and rich

710
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,020
and let me go back to the mountain.

711
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,660
Yes.

712
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,340
If you fail,

713
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,620
you'll be punished.

714
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,980
Greetings, Prime Minister.

715
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,100
Greetings, Master Tang.

716
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,980
Get up.

717
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,020
It seems that you're really

718
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
expected to be promoted to the position of the loyal general.

719
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,060
Why don't you see Zhao Ji?

720
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,540
Prime Minister,

721
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,820
Lord Zhao went to the capital to arrest the remaining traitors of the Imperial Guards.

722
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,820
He hasn't returned yet.

723
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,740
We have to take care of him grow up.

724
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:37,680
tak

725
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,020
Lord Yin,

726
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,220
you havewing it the six hall as you said,

727
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,540
so you don't have to take care of Zhao Ji.

728
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,300
Thank you, Prime Minister.

729
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,580
Compared to those temporary guards of the heavenly law,

730
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,220
Xia, Xia, Xia, Xia.

731
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,820
Wait.

732
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,420
Young man, are you 18 years old?

733
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,660
You can go if you want.

734
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,340
Your martial arts skills were just average.

735
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,020
Yuan Lu, bring out your dream.

736
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,220
Show it to Xiang Guo.

737
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,260
Don't look at her.

738
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,140
Yuan Lu was a Mo- lace man.

739
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,140
Who are those people?

740
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,380
Prime Minister, please let your guards

741
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,940
deal with me at will.

742
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,300
At will?

743
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,980
You have such a big mouth.

744
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,620
Go.

745
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,740
The four of them are hanging there.

746
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,940
That's right.

747
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,340
The one that Sun Lang is good at is defense.

748
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
Good.

749
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,140
Who are the other two?

750
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,140
There is one

751
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
in the prison.

752
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,340
It's time.

753
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,140
I've never been this beautiful.

754
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,140
Thank you.

755
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
I just knew

756
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
that I could be so beautiful.

757
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,140
I'm sorry.

758
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,140
I'm sorry.

759
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,140
I have to go.

760
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,140
I'm sorry.

761
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,140
I have to go.

762
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,140
I'm sorry.

763
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
I have to go.

764
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,140
I have to go.

765
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,140
How can you be so beautiful?

766
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,140
Why do you have to be modest?

767
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,140
To make the world beautiful

768
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,140
I, Yu Shisan

769
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,140
will live up to my wish

770
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,140
Shisan, someone is coming to see you out

771
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,140
Brother Shisan

772
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,140
Brother Shisan

773
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,140
Brother Shisan

774
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,140
Without you

775
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,140
How can I live?

776
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,140
Brother Shisan, don't go

777
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,140
I can't bear to leave you

778
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,140
Don't go

779
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,140
I can't bear to leave you

780
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Let's go

781
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
I'm leaving again

782
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,140
Goodbye

783
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,140
Brother Shisan, don't go

784
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,140
For the beauty, I'm proud

785
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,140
Even though there are thousands of people, I'm not afraid

786
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,140
Give it to me

787
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,140
Give it to me

788
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,140
Give it to me

789
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,140
Give it to me

790
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,140
Do you have a life-or-death matter to do?

791
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,140
If you are willing

792
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,140
The matter of taking away the gold of Minister Liu's daughter will be settled

793
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
Just do it with others

794
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
You do it with Ning Tong

795
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,140
I'm willing to consider

796
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,140
Tell me what job

797
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,140
Escort a

798
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,140
Zheng Zhi Fang Ling

799
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,140
Fang Ling

800
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,140
Louruo

801
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Louruo

802
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,140
I'm willing to go far away

803
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,140
Princess

804
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,140
I'll do it

805
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,140
Wait

806
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,140
Wait for me

807
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,140
Wait for me

808
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,140
Commandant Qian, the empress is calling you

809
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,140
Commandant Qian

810
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,140
Greetings, Your Highness

811
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,140
Commandant Qian is here

812
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Please rise

813
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,140
These days

814
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,140
I'm worried about the emperor's ransom

815
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,140
The treasury needs to be empty

816
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,140
I'm going to sell the paintings

817
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,140
That the treasury has

818
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,140
But I can't tell which one is the original

819
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,140
The original

820
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
This is the seal

821
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,140
The seal is always in need

822
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,140
It's always in need

823
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,140
It's the imitation of the five immortals' disciples

824
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,140
The imitation of the five immortals' disciples

825
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,140
What is always in need

826
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,140
It's always in need

827
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,140
Please excuse me

828
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,140
Please excuse me

829
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,140
The previous move

830
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Is the old move of the six Taoist churches

831
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
Welcome to the guard

832
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,140
To be transferred to the army

833
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,140
Your Highness

834
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,140
This is

835
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,140
The imitation of the five immortals' disciples

836
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,140
Commandant Qian

837
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,140
You are really a master of both martial arts and martial arts

838
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,140
If it weren't for Prime Minister Zhang's invitation

839
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,140
I really can't bear to leave

840
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,140
Your Highness

841
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,140
Commandant Qian

842
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,140
You are the most trusted guard of His Majesty

843
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,140
When His Majesty went on a expedition

844
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,140
I ordered you to guard the Empress

845
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,140
Now His Majesty is a minister

846
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,140
Are you willing to return to the six Taoist churches

847
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,140
With Tanggu Ning

848
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,140
Willing to help the Emperor

849
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,140
To save the country

850
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,140
I have this intention

851
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,140
I will not fail

852
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,140
The horse has been ready

853
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,140
You should set out as soon as possible

854
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,140
Okay

855
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,140
We will set out tomorrow morning

856
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,140
But after we leave

857
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,140
Please keep an eye on Prince of Danyang

858
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,140
If he does something wrong

859
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,140
We will be defeated

860
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,140
Don't worry

861
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,140
I will try my best

862
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,140
But it's about the position

863
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,140
I will be the first one to go

864
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,140
I will be the first one to go

865
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,140
But it's about the position

866
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,140
He will definitely do something

867
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,140
You guys

868
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
You should pay more attention

869
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,140
Okay

870
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,140
When we leave the capital

871
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,140
I will not come to see you off

872
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,140
I hope

873
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,140
You will return safely

874
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,140
See you again

875
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,140
Please

876
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,140
Don't worry

877
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,140
By the way

878
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,140
In the group

879
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,140
Is there a cousin like you

880
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,140
Who is as beautiful as a flower

881
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
No

882
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,140
Okay

883
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,140
I have known you for more than 20 years

884
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,140
Why have I never heard of you having a cousin

885
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,140
What

886
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,140
You don't know too much

887
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,140
Don't you worry

888
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,140
That Ning Yuanzhou

889
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,140
Will turn against you

890
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,140
As long as you take the princess

891
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,140
And the gold is 100,000 taels

892
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,140
He can find a place to recruit soldiers

893
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,140
And he will be a good thief

894
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,140
I think

895
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,140
It's better to keep his cousin

896
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,140
As hostage

897
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,180
You are more ruthless than Zhao Ji.

898
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,180
How dare you keep it?

899
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,180
Don't worry.

900
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,180
Just now in the pavilion,

901
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,180
didn't you see Ning Yuanzhou

902
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,180
drinking all that tea?

903
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,180
In that tea?

904
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,180
This is a secret medicine from the previous dynasty.

905
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,180
It's called Yi Xun Qian Ji.

906
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,180
If you travel in secret,

907
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,180
you must use this medicine.

908
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,180
You must take the antidote every ten days.

909
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,180
Otherwise,

910
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,180
you will be killed.

911
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,180
I have sent people

912
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,180
to arrange the antidote everywhere.

913
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,180
If he wants to be free,

914
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,180
but Ning Yuanzhou is a smart man.

915
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,180
He knows how to make me feel at ease.

916
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
So,

917
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,180
I gave him that jade tally

918
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,180
and let him feel at ease.

919
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,180
Six Taoist Monastery, hell is here.

920
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,180
Ning Yuanzhou.

921
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,180
Six Taoist Monastery, heaven is here.

922
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,180
Qian Zhao.

923
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,180
Six Taoist Monastery, Asura is here.

924
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,180
Yun Shisan.

925
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,180
Asura is here.

926
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,180
Asura is here.

927
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,220
Yun Shisan.

928
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,220
Six Taoist Monastery, hell is here.

929
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,220
Yuan Lu.

930
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,220
Six Taoist Monastery, heaven is here.

931
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,220
Sun Lang.

932
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,220
Sun Lang.

933
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,220
Sun Lang.

934
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
Sun Lang.

935
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,220
Sun Lang.

936
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,220
Sun Lang.

937
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,220
Sun Lang.

938
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,220
Sun Lang.

939
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,220
Sun Lang.
