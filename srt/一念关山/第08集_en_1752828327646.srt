00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
atkudie

2
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm good.

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,880
And it's what σε

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:52,800
Lu

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,680
Look at me,

6
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
陽明

7
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
You must be чтобы

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
ZhuoACE

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,640
is the biggest temptation I've ever encountered.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hurry!

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,040
General, slow down!

12
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,760
The soldiers behind us can't keep up!

13
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,920
Even if they run away, they can't catch up with me!

14
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,320
I'd rather be with this bastard

15
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,520
than play with me all day!

16
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Go!

17
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Yes!

18
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,000
How long will it take to get to Suzhou?

19
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
The speed of the car is about 20 miles per hour.

20
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,520
We're about 180 miles from Suzhou.

21
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,600
The fastest is two hours.

22
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,040
When Xing was leaving,

23
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,840
Zhou Jian had already passed the 18-mile shop.

24
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
That means

25
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,280
we still have an hour to go.

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,920
We'll be caught up.

27
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,040
We can't avoid this tough battle.

28
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Yan Luo,

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,720
I'll lend you two tear gas bombs.

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We have an hour to go.

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
Thank you.

32
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Sun Na,

33
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
find a suitable place to sit.

34
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,760
We're not going to Suzhou.

35
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,480
We're going to Tianxing Pavilion.

36
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Zhou Jian and his men are thousands of people.

37
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Besides Princess and Lord Du,

38
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
there are also some people who don't know martial arts.

39
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,960
There are only 60 people who can do it.

40
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
So as long as we split up,

41
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,960
they'll chase us separately.

42
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,960
I came here with Yi Fu 10 years ago.

43
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,560
It's 300 steps long,

44
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,760
but the shortest is only two steps.

45
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,960
We can only pass through the four horses.

46
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,760
So as long as we squeeze out the snake's talisman,

47
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,360
we can stop Zhou Jian's snake team.

48
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,360
It's not impossible to win more or less.

49
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,560
I can lead a team to lure them away.

50
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
I brought some traps.

51
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Boss, I can arrange it in the cave.

52
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,040
Okay.

53
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
I'll protect you.

54
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,240
60 people against 500 people.

55
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,040
At least half of them are dead.

56
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,440
Why are you willing to let your men get hurt this time?

57
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
As the leader of the Hall,

58
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,360
it's because of the fact that they can't avoid being killed.

59
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
It makes their death more valuable.

60
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
And only by winning this battle

61
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,040
can we make Lord Dan Yang

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
not be able to give the stone altar a case in a short time.

63
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
What do you need me to do?

64
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,640
Meiren, you're from Chu after all.

65
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,240
It's okay to help the assassins.

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,960
But this is a real knife in our Wu State.

67
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,640
There will be a big battle in a while.

68
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,760
In case the sword doesn't work...

69
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,760
You said we're partners.

70
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,840
Okay.

71
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,760
You'll be in charge of assassinating.

72
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,240
The target is Zhou Jian.

73
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,040
Let me help you.

74
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,840
Okay.

75
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
Be careful.

76
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
Be careful.

77
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,440
Brother, this is enough.

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,640
Is this enough?

79
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,440
It's enough.

80
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,240
It's okay.

81
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,640
It's okay.

82
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,040
It's okay.

83
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,640
Come here.

84
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,640
Tao.

85
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,240
Okay.

86
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,640
Wait a minute.

87
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,040
No, I'm not leaving.

88
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,640
Your Highness.

89
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,360
Alert...

90
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,640
Minster Ning,

91
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't want to leave first with Jaguar Guizheng放行

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,160
beforeoby.

93
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
I want to stay

94
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,240
and live together with everyone.

95
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,040
Listen carefully.

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
Our duty is to protect you and Jaguar Guizheng

97
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,440
and stay safe in the state.

98
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,240
We are at an optimal time.

99
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,600
If we chaos the 여인ımız

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,640
what will happen to Wushuang's secret?

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
All our men

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,080
to protect you and Mr. Du

103
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
from the security of the country.

104
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,920
But I'm the leader of this delegation.

105
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,040
If I leave you

106
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
and escape by myself,

107
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,160
what will happen?

108
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,600
Besides,

109
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,200
I won't say anything.

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,520
If anything happens to you,

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,720
can you guarantee that

112
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,960
Mr. Du and I

113
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,040
will be safe and sound

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,160
in the country alone?

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Brother Yuanzhou,

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
you always told me

117
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
to be brave

118
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,480
and to take the responsibility.

119
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,240
I finally

120
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
don't have to be afraid to die this time.

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Just let me be with everyone.

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,800
He's right.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,840
You have your duty.

124
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,240
He has the responsibility

125
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,480
of being the king.

126
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,160
Whoever let him see the big scene

127
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
will be calmer after he arrives in the country.

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,640
Okay.

129
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,640
Then you be careful.

130
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,760
Yes.

131
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,440
Tianzhao.

132
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,480
Yes.

133
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,640
You take charge of the middle road.

134
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,280
Okay.

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,600
Ding Hui.

136
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,280
Yes.

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Later,

138
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,600
you take Prince Li and Mr. Du

139
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
to the place behind the valley

140
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,280
where it's safe.

141
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Yes.

142
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Take this.

143
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Someone wants to hurt you.

144
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Do it here.

145
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
I'm not merciful.

146
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm not merciful.

147
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Where is Yu Shisan?

148
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,880
It's half past midnight

149
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,920
and he's already late.

150
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,320
I just

151
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,480
prepared some cold medicine

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,280
and let him

153
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,600
put it in the pond by the crossroad.

154
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,400
The army has come a long way

155
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
and must be exhausted.

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,040
When they are waiting at the crossroad,

157
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,800
they will be excited to see the water source.

158
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,720
They are all innocent.

159
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
I won't poison them.

160
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
But at least,

161
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,680
I can make them suffer.

162
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,280
Report.

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Report, General.

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
There's a tiger in front.

165
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
Half an hour ago,

166
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,840
he saw dozens of people

167
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,280
passing by with a four-wheeled carriage.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,720
entiría

169
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Line up.

170
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,320
Envi audio

171
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,440
General,

172
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,400
Prince Li gets Navy anyway.

173
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,400
If someone gets a road

174
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
The road to Tianxing Xia is obviously more difficult.

175
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
They should be divided into two roads.

176
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,800
One road leads to King Li, the other road leads to Jinzi.

177
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,400
Once we get out of Tianxing Xia, we'll meet up at Liu's town in Lingzhou.

178
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,200
General, which side should we go after?

179
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,800
Ning Yuanzhou is very scheming.

180
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
He knows that I won't let him off.

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
I won't let off his King Li either.

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
He's deliberately making me turn left.

183
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
I order you to take 300 people to the left.

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
The remaining 700 people will follow me to Tianxing Xia.

185
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes. Let's go!

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Let's start.

187
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Yes.

188
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
King Li's carriage is right there!

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Chase!

190
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
There's an ambush!

191
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,200
Stop! Let's surrender!

192
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Let's surrender!

193
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
My stomach hurts! There's oil in the water!

194
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,800
My stomach hurts!

195
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't panic!

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Have you forgotten your military discipline?

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Keep going!

198
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Bai Lingcheng, stop!

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,800
Hurry!

200
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,600
Hurry!

201
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Hurry!

202
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,800
Why?

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,200
Hurry up, Duan attendant!

204
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:22,400
Save me!

205
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's send it to them!

206
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
Yes.

207
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Let's go!

208
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:44,760
Thats Braindead

209
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,480
Get out!

210
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,760
Notm's

211
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,240
Protecting the General

212
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,680
Arrest the General

213
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
Take a step!

214
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,360
Really?

215
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,320
Get me a hair.

216
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,240
Its against the как.

217
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,460
Just a few stabs and my enemy's shape will be just fine.

218
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,500
Just put down and只是 swallow it.

219
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Can I just Это with my sword?

220
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
I can just do it in good health.

221
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,020
I just want to put down.

222
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,480
I just wanna food.

223
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,620
I need the talent to open.

224
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,440
You...

225
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm so...

226
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
Building.

227
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm here to intelligence.

228
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,060
Royal이야.

229
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,700
Go.

230
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,220
Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,400
Victorious.

232
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,460
No.

233
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,440
Your Highness!

234
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Your Highness!

235
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm so scared.

236
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm so scared.

237
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Your Highness, Your Highness.

238
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Your Highness.

239
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Lord Gu.

240
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Why do you know this?

241
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
The six of the men have the same power.

242
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
I was once a scholar at Yanxi.

243
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Your Highness.

244
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
How could Lord Dan Yan be so lonely?

245
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
He forced me to be an official.

246
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
I don't know how to be a person.

247
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Everyone, listen to my order.

248
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
The defense is in formation.

249
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Step back slowly.

250
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Step back.

251
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Step back.

252
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Step back.

253
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
The new bandit goes first.

254
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
One.

255
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Kill.

256
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Stop them.

257
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Kill.

258
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Kill.

259
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Stop them.

260
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Don't panic.

261
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
The defense of the Sword is too dense.

262
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
I can't get through.

263
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
At least 300 of them are still alive.

264
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I'll go over there.

265
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Go.

266
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I'll let the wind blow in the future.

267
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,400
The burning sky will never be wrong.

268
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Can you hold on?

269
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
I can.

270
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
You shoot three.

271
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
You shoot three.

272
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
You shoot these bastards.

273
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Will never be wrong.

274
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Watch out.

275
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
I'm going to kill him.

276
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
You go.

277
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I'll go.

278
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
You go.

279
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I'm going to kill him.

280
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
You go.

281
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I'll go.

282
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
I'll go.

283
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I'll go.

284
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
I'll go.

285
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I'll go.

286
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I'll go.

287
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
I'll go.

288
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I'll go.

289
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
You're back.

290
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Can you come back later?

291
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
The most handsome young man

292
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
will come later.

293
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Come.

294
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Shoot the arrow.

295
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,700
General Yuan�

296
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,340
The round arrow has shot off

297
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,340
the last arrow.

298
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,420
You shoot them!

299
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
Zero-vocal.

300
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,360
So double!

301
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,160
General Yuan

302
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,660
Definitely earn a lot now.

303
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,400
Keep these eight federal county invite disciples.

304
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,340
Don't want quite torn apart as a struggle and滔saxmen suggest.

305
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,440
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
I'll kill you.

307
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I'll go from above.

308
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
You'll be the one to be the instigator.

309
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Throw me out with your strength.

310
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
No.

311
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Someone is in the middle of the hole.

312
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
I can't avoid the sword.

313
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
You're the one to be the instigator.

314
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
You're so much heavier than me.

315
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
I can't even get over you.

316
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
No.

317
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
This is our Wu State's business.

318
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
You don't have to risk your life for it.

319
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
This is the most effective way.

320
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
But this is not the best way.

321
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
And you promised me

322
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
to listen to me.

323
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
If you let me go,

324
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
I won't let you have a baby with me.

325
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
I'll go.

326
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Wu Qing, you're so persistent.

327
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
You're not afraid of the future.

328
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,440
You and I are in the same dream.

329
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,440
A little bit of spring, a little bit of autumn,

330
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,440
a little bit of winter, a little bit of winter.

331
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,440
The wind blows the snow, the river flows.

332
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Love is so bitter.

333
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Love is so bitter.

334
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,440
I can't bear it anymore.

335
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,440
I'm in the same dream as you.

336
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Prince Ling, you're under the order of the devil.

337
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
You're a traitor.

338
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
You're under the order of the devil.

339
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
Put down your weapons.

340
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
You can't be punished.

341
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,440
What's wrong with him?

342
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Prince Dorgon has won.

343
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,440
We'reее

344
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Yes.

345
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
We won.

346
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,440
We win.

347
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
We win!

348
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
We win!

349
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,440
We win!

350
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
We win!

351
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
We win!

352
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,440
We won!

353
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,440
We won!

354
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:39,440
We won!

355
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,440
We won!

356
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,440
We won!

357
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Yue Luo!

358
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Yue Luo!

359
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Hold on.

360
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Hold on.

361
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
Hold on.

362
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Hold on.

363
00:27:51,440 --> 00:28:07,440
It's okay.

364
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,440
Be careful.

365
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Tao, the light is back.

366
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
This is the closest place to the star of Spirit Sky.

367
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,360
We have already

368
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,520
reported to the governor.

369
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,760
At most, within an hour,

370
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,600
there will be someone.

371
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,640
The governor of Lingzhou is Zhang Song's student.

372
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
This is his address.

373
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
You can also introduce him to me.

374
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,720
Okay.

375
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,280
Zhu Yiwei's scale is quite large.

376
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,880
Ask the people of the delegation

377
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,920
to move to the west.

378
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,680
I understand. I'll arrange it.

379
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,840
What's wrong with Yuan Lu?

380
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,520
He has been mentally unstable since he was a child.

381
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,000
He can't be too excited or too tired.

382
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,680
The candies he usually eats

383
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,760
are actually pills.

384
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,360
That's why

385
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,000
everyone takes good care of him.

386
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Can't we find a good doctor

387
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
to cure him completely?

388
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The doctor said

389
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,880
we have to wait until he is over 20.

390
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
That means

391
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,160
he might not be able to live to be 20.

392
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,440
Why isn't he worried at all?

393
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,640
He is not not worried.

394
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,440
He is too worried.

395
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,600
That's why he doesn't dare to look or ask.

396
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,600
He just pretends that nothing has happened.

397
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,240
He just hopes that when he turns around,

398
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Yuan Lu can stop like last time.

399
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,240
You know them.

400
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
But I don't know you very well.

401
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,760
Why were you so desperate just now?

402
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,600
I just wanted to try

403
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,720
the feeling you told me last night.

404
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,960
I wanted to feel

405
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,560
that there is a person behind me

406
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,320
who can entrust me with everything

407
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
and everything.

408
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
What kind of feeling is that?

409
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
How did you feel?

410
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
It was a bit troublesome.

411
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,720
But it was much more refreshing

412
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
to do it by myself.

413
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,480
But you disobeyed my order

414
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
and acted on your own.

415
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,280
The crickets are too noisy.

416
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,360
The wound hurts again.

417
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,400
I can't hear you clearly.

418
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,440
Where did you get hurt?

419
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
I was hurt by a mountain.

420
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,760
Your arm is also hurt.

421
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,560
My arm is fine.

422
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,360
Mr. Ning.

423
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,080
Mr. Du.

424
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,760
Find Qian Zhao to get the medicine first.

425
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
I'll come to see you later.

426
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,880
Mr. Du, I was just looking for you.

427
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,160
The governor of Lingzhou will be here soon.

428
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
I'll be waiting for you.

429
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
I'll be waiting for you.

430
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I'll be waiting for you.

431
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,960
I need you to take the crown prince's place.

432
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,360
Me?

433
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,160
Yes.

434
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,280
Brother Yuan Zhou asked me to be sick.

435
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,760
He didn't allow the governor of Lingzhou to come to visit.

436
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,360
Is he afraid that I'll show my flaws?

437
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,040
It's the first time you've seen so many dead bodies.

438
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,760
He's afraid that you'll be emotionally unstable.

439
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,680
I'm useless.

440
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,120
Can Yuan Lu

441
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,680
get through this?

442
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,880
Let's see if God will open his eyes.

443
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,080
Sister Ru Yi.

444
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,360
Can you teach me how to kill?

445
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,280
I don't want anyone to be hurt

446
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,480
and die for me.

447
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,680
You can't go out of this circle

448
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,280
for 300 times.

449
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,480
You'll know it after you're done.

450
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Qian, is it that hard to find the medicine?

451
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,880
I can find it.

452
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,480
I'll go.

453
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:38,880
I'll go.

454
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,680
Find a way.

455
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,680
You'll definitely find it.

456
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,960
What's going on?

457
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,080
Yuan Lu's injury suddenly got worse.

458
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,960
He has a high fever.

459
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,760
Qian said

460
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,760
we must find the snake gallbladder as a medicine.

461
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,880
Isn't the governor of Lingzhou

462
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,280
talking to you in the west yard?

463
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
Tell him to send someone to find it.

464
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,480
No.

465
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
We need the snake gallbladder.

466
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,560
How many times do we need to do this?

467
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
Besides, can we only use the snake gallbladder?

468
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,960
And what does the snake look like?

469
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,560
Yes.

470
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,920
What does the snake look like?

471
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,560
Enough.

472
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,560
I don't even know what the snake looks like.

473
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,280
Ask the people in the inn.

474
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,080
I've asked.

475
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,360
There's a Qingjing Mountain in the west of the temple.

476
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,880
And the sand and river ditch in the north.

477
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,160
Someone has seen this snake.

478
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,480
Qingjing Mountain?

479
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,480
Qingjing Mountain?

480
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,080
Lingzhou?

481
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,680
I'll go to Qingjing Mountain.

482
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,360
I'll go with you.

483
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,760
Ding Hui, go to the sand and river ditch.

484
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,360
Yes.

485
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Qian, let's go.

486
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,680
Beauty.

487
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,760
The way to the mountain is over there.

488
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,680
You're not wrong.

489
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,080
In the valley of Qingjing Mountain,

490
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,160
there's a snake near the stream.

491
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,400
Someone told me about it.

492
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,080
Really?

493
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
Don't worry, Mr. Du.

494
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,600
I'll send a letter

495
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,120
to suppress the Zhou Empire.

496
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,680
With you as the leader,

497
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,080
the Danyao network

498
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
will not be defeated.

499
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,080
In that case,

500
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,880
thank you, sir.

501
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,320
Please wait.

502
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,240
So you take this?

503
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,600
There will be millions of kaçens

504
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,840
arriving in the future.

505
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,600
Hope

506
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,480
it won't happen again today.

507
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,920
I can't tell you.

508
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,400
Now His Majesty is in jail.

509
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,040
Many people are enrolling into his side.

510
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,240
So today,

511
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,800
I'll stone the whole world

512
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,560
and kill all the Marquis Jin,

513
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,760
please let those

514
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,440
who server ill people

515
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,720
put their heads

516
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,360
I'm sorry.

517
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,560
I thought that the Daoshan Fire Sea

518
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
was the place of peace.

519
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,280
But I didn't expect

520
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,760
that it's already in the Great Wujing.

521
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Mr. Du, don't worry.

522
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,680
With our Six Halls,

523
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,400
we will definitely protect His Highness.

524
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,320
Thank you.

525
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,440
Blood?

526
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,600
Mr. Ye, you're hurt.

527
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,240
It's okay.

528
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,040
I'll bandage myself.

529
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,240
You've worked hard all day.

530
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,080
Have an early rest.

531
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,160
I'll go and check the way out.

532
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,440
Don't worry.

533
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,880
Okay.

534
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
I used the Lingyang Legs to press the heat.

535
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,640
But if I can't find the one-way way,

536
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,360
I can't hold out till tonight.

537
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,600
Did you send someone to find it?

538
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,920
I went to all the places I could.

539
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
I hope they can find it.

540
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,480
By the way,

541
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,520
how's Miss Ren's injury?

542
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,360
She's injured.

543
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,120
Where is she?

544
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,760
She went to Qingqing Mountain with Shisan.

545
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,880
I'm enough here.

546
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:36,160
You don't need to

547
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,340
I'll be watching right in front of you.

548
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,560
mistakes

549
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:32,300
The

550
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
You were a human juxtaposition

551
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:49,160
of the three

552
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,900
Correct

553
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,700
추천

554
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,800
After you

555
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,640
At that time

556
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,660
Was the countdown

557
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,280
Please

558
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,040
Let's go.

559
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,040
Go.

560
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
Oh, no. It's almost dawn.

561
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,520
The snake won't come out during the day.

562
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,120
If we're not there in time,

563
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,040
I'm afraid that...

564
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,640
Why don't we catch some rats

565
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,360
and cut them into pieces?

566
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
The snake might get used to

567
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,760
the smell of blood.

568
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,720
Okay.

569
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,960
I'll reply to your letter for the next few days.

570
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,120
We're going to catch the 그렇es!

571
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,240
You sing g southwest of the мин지 wand.

572
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,220
Bastard, why had you run away on high promotion?

573
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,320
I didn't have any rights to lead the reduction team.

574
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,000
Am I a fool for running away?

575
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,080
Save the ups and downs in the life.

576
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,920
Look at how Couple with you.

577
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,320
He's just an unrivaled input about me

578
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
that has become increases.

579
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,600
Work well from now on.

580
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,040
Bastard.

581
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,600
off the

582
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,020
crossword,

583
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,800
We must not be looking for mice.

584
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,760
I'll make a run after her.

585
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,360
He seems pretty confident,

586
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,120
right?

587
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:58,880
เพ shrinking

588
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Be careful.

589
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Are you okay?

590
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I'm fine.

591
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,720
Snake is fine.

592
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,520
It's alive.

593
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
It's very strong.

594
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
The wound is cracked.

595
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I've dragged my arm for a long time.

596
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,520
It's okay.

597
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
Ning.

598
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,720
Meiren's horse and I ran away.

599
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,320
I'm in a hurry to send the body back.

600
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,920
I can only take your horse away.

601
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Meiren and you

602
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,320
will get better soon.

603
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,320
Don't worry.

604
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,120
How can you be in a hurry to get better?

605
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,920
Don't worry.

606
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,520
Yu Shisan.

607
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,320
Bear with it.

608
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
You know how to ride a horse.

609
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Can you move?

610
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes.

611
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
I'll go to the hospital.

612
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
I'll go to the hospital.

613
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Okay.

614
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Okay.

615
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,120
Then help me look at the wound.

616
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Help me look at it.

617
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Take a deep breath.

618
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Does it hurt?

619
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Yes.

620
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,920
Come on. Take a deep breath.

621
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Does it hurt here?

622
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
It's okay.

623
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,520
Put on your clothes.

624
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,120
The impact of the river

625
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
is not serious.

626
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,320
It's just a former injury.

627
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,720
I'll bandage it for you when we get back.

628
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
No need.

629
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,320
It's more inconvenient.

630
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
What's wrong with you?

631
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Nothing.

632
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,720
You're embarrassed.

633
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,920
If I knew you would eat this,

634
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,320
I should learn from those guards

635
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,320
and take a bath in front of you.

636
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,320
Don't do this in front of others.

637
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,320
You're a girl after all.

638
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,720
Killers don't distinguish between men and women.

639
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,120
Only the dead and the living.

640
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
It's almost dawn.

641
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
Let's go.

642
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,520
How do you know there are snakes in Qingjing Mountain?

643
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,920
Your Highness taught me to read books.

644
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,920
There's a book called

645
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,320
The Book of Qingjing Mountain.

646
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,720
It says

647
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,320
there are poisonous snakes here.

648
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,320
But I didn't expect

649
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,120
the spiritual boat in the book

650
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
is here.

651
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,720
Your Highness is really nice to you.

652
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Of course.

653
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,320
She not only taught me to read books,

654
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,120
she also bought me a house.

655
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,720
She said even if I don't often go to the capital,

656
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,520
as long as I'm a girl,

657
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,320
I have to have my own room.

658
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
What's wrong?

659
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,920
The Book of Qingjing Mountain.

660
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,720
You haven't got the antidote yet.

661
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,520
I can still hear it even though it's my first time.

662
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,520
I'll use my inner power to suppress it.

663
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,920
Your inner power is half of the power.

664
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,920
Shut up.

665
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
I suddenly can't open my eyes.

666
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,720
Every turn

667
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,720
has a reason.

668
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,720
The red dust is like my heart.

669
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
It's beating differently.

670
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,720
It's been a long time.

671
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,720
I can never forget theley's appearance.

672
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
The person under my eyes

673
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,720
is also the king of Qinguccans.

674
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Yes.

675
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,720
It's theiges of the emperor.

676
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,720
Yes.

677
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,720
One flower will grow on it.

678
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,720
But the ISC doesn't want to grow on the king's tree.

679
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Will my eyes

680
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,720
mix up with your eyes?

681
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,340
Society is now

682
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,520
ery in the April Cooling Ceremony.

683
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,720
Even if one should not wait in there,

684
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,620
All lives are young

685
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,640
I don't know who I like

686
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,220
Only you know

687
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,480
I have been Fact-checked

688
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,080
I once lost myself

689
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,280
Incense picking

690
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,720
Letter writing

691
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,140
Like embroidery

692
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,640
Ning Yanzhou

693
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,800
Did you see that

694
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,240
The empress is right

695
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,280
theatre

696
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,280
I'll let go of the only one

697
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,080
Is your poison really okay?

698
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,080
It's okay now

699
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,600
And Zhang Song's people know that I'm here

700
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,200
I'll send it tonight

701
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,120
That's good

702
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,640
You

703
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,200
Wait a minute

704
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,600
You have this on your head

705
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
Don't be so alert

706
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,720
I think you're getting more and more careful

707
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,720
Want to care

708
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,160
Moreover

709
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,360
Didn't the love-hunt yesterday promise you?

710
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,760
As long as you send me to kill Zhou Jian

711
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,880
I won't force you and me to have children anymore

712
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
I'm a man of my word

713
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,120
Why are you suddenly

714
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,160
Look at your sweet words

715
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,680
You're right

716
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,840
There are more good men in the world

717
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,120
Not only you

718
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,440
How's your road?

719
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,760
I'm awake

720
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,840
I saved a life

721
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,000
I'll have a look

722
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,080
What are you doing?

723
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,960
I heard your voice coming out

724
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,880
I didn't expect that other than Lao Yu's story

725
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,120
I saw another good show

726
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,400
I have to go

727
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,760
My cousin used to trouble you

728
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,320
I suddenly don't want you right now

729
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,600
Are you not comfortable?

730
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,280
Ruyi

731
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,000
ämän

732
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,080
Thank you

733
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,880
I'm just returning the favor I borrowed from you.

734
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,240
Rest well.

735
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,240
This is for you.
