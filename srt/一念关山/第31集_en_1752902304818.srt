How is it?

13
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hold your hand

14
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you

15
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There is still one last step

16
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you doing?

17
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Nothing

18
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Send people to build the city together

19
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This sword will accompany you like me

20
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Accompany you to travel the world

21
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Accompany you to travel the world

22
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Name it

23
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hong Chen

24
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hong Chen has you

25
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hong Chen also has me

26
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hong Chen bill games

27
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hong Chen bill games

28
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
toca

29
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
I canẻ kald

30
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
Hong Chen bill games

31
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
my Women是啊

32
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,000
let's coaxing

33
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
are popular

34
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
are popular

35
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
You gave it to her gradually

36
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,800
I, Yu Shisan

37
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm good at all kinds of tricks

38
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,560
But this time

39
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
I really admire you

40
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,120
Use blood to build a bridge

41
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,960
High

42
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
If I were a girl

43
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,760
My heart would be a pool of spring water

44
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440
But don't play too much

45
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,920
The war is coming

46
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
Make such a big hole

47
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,040
Nothing

48
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,440
Just a scratch

49
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,600
But it doesn't make sense

50
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
With your previous cautious temperament

51
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,200
Before the war

52
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,960
Even the knife has to be rubbed three times in person

53
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,600
How did you take the initiative this time

54
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,880
Hurt your own arm

55
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,360
Shisan

56
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,080
Huang entren

57
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,520
Blood

58
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
She cries

59
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,760
In an instant

60
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:11,280
Always

61
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,400
I

62
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,560
Lao Ning

63
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,720
You.

64
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,160
I'm our inner ninth animal.

65
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,920
Si drug

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,440
has been actingdual for seven days.

67
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
The symbolic means it has been seven days.

68
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,520
Un fish

69
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
Xiao is chewing that they're sick.

70
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,960
But the drug doesn't actually completely remove

71
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
herfull and unexpected uniation.

72
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,400
Now two kinds of drugs are trying to transfer each other.

73
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,000
There is something wrong with his internal force

74
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,680
At this moment

75
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,200
It may directly affect the success of the old emperor

76
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,080
And this time

77
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,280
I can't guarantee that I can come back alive

78
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Not really

79
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,760
What if the problem is not solved on the day of action?

80
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,160
Let's do things in the six hall

81
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,760
When to rely on luck

82
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,480
What about this matter

83
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,200
Don't let anyone know

84
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,720
In case of disorder

85
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,840
If at that time

86
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
What's the matter at that time

87
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,600
You take them out

88
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,560
Don't worry about me

89
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
What the hell are you talking about?

90
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
What's the matter at that time

91
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,200
You listen to me

92
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,000
This road is too small

93
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,400
The former move is too central

94
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,920
So this thing

95
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
I can only leave it to you

96
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
As for the blood photo

97
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,600
If you can't get it

98
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I don't need to save him.

99
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Now, he's growing up.

100
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,800
I believe he will do his best to help Tian Dao brothers.

101
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
If you think I'm your brother,

102
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
promise me to send them out safely.

103
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Don't come.

104
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't leave such a troublesome matter to me.

105
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
If you can, then entrust the beauty to me.

106
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
You can leave now. I will definitely be with her.

107
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Do you think I can't beat you now?

108
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
You're bullying me now.

109
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Then promise me.

110
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Come back to Wuguang safely with me.

111
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I will.

112
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
What is the secret of saving people in Wei?

113
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Commander Ying,

114
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
this is the rule set by the commander in chief Chen in the position of the commanding officer.

115
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
If there is a dispute,

116
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
two people can fight.

117
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
No matter who is alive or dead, no one can interfere.

118
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,400
If there is a violation, the power will be destroyed.

119
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
The god is taking the initiative to challenge you.

120
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm the fourth.

121
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm the third.

122
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm the fourth.

123
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm the fifth.

124
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm the sixth.

125
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm the seventh.

126
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm the eighth.

127
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I'm the ninth.

128
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm the tenth.

129
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm the tenth.

130
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm the tenth.

131
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm the tenth.

132
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
I'm the tenth.

133
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm the tenth.

134
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm the tenth.

135
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I'm the tenth.

136
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Commander Deng,

137
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
you're really brave.

138
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Jing Ru is coming by herself.

139
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
You don't need to be afraid of being surrounded by the people.

140
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,400
You killed the first prince and Wang Guogong.

141
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Yes.

142
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
You avenged the late queen.

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Yes.

144
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480

Come quickly

What's happening?

168

Take it, take it

Too slow

Even a diesel lung is unsuitable

173
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,340
Come down

174
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,340
The sword is made of kite

175
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,340
The paint is the same color as the kite

176
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
The six hall will contact you

177
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
We will try our best to rescue you

178
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
The second one is the one who is the most powerful.

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
The last one is the cat that kills the tree.

230
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
The seven cat is the cat who kills the kitchen swing.

231
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:52,780

What I'm saying is the rules of the Imperial Guards.

238
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,780
I can't obey those old rules of fighting alone.

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Yes

384
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,940
Your Highness, let's go

385
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Where is Du Zhang Shi

386
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,940
He was still there

387
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,940
Help

388
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Bad

389
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
Go

390
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
Lord Du

391
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,940
I'm packing

392
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
If you haven't seen the true man, you can't run away

393
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
You should report to others

394
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,940
Go

395
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
Lord Du

396
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Wake up

397
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,940
Brother Qian

398
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
It's near the lake.

399
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
What should we do?

400
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
No.

401
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
We should go to the hospital immediately.

402
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Otherwise, we can't survive.

403
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Your Highness, the carriage is at the gate.

404
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
The people outside seem to have noticed something.

405
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
They are looking this way.

406
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Slow down.

407
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Be careful.

408
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
Your Highness, let's go.

409
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,020
We should be there in half an hour.

410
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
We should go to the gate and meet with Yuan Zhou and his brother.

411
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
Yes.

412
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm not going.

413
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Your Highness.

414
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
The wounded commander can't be out of the city in half an hour.

415
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
You should take him to the hospital to find a doctor.

416
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Let him treat the wounded commander in the carriage.

417
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
We can't leave you alone.

418
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Is it more important to live or die?

419
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
The wounded commander is so badly injured.

420
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
If he is delayed, he will die.

421
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,100
The people outside have probably noticed something wrong.

422
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Otherwise, how could they send someone to come in?

423
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Their target is me.

424
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,100
If I go out with you, the Imperial Guards will not follow me.

425
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,100
If it affects Yuan Zhou and his brother, everything will be over.

426
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
So I stay here.

427
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
You go first.

428
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Don't worry about me.

429
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
I'm the king of Li after all.

430
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
They won't do anything to me.

431
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,100
It's not worth it to think of a way to save me after you save my brother.

432
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
But I have to send you to...

433
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
Sun Lang.

434
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,100
How dare you disobey my order in person?

435
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I dare not.

436
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,100
The mission of this delegation is to save my brother.

437
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,100
And I am the leader of this delegation.

438
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Now I order you to be punished immediately.

439
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Brother Sun.

440
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,100
You have been protecting me all the way.

441
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Now it's my turn to do something for you.

442
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Go.

443
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Your Highness.

444
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Take care.

445
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Be careful.

446
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,100
What's wrong with Lord Du?

447
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
So much blood.

448
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
He just hit his head.

449
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Send him to the clinic.

450
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Send him to the clinic.

451
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
Stop talking.

452
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,180
We must cure Lord Du.

453
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Hurry up.

454
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
Go.

455
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
I can see clearly.

456
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Du is indeed injured.

457
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Don't worry about them.

458
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Just keep the leader of this delegation.

459
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
Yes.

460
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,260
Go.

461
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Please bless my brother and Ru Yi.

462
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
You can leave the city safely.

463
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,260
Bless Lord Du to be a good brother.

464
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Yuan Lu, Brother Qian, Brother Thirteen and Brother Sun.

465
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
You will be fine.

466
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,260
Bless my brother to return safely.

467
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,260
I, Yang Ying, am willing to suffer for ten years.

468
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
No.

469
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,260
I am willing to suffer for ten years.

470
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,260
I, Yang Ying, am willing to suffer for ten years.

471
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Thirteen, take the car away.

472
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
I will stay and wait.

473
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
Okay.

474
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Don't be afraid, Your Majesty.

475
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
I have this.

476
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
I have this.

477
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Look.

478
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
There are Chen Hou Tou and Ning Yun Zhou.

479
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
What are you afraid of?

480
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
If you are not afraid,

481
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,260
follow me to see the lake and the mountains.

482
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
If you are afraid,

483
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
close your eyes.

484
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
Go.

485
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
Who?

486
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
Go.

487
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Go to the front.

488
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Yes.

489
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Attack.

490
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Attack.

491
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
Attack.

492
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,260
Attack.

493
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Attack.

494
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Catch Prince Qin.

495
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,340
Take him into the water.

496
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Okay.

497
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
Go.

498
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Go.

499
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
Are you okay?

500
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,340
I'm fine.

501
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,340
Go.

502
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,340
No.

503
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
Go.

504
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Your Majesty.

505
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Your Majesty.

506
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Your Majesty.

507
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
Over there.

508
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Hurry.

509
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Over there.

510
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,340
Stop.

511
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Take His Majesty into the car.

512
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,340
Others, leave quickly.

513
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,340
Yes.

514
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,340
Go.

515
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Did you catch the man?

516
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,340
I'm not as good as you.

517
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
From now on,

518
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Your Majesty can be at ease.

519
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,340
Go.

520
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
Kill him.

521
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
Don't.

522
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,340
How dare you kill the evil dragon?

523
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Deng Hui.

524
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,420
How dare you collude with him to kill me?

525
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,420
I have no second thoughts.

526
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,420
He is so stupid.

527
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,420
He doesn't deserve to be with me.

528
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
What do you want to do?

529
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,420
Yuan Xin,

530
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,420
it's a death sentence to kidnap His Majesty.

531
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,420
Do you think you can get out?

532
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,420
Since I dare to come,

533
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
I won't be afraid.

534
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420
You are already confused.

535
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Deng Hui,

536
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
whether it's the doctor or the drug,

537
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
I have to be more familiar with you.

538
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
You lost.

539
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Please.

540
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Please save my sister.

541
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Hurry.

542
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Kneel down.

543
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Shan Hu.

544
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Yes.

545
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I will do my best.

546
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
This sword

547
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,500
is the love token that my lover gave me.

548
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
I haven't tasted the life yet.

549
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Li Si,

550
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,500
do you want to be the first one?

551
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,500
Yuan Xin,

552
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
what do you want?

553
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Do you want to avenge the Empress

554
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
or do you want my gold?

555
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,500
I want

556
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
the peace and happiness.

557
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
I want

558
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
the peace and happiness.

559
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,580
The peace and happiness of the courtiers.

560
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,580
What happened?

561
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Hurry.

562
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Get down.

563
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,580
Yes.

564
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,580
Something happened.

565
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,580
The Imperial Hospital is detaining Prince Li.

566
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
The Imperial Hospital is detaining Prince Li.

567
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,580
Catch them.

568
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,580
Sir.

569
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Sir.

570
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,580
Sir, bad news.

571
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,580
Two famous enemies are in danger.

572
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
Something happened in the palace and Donghu.

573
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,580
General.

574
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,580
The Imperial Guards are in charge of Donghu.

575
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
There is a big event in the court.

576
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,660
Prepare to go back to the court immediately.

577
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,660
Yes.

578
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Have the palace's mechanisms been packed?

579
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,660
They are all hidden.

580
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,660
I will try to see if they can wake up.

581
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,660
Okay.

582
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,660
Tao.

583
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,660
What if it's not written on the body?

584
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,660
Or we can make a snowman.

585
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,660
The handprint and the print are mostly on the hand.

586
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,660
Prepare the snowman first.

587
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,740
The most urgent thing is to wake him up.

588
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,740
He saved you just now.

589
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,740
Okay.

590
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,740
What should we do now?

591
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,740
Do everything according to the original plan.

592
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,740
We have to wait for you to come back.

593
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
Sir.

594
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,740
What's wrong with you?

595
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,820
What's wrong with you?

596
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,820
Where is the Prince?

597
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,820
I am guilty.

598
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,820
I was not careful enough to take care of the Prince.

599
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
What's wrong with you?

600
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,820
Prince Li is still inside.

601
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,900
We are holding it like a metal barrel.

602
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
It has a wing that can't fly out.

603
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,900
Search it.

604
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,900
This way.

605
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,900
This way.

606
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
Prince Li, hurry up.

607
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
Prince Li, hurry up.

608
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,900
Get out of here.

609
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,900
It's on fire.

610
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
It's midnight.

611
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,900
How can it be?

612
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,900
It's on fire.

613
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,900
It's on fire.

614
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Help!

615
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,900
The Imperial Guards set fire at night.

616
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,900
They want to kill me.

617
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,900
The rescuer is punished.

618
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,900
Really?

619
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,900
It's true.

620
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,900
The Imperial Guards are so bad.

621
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,900
They are embarrassing us.

622
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,900
Let's go.

623
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,900
Hurry up.

624
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
Let's go.

The Imperial Guards are so bad.

629
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,900
They are embarrassing us.
