the

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
the

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
the

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,120
the

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,120
the

00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,120
the

00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,120
the

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,120
the

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,120
the

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,240
th

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,240
th

00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,440
th

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,400
The wind and frost are in the air, where is the place to hide?

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,940
The

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,360
wind and frost are in the air, where is the place to hide?

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,240
The clouds are so beautiful.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
The wind and frost are in the air, where is the place to hide?

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,720
The clouds are so beautiful.

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,320
The clouds are so beautiful.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,720
The clouds are so beautiful.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,120
The wind and frost are in the air, where is the place to hide?

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,240
The clouds are so beautiful.

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,080
The clouds are so beautiful.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,280
The clouds are so beautiful.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,080
The clouds are so beautiful.

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,920
The clouds are so beautiful.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,120
It's not a joint effort.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Master, it's really you.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,120
I beg you to forgive me.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Please.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
I can't take care of so much.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
I only want to ask my master.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,120
I only want to ask my master.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
I only want to ask my master.

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Okay.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Follow me.

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Go.

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Go.

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Beauty, don't worry.

41
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Leave it to me.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Calm down.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Let me go.

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Calm down.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Do you feel comfortable without any resistance?

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
I tell you.

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
If it weren't for your master's sake today,

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
I would never let you leave here alive.

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
I hope this is your last time going crazy.

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm not crazy.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
I just don't want to admit defeat.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Why are you doing this to me?

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Why?

54
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Think about what you've done.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
You've hurt His Highness and the six Taoist churches.

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,120
And your evil ways.

57
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
I've told you before.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Stay away from Ruyi.

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
You do like other people's rights.

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,120
But if you disturb her peace and let her down,

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
or hurt the six Taoist churches and His Highness,

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I won't let you suffer.

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
You don't want to give me a safe life.

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't lie to me.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
I just want her to give me another chance.

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Am I wrong?

67
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
You're wrong.

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Do you think everyone in this world should be around you?

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Everything should go your way.

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
You're saying what you want.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Have you ever thought about what Ruyi thinks?

72
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
What does your master think?

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
What kind of person does he need?

74
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I tell you.

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
He needs someone to respect him.

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
He needs someone to love him.

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
He needs a stable partner.

78
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
A man who can stand side by side with him.

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Do you think so?

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
A man is trapped in love.

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,120
The story of love can only appear in the storybook.

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,120
If you go crazy in reality,

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
the lady will only retreat for three lives.

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Do you like to sit on the firework on your way home?

85
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Do you like it?

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
No.

87
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
That's right.

88
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Your master won't like it either.

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
No one likes a person who is emotionally unstable.

90
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
How about it?

91
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm relieved now.

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Why are you telling me this?

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm helping you.

94
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
I hope you can be like a man.

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Don't be like a child crying here every day.

96
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,120
You're just trying to help me.

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
You don't want me to cause trouble for you.

98
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,120
You want to save your master as soon as possible, right?

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Of course.

100
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm not a Buddha.

101
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Why should I help you with the secret scriptures?

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
It's easy for you.

103
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm telling you.

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I'm just using you.

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
I just like to plan.

106
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
And I've made it clear in Hexian.

107
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
I can help you to get to the highest position in Angu.

108
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
But the premise is that you must be in the middle of the circle.

109
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Otherwise, I don't care how deep your relationship with your master is.

110
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,120
I can find someone and help him to get to that position step by step.

111
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
You can decide the rest.

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I'll keep my promise.

113
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,120
And I'll take the opportunity to ask the Emperor to give a speech to His Majesty.

114
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
So that he can let go of Wu Di earlier.

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Sha Xi is the third son of Angu.

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
He's the son of the Emperor.

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I'll help you to get to the highest position in Angu.

118
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
I'll help you to get to the highest position in Angu.

119
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
I'll help you to get to the highest position in Angu.

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
I'll help you to get to the highest position in Angu.

121
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Sha Xi is one of the three tribes of Angu.

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
He's more than I can.

123
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,120
But according to His Majesty's recent thoughts,

124
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
it's not easy to let go of him.

125
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
We'll take action on this.

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
We won't sit and wait.

127
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
The one who's been defending Yongan Tower recently is not my Yulin Guard.

128
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,120
It's Zhu Yiwei of the Shidong Club and Shi Wei of the Sha Zhong Club.

129
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I heard that they've set up a lot of traps in the tower.

130
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
I can't help you with that.

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,120
And that place is not the place where Zhu Yiwei asked for the prisoner.

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Even my master doesn't necessarily know what's going on inside.

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
We'll take care of the attack tower.

134
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
You just need to help us out there.

135
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Besides,

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,120
if I have a way to get rid of the First Prince,

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
are you willing to take part in it?

138
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm willing to hear about it.

139
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
The Queen of Zhaojie has a deep love for Ru Yi.

140
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,120
The First Prince is also the one who caused the Queen of Zhaojie's death.

141
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm willing to take part in it.

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm willing to take part in it.

143
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
The First Prince is also the one who caused the Queen of Zhaojie's death.

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Because he colluded with the city's ghost and wanted to harm you in Hexian,

145
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Ru Yi definitely won't let him off.

146
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
But now,

147
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Ru Yi's injuries are already quite severe.

148
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
I don't want to see him in a daze again.

149
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
My master is injured?

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Impossible.

151
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Listen to what you're saying.

152
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
He's a human, not a puppet.

153
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Of course he'll get hurt.

154
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Then...

155
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
I'll help him.

156
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
I'll arrange for his death.

157
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Your master is the best assassin.

158
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
What kind of death does he need?

159
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
What you need to do now is to make sure he doesn't suspect anything before he takes action,

160
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
and doesn't take revenge after he takes action.

161
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Do you understand?

162
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
If you want to get rid of the First Prince,

163
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
for example,

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
this is the First Prince.

165
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
This is you.

166
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
This is Ru Yi.

167
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
And this is the Second Prince.

168
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
If you want Ru Yi to leave with you,

169
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,120
the only thing we have to do is to take advantage of the situation and use him.

170
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
To get rid of him.

171
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
You mean,

172
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,120
we'll set up a trap to make the Second Prince deal with the First Prince?

173
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
But the Second Prince might not be fooled.

174
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Although he and the First Prince have been fighting for the Crown Prince's position,

175
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
the Second Prince is too timid.

176
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,120
He has been too timid for so many years.

177
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Then we'll force him to do it.

178
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
We'll tell him that the First Prince is now colluding with the State Security.

179
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
He wants to deal with him.

180
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
But the next one is him.

181
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Guess what he'll do after he hears this?

182
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
He won't sit and wait.

183
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
But in this case,

184
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm afraid the Second Prince is also unrepentant.

185
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
I'm afraid he can't take it himself.

186
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,120
The Second Prince is the only bloodline to summon the Empress.

187
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
If I do this,

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
will you be more angry with me?

189
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
I won't.

190
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Master.

191
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,120
The Second Prince's hands are also in the blood of the Empress.

192
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
For the sake of the Empress,

193
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
I won't kill him.

194
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
But I'll also let him pay the price he should pay.

195
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Master.

196
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
But,

197
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
except for the Second Prince,

198
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
there's one more person who forced the Empress to die.

199
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Who is it?

200
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Andi.

201
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,120
He didn't care about the safety of the people and betrayed the Empress.

202
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
So from now on,

203
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I won't call him the Emperor anymore.

204
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Master.

205
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Are you going to kill him?

206
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
No.

207
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
After all, you're still a doctor.

208
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
His death will cause chaos in the country.

209
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
But I will let him pay a more painful price than death.

210
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Brothers are strong,

211
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
two sons are together,

212
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,120
and the name of the defeat is the will of the thousand.

213
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
At that time,

214
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
they will take the opportunity to save the Emperor.

215
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
And then,

216
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
you can become stronger.

217
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Li Tengguang.

218
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Do you dare?

219
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
What the Emperor wishes,

220
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I will do it.

221
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Master.

222
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
If you want to discuss things in the future,

223
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
will you still see me?

224
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Don't worry.

225
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
I will do it properly.

226
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Wait for my good news.

227
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Wait.

228
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
I will wait for you.

229
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
I will wait for you.

230
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
I will wait for you.

231
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
The wound on the neck,

232
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
you can apply it yourself.

233
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
If someone asks,

234
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,120
just say that you were killed by the doctor again.

235
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Thank you, Master.

236
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Do you think that

237
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
we are so many people

238
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
that we go back to the temple together,

239
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
especially wild?

240
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Ning.

241
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
We go first, you wait.

242
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Go.

243
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Only two of us left.

244
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Is it walking or riding?

245
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Let's go back later than them.

246
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Okay?

247
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Okay.

248
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
By the way,

249
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
I suddenly remembered

250
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
that when I came here many years ago,

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
I hid a treasure.

252
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
I don't know if it has been taken away

253
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
for so many years.

254
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
What treasure?

255
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Wait for me.

256
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
This is the treasure I said.

257
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
Guess what it is.

258
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I don't know.

259
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
This is the best work

260
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
of my life.

261
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Look.

262
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
It's a treasure.

263
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
It's a treasure.

264
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
It's a treasure.

265
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
It's a treasure.

266
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
It's a treasure.

267
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
It's really a treasure.

268
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Why is it so light?

269
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Inside here,

270
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
it's made of wood.

271
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
There's a layer of gold outside.

272
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Why do you do that?

273
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
I did this when I came here

274
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
many years ago.

275
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
At that time,

276
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I was still a captain of the Imperial Guard.

277
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
I still remember that we had experienced

278
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,120
a attack of the master of the Imperial Guard.

279
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
You were badly injured.

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
I almost didn't survive.

281
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
So from that day on, I was thinking,

282
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
if one day,

283
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
when I was on a mission,

284
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
I would die like this.

285
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Is there no trace of me

286
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
in this world?

287
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
So I did this.

288
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
I hope that one day,

289
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
someone can dig it up and find it.

290
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
After finding it,

291
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
he would take this gold nail

292
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
to the store to exchange for money.

293
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
But when he went there,

294
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
he knew it was fake.

295
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
He would definitely think

296
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
who did this.

297
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Who would do this?

298
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
In this case,

299
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
at least in the world,

300
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
there would be someone who remembers me.

301
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
He would always think of me.

302
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,120
I had the same thought.

303
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
You thought about it too?

304
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
So you know me.

305
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
We were both

306
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
cruel and ruthless.

307
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
We were both childish.

308
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
We were both

309
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
ungrateful.

310
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Yes, we were.

311
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
But now,

312
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
I am not like this.

313
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
I have the brothers of the six Taoist churches.

314
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
I have you.

315
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Even if I die one day,

316
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
they will remember me.

317
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Of course,

318
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
we will remember you too.

319
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
By the way,

320
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
today,

321
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
when Li Dongguang left,

322
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
did you see his expression

323
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
and get jealous again?

324
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
No.

325
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Now he is a child

326
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
in my eyes.

327
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
I see him as

328
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
a disobedient son.

329
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
You are lying.

330
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I am telling the truth.

331
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I am telling the truth.

332
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
To be honest,

333
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I am a little jealous.

334
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Every time I see him,

335
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
I would be impressed.

336
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
He is so young.

337
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
He could be a

338
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
powerful and powerful official.

339
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
But he is a young man

340
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
who dares to love and hate.

341
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
And he only needs you to smile at him.

342
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
He will change from a madman

343
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
to a calm man.

344
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
He is a man who

345
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
loves you.

346
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
So although he comes

347
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
to trouble me

348
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
over and over again,

349
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
I still can't get over him.

350
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
In fact,

351
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
not only him,

352
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
everyone has a good side.

353
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Including Her Highness.

354
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
Sometimes,

355
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I also

356
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
think about it today.

357
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Her Highness

358
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
is not as perfect as I thought.

359
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Andy is her husband.

360
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
The second prince

361
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
is her 14-year-old son.

362
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
But at the last moment of her life,

363
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
she finally understands

364
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
that she is deceived

365
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
and betrayed by her loved ones.

366
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
So in her eyes,

367
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
she never mentioned

368
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Andy and the second prince.

369
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
She only asked me not to revenge for him

370
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
and not to fall in love with a man.

371
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
She wanted a child

372
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
who wouldn't betray him.

373
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
But even if it's just a word,

374
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Her Highness still hopes

375
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
to rely on the obedient child.

376
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
She never thought

377
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
that I could not rely on anyone

378
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
to live my own life.

379
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
In that case,

380
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
why should I

381
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
take Her Highness's word

382
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
as my own?

383
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
I should not only

384
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
live as she wishes,

385
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
but also live happily.

386
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
I should also

387
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
live with all my heart

388
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
and do whatever I want.

389
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Except for Zhu Yiwei,

390
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
the first assassin's name,

391
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
I should also find myself

392
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
in the world

393
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
and other meanings in this world.

394
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
For example, me.

395
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
I should be a white horse

396
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
and ride on the wind.

397
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I should run,

398
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
I should smile,

399
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
I should fly,

400
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
and fly to anywhere

401
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
I want to go.

402
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
No.

403
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
My Lord,

404
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
it's been a while since I saw you.

405
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
What are you doing here?

406
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
What do you want?

407
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
My Lord, you haven't been eating well lately.

408
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,440
The new cook in our house

409
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
The tuotu soup is good

410
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,360
You taste

411
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,720
When did you change the cook

412
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,720
Two days ago

413
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,920
From Mingyue Inn

414
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,680
How to do it

415
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,080
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

416
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,600
Be careful in the future

417
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,320
Get up quickly

418
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,120
but

419
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
It's good

420
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,000
Later, the grass carp is the most прис 써

421
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,280
I'll go out

422
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,480
Don't follow up

423
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Come and see

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Come on.

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
He Bao.

426
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Come and see He Bao.

427
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Come and see.

428
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Come and see my He Bao.

429
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You have good taste.

430
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This has the meaning of coming and going.

431
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And this.

432
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This represents good luck.

433
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This represents good luck.

434
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
How much is it?

435
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Two dollars each.

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Okay.

437
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Come again.

438
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Flowers.

439
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Fresh flowers.

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Flowers.

441
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Fresh flowers.

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Give me this one.

443
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Take care.

444
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Do you want to buy flowers?

445
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We picked them this morning.

446
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
These are fresh flowers we picked this morning.

447
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
How much is it?

448
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
One dollar each.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Thank you.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I told you it's mine.

451
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Give it back to me.

452
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Be careful.

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Husband.

454
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Husband, are you okay?

455
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You are so good at martial arts.

456
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You can beat people up.

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I tell you.

458
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
My father is still a jade knight.

459
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
When did I ever fight?

460
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It was this young master who wanted to come and grab the hairpin.

461
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Our master tried to avoid it.

462
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He fell down himself.

463
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes.

464
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We all saw it.

465
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yes.

466
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Even so.

467
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The rules of the jewelry store are also the first to come first.

468
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
My husband is holding it in his hand.

469
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Why do you have to grab it?

470
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Shopkeeper.

471
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes.

472
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Birthday.

473
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This purple jade hairpin was sent to Pei Lai ten days ago.

474
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It was polished by the closed shop.

475
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Now the master comes to get the finished product.

476
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't want to let the boy send the hairpin over.

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
To get the love of this husband.

478
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Now you understand, right?

479
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This hairpin has always been sent by the husband to the young lady.

480
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Some people are indistinguishable.

481
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
No wonder.

482
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Even the hairpin can only be bought by yourself.

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You put your mouth a little cleaner.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Did I say you?

485
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Why are you so anxious?

486
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I only know that some people are engaged.

487
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But his fiancee doesn't even want to talk to him.

488
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
On the contrary.

489
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I heard that there was a news of a marriage.

490
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
He went to the capital out of the capital.

491
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You don't know.

492
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
He is like a snake.

493
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I can't help it.

494
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You talk nonsense.

495
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Little Marquis.

496
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Which thing is so nagging?

497
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
How long do you want me to wait for you outside?

498
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I said I don't know what genes and desires.

499
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I only know this.

500
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
As long as you like it.

501
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If you don't like it, throw it away.

502
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Little Marquis is so romantic.

503
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He is such a sweet boy.

504
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yes.

505
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is so urgent.

506
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
He is not a couple.

507
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He is making trouble.

508
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He chased me.

509
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He threw it away if you don't like it.

510
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He was so aggressive when he was trying to seduce me.

511
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yes.

512
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Stop.

513
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't go there.

514
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This is not the place for you to practice chess.

515
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's no use to you if you annoy the officer.

516
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Thank you for what you did just now.

517
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And last time,

518
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I was bad.

519
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I was too...

520
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I was too...

521
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I was too impatient.

522
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I said something that didn't sound good.

523
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
If I keep arguing with you,

524
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
you won't have a chance to fight with me.

525
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But why did you help me just now?

526
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Because I am in a good mood.

527
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Really?

528
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And now Sha Xi Bu and my Chang Qing's family are in the same boat.

529
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I believe that as long as we find the right way to help each other,

530
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
we can also be together in the future.

531
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,980
I am the

532
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
one who is always with you.

533
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,980
It turns out that Chang Qing Hou is so beautiful when he smiles.

534
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,980
I am the one who is always with you.

535
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
My lady.

536
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
My lady.

537
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
My lady.

538
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's so tiring to wear this in a chess suit.

539
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If the officer knows what happened just now,

540
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
he will be relieved.

541
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He didn't say it,

542
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
but he is always worried about your relationship with Chang Qing Hou.

543
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Don't talk too much.

544
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I am leaving.

545
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I am leaving.

546
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
My lady.

547
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:54,260
So, how that can cause them to die be different,

548
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,260
Please have a taste.

549
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,160
God bless me !

550
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,100
We sportsmen could not cancel into out there victory at anything medal

551
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,360
ROMS

552
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,360
still never know how to do at this time

553
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,920
Well, we sort of show,

554
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,440
Roll up the sleeves,

555
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,240
and take off the colour cap

556
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,560
let not to lose count

557
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,880
Let's taste this

558
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Good, good.

559
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
That's different.

560
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,880
The Jade-Horizontal Stone is also very precious.

561
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
All the ancient stars were dead.

562
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,880
The other soldiers of the Jade-Horizontal Stone are not alive.

563
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
This is clearly coming from father.

564
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
It's Second Brother.

565
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
The only one who can kill Father Yue is Second Brother.

566
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,880
If you have no evidence, don't talk nonsense with me.

567
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,880
That dragon robe, have you really arranged it?

568
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,880
I arranged it myself.

569
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Second Brother wants to rebel.

570
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
I have found evidence.

571
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,880
Are these the dragon robes that Big Brother said?

572
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Thanks to your quickness,

573
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
I can change their lives in time.

574
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Big brother wants to kill Second Brother.

575
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Second brother set up a trap to let the big brother go inside.

576
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,880
They all think I'm blind.

577
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Are you blind?

578
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,880
The eldest son and the East King Li Shouji have resigned from their positions.

579
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
They are all in the sand.

580
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I know very well.

581
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,880
I have been exploring for a long time, but I can't find anything.

582
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Because of the war between the two countries, Tianmen Pass is damaged a lot.

583
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,880
This place is a key point to defend the north.

584
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,880
I am thinking of the three countries' alliance.

585
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I am not specializing in the second son, Luo Xi Wang Li Zhen Ye, to take me out.

586
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,880
I am looking for the truth of the North.

587
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,880
I want to investigate the movement of the North.

588
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
I obey your order.

589
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Marquis Chang Qing,

590
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I think you are in charge of the situation in the court today.

591
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,880
I have checked the progress of the court.

592
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,880
You sent the second prince to investigate Tianmen Pass.

593
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
In this way,

594
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,880
First, you can use the three countries' alliance to block the mouth of the two countries.

595
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Second, you can also guard against the North's aggression to the people.

596
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Third, you can also use the attitude of the Banluo side this time.

597
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Let those statesmen who always urge the crown prince to keep their mouths shut.

598
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
This is the third virtue.

599
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Good idea.

600
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
I don't dare to be a father-in-law.

601
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
But I think,

602
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
with your father-in-law's strategy,

603
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,880
he will not want to see your beloved daughter

604
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,880
only to reject the position of the Marquis' wife.

605
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Then how high do you want to aim?

606
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
The noble consort wants to raise the third prince.

607
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,880
But the Empress Dowager needs a good official.

608
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Xiao Xu's body is the blood of the royal family.

609
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
But he hates to fight.

610
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
If I can take over,

611
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,880
I will change the peace of the country.

612
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Does your wings deserve your eyes?

613
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
Then please wait patiently.

614
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
I believe that in a short time,

615
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Xiao Xu will prove his strength to you.

616
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Go.

617
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
Go.

618
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Stop.

619
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Stop.

620
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,880
You just left the capital.

621
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,280
If you don't want to go to the Ministry of Sand and

622
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,880
Middle Affairs with me,

623
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
you can go back to your sister now.

624
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
I won't go back.

625
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
I'm just sad for my father.

626
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I'm sad for the crown prince.

627
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
How did things turn out like this?

628
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,880
You are too much.

629
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,880
I was just passing by in the dark.

630
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Fortunately, father knows it.

631
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,880
So he still keeps my royal power.

632
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
After I get past this storm,

633
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I will definitely...

634
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
kill you.

635
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Father! Father!

636
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Father!

637
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Are you satisfied now?

638
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Your Highness...

639
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Your Highness...

640
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Who are you?

641
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
You are the second one.

642
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
He is crazy.

643
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
He is not crazy.

644
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Do you know how big the crime is to assassinate the crown prince?

645
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,880
What about the killing of the empress and causing chaos in the country?

646
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,880
That is your good father-in-law, Wang Guo Guo,

647
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,880
and the former Minister of Personnel, Tao Wei.

648
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
You don't recognize them?

649
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Tao Wei?

650
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:53,580
He is the one who set fire to your father-in-law's

651
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,580
I am a human heart.

652
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,580
It's you.

653
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,580
You didn't die.

654
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,580
You did everything.

655
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,580
No.

656
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
You can't kill me.

657
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
I just wanted to destroy him.

658
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,580
I didn't want to kill him.

659
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
I know you want to avenge the empress.

660
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
But you went to see father.

661
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Father didn't allow you to do anything.

662
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,580
Close your eyes.

663
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,580
No.

664
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,580
I beg you.

665
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,580
Don't kill me.

666
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,580
Those who are in chaos, die.

667
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
I am a human heart.

668
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
I don't want to kill you.

669
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
I just want to destroy you.

670
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
I don't want to kill you.

671
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
I don't want to kill you.

672
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
I don't want to kill you.

673
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
I don't want to kill you.

674
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
I don't want to kill you.

675
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
I don't want to kill you.

676
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
I don't want to kill you.

677
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
I don't want to kill you.

678
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I don't want to kill you.

679
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
I don't want to kill you.

680
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
I don't want to kill you.

681
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
I don't want to kill you.

682
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
I don't want to kill you.

683
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
I don't want to kill you.

684
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
I don't want to kill you.

685
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
I don't want to kill you.

686
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
I don't want to kill you.

687
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
I don't want to kill you.

688
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
I don't want to kill you.

689
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
I don't want to kill you.

690
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
I don't want to kill you.

691
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,580
I don't want to kill you.

692
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
I don't want to kill you.

693
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
I don't want to kill you.

694
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
I don't want to kill you.

695
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,620
Teng Manor

696
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,620
Tiger Head?

697
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,620
It's the tiger head?

698
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,620
Tiger Head, it's the tiger head from Teng Manor.

699
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
Teng Manor's people have killed the prince.

700
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,620
They have killed the prince, too!

701
00:39:44,620 --> 00:40:09,840
not

702
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,120
So you think if he gets a laugh,

703
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,520
maybe someone will change his mind?

704
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,640
You supermarket boss,

705
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,880
I'm just trying to know who killed my son.

706
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,880
My son is dead.

707
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,760
Why am I raising you guys with dogs?

708
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,840
I think the second prince is most suspicious of the Chu people.

709
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,840
The former used the method of stealing and stealing.

710
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
He used the obvious defeat to escape punishment.

711
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,840
After all, the second prince's head was the symbol of the East.

712
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,840
The second prince's position as the Crown Prince is naturally stable after the death of the second prince.

713
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,840
The latter may be the Chu people's revenge for the emperor's new army.

714
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,840
As for the Wu people, their king was still locked in Yongan Tower.

715
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
I think they don't have the guts.

716
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Very good.

717
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
You don't count as a boss if you're beaten away.

718
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,840
You still want to cut grass and get rid of roots.

719
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
I'm not old yet.

720
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,840
He's not the only prince.

721
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,840
He still wants to be a big woman and continue to deal with me.

722
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Go and investigate.

723
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Clean up the Chu people immediately and return to Tianmen Pass.

724
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Yes.

725
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Wait.

726
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Go and tell King of Li

727
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,840
to give the Wu people another 30,000 taels of gold.

728
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Otherwise, I will not let them go.

729
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,840
My son is dead.

730
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Why is he so happy?

731
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Yes, sir.

732
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Go.

733
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Go.

734
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Who is this person?

735
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,840
The emperor alone has no regrets.

736
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:18,840
He once accompanied the moon to sing a song of spring breeze.

737
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,840
In the first year, the stone and the jade are flying.

738
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,840
In the second year, the heart and the cup are drinking.

739
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:31,840
In the third year, the red dust and the spring breeze are crying.

740
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Who drinks a cup of wind and snow, and the snow falls into ashes?

741
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Who wants to be separated for a lifetime, and the sky and earth are scattered like flowing water?

742
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,840
Looking back, the future is like this.

743
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,840
The world is precious and the wine is cold.

744
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Who will stay for the rest of his life?

745
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Who is worried about the future without a trace?

746
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Who is afraid that his dream will come true, and he will only come back for the wind and the wind?

747
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:20,840
How many years have passed since the snow fell on the mountain?

748
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:26,840
A lifetime without a trace
