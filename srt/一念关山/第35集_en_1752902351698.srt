1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The wind blows the clouds away, the mountain is the wave of the sky

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The heart is with the sword, the sword is the sword

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The eternal love is like the sky

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The devil is going to make the situation worse

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The wind blows the clouds away, the mountain is the wave of the sky

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The heart is with the sword, the sword is the wave of the sky

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The devil is going to make the situation worse

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The wind blows the clouds away, the mountain is the wave of the sky

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The heart is with the sword, the sword is the wave of the sky

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The devil is going to make the situation worse

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The wind blows the clouds away, the mountain is the wave of the sky

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What scenery can we see?

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm not stopping you. Do you think you can do that?

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Brother 13

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Very good

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yu Shi San, you are here to stop me, right?

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can see it

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You are determined to kill him. I can't stop you

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How about this?

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you going to stop me?

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you crazy? What does this have to do with you?

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What does it have to do with me?

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You killed him for nothing. What about us?

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He Xian and Shao Tie are nearby

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you think the officials will let the king of a country die for no reason?

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you find out anything, all the three books will be buried with you

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I owe you guys

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When we reach the Naihe Bridge, I will drink with you and apologize to you

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What do you apologize for?

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We have been born and died for so many years

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You choose to hide it from us

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We treat you as brothers. What do you treat us as?

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Brother Qian, I treat you as brothers. What do you treat me as?

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Enough. I am guilty

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Enough. I am guilty

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I, Yang Xingyuan, am guilty of underestimating the enemy and taking advantage of the country

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I am guilty of being useless and useless. I am guilty of being selfish and self-sufficient

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I am guilty of being greedy for life and afraid of death

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I am guilty of giving up the loyalty of Wu Mei and the six halls

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ying Ling Kexin problem is called theρα

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When I have the law and power, I'll kill it

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't think that if youAw answer my customize, I am willing to let you go

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I deserve it.

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,960
I've been lying to myself.

45
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
The kings of the ancient times

46
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,600
have their own ways of life.

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,120
As long as I can have the courage,

48
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,800
I'll go back to the East one day.

49
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,920
But now I know I'm not worthy of it.

50
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,120
Do it.

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No! It's Mingdi!

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The Angolans are coming again.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Red and white, not the Angolans.

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's the Northern Plains.

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Northern Plains?

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How do the Northern Plains people get through Tianmen Pass?

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Blue flag.

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There's a wolf's head up there.

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's the northern flag of the Right King of the Northern Plains.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have a map.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can see,

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that's the direction of Tianmen Pass.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's the direction of the Moon Mountain.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's the left side of the left side of the left side.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why isn't there a wolf's head up there?

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There are a lot of Northern Plains people up there.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh no.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mingdi has been missing for three weeks.

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The left side of the left side is a warning to the river.

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now the wolf's head is broken.

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The river can't receive any news.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's no defense.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There's no defense.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then the river will be destroyed.

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Six Daoist Church, listen.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:03,780
Go to the

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not a knife.

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now the world is in a big mess.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't let the people of the right and left have any trouble.

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
When the Northern Plains people are out of the way,

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
we'll kill you.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Go!

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go!

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't fight!

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The people of the left and right are in a big mess.

86
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go!

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Go!

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Go!

89
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Go!

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Brother, we're out of ammo.

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We found the firewood.

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go!

93
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Go!

94
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Lao Qian.

95
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Brother Qian.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Lao Qian!

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Brother Qian.

98
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh

99
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Oh

100
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Location

101
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Warmth death

102
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I know.

103
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will go to the netherworld with you.

104
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I will apologize to your brothers.

105
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Lao Qian.

106
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Lao Qian.

107
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Lao Qian.

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Lao Qian.

109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Lao Qian.

110
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Lao Qian.

111
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yang Xinyue.

112
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Can you die?

113
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I wanted to kill you before.

114
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For the brothers of the netherworld.

115
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And the luggage of the Great Wu.

116
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't want to kill you now.

117
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
For the people of the netherworld.

118
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You are the king of the country.

119
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You should do your duty.

120
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you hear me?

121
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Brother Qian.

122
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Brother Qian.

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Brother Qian.

124
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Brother Qian's safe place is inside.

125
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Brother Qian.

126
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Brother Qian.

127
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Brother Qian.

128
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Brother Qian.

129
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Brother Qian.

130
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Brother Qian.

131
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Brother Qian.

132
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Brother Qian.

133
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Brother Qian.

134
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Where is the whole Su Dynasty?

135
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

136
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
How should I explain it to you?

137
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
General, the left camp is waiting for your master.

138
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Did you see it clearly?

139
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes, it's master.

140
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The left camp is our Great An.

141
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But the people of Chu are here.

142
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Did the people of Chu fight back?

143
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Did the left camp make a mistake?

144
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Close the gate and check it out.

145
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes.

146
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
General, there is a group of people.

147
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think it's not right.

148
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Come in.

149
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Who are you?

150
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The Great Wu's master is here.

151
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
General Wu, I'm from the 13th Wu's delegation.

152
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We met last time.

153
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Do you remember?

154
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes.

155
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The one in front of you is our Great Wu's master.

156
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You are not here to beg for mercy.

157
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why are you here?

158
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We came here on purpose.

159
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We have urgent military situation.

160
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Give me the hat.

161
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
General Wu, Tianmen Pass is broken.

162
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The North Pan's right king led 5,000 troops to the south.

163
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is the hat of their North Pan's soldiers.

164
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We have fought with them in Zuojialing.

165
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Their main force will arrive at He County soon.

166
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We just escaped from Andu.

167
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We tried to escape and lost the county again.

168
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We came to tell you.

169
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's because we know the military situation is urgent.

170
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The 5,000 elite troops of the North Pan

171
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
came to Tianmen Pass and crossed the Cangsong Ridge and Quetou Road.

172
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
They came to He County.

173
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They have no ground to attack He County.

174
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What should they do?

175
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
General Wu, He County is the key point of the border.

176
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The North Pan has already attacked Tianmen Pass.

177
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If they break here again,

178
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
they will be in danger within 100 miles.

179
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But the enemy's troops are strong.

180
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They can't defend He County.

181
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, there is still a chance.

182
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He County is dangerous and hard to attack.

183
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Now we just need to concentrate our strength

184
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and build up our defense.

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
When the reinforcements arrive,

186
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
we can turn the situation around.

187
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Since His Majesty doesn't care about the front line,

188
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
he will stay and fight the enemy in the rain.

189
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I will obey your order.

190
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The evil people of the six Taoists are here.

191
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I am willing to follow you and guard He County.

192
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The evil people of the six Taoists are here.

193
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The evil people of the six Taoists are here.

194
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The evil people of the six Taoists are here.

195
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I am willing to follow His Majesty and guard He County.

196
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We will always be there and will never die.

197
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We will always be there and will never die.

198
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We will fight together!

199
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
100,000 firepower.

200
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes.

201
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I have sent the military intelligence to Wu Du.

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We will be the ones to rely on before reinforcements arrive.

203
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Go!

204
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Go!

205
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
General Wu, look.

206
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The one we destroyed in Zuo Jia Ling is a small army of the Northern Plains.

207
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Brother 13, Ning Tou is not here.

208
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you think we can win?

209
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The Northern Plains

210
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's still dark in there.

211
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes.

212
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
When you were resting, I received a letter from the branch.

213
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It was left by Qian Zhao and the others in Jun Zhou.

214
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But according to the story, they should have arrived at He Xian long ago.

215
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Qian Zhao is the most reliable person in the whole country.

216
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There is no way that he has no news.

217
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's too strange.

218
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What are you doing?

219
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What?

220
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Instead of being afraid, I should hurry to the house.

221
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But you are not fully recovered yet.

222
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The doctor said that your injury is serious.

223
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You can't rush to the house.

224
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't worry.

225
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It won't be too late to rest after we catch up with them.

226
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And I have suffered more than this in the past.

227
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You are bringing up the past again.

228
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
How about this?

229
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
When we arrive at the next Jin Shan House, I will settle you.

230
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I will go to Wu Di myself.

231
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
After I send him back, I will come back to you immediately.

232
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Okay?

233
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Ning Zhou.

234
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We finally meet again.

235
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Are you going to abandon me?

236
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Have you forgotten that we are going to travel together?

237
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

238
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What are you doing?

239
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Stop it!

240
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We are selling the old goods.

241
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We are selling the old goods.

242
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Give us back our money!

243
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We can't leave!

244
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Give us back our money!

245
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Give us back our money!

246
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Give us back our money!

247
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Give us back our money!

248
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This should be the usual struggle.

249
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Give us back our money!

250
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We can't leave!

251
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I am selling the goods that are of the best quality.

252
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Give us back our money!

253
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When did you know that it was fake?

254
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Give us back our money!

255
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You liar!

256
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No.

257
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What he is wearing is the body of a Northern person.

258
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What good goods?

259
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You are a liar!

260
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You are a liar!

261
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You don't want the goods that are of the best quality?

262
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Give us back our money!

263
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That person just now

264
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is a skin-cow-drawer from the West.

265
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
This thing

266
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
was exchanged with a small tribe leader from the North.

267
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The North's king, Wang Ting, sent a message to Su Lu Yuan.

268
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That leader is on his way there with two hundred soldiers.

269
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What did the leader ask for?

270
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The medicine of Xing Jun.

271
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Su Lu Yuan is less than eight hundred miles from Tianmen Pass.

272
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And the whole northern region is a small tribe.

273
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
There are hundreds of them.

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
No.

275
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Those people from the northern region will not be innocent.

276
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's right.

277
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So we have to go to Tianli Pass quickly.

278
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Tianli Pass

279
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Tianli Pass

280
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
All of you, back up!

281
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Shoot!

282
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Catch them at the fastest speed!

283
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Retreat!

284
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Come and run!

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Retreat!

286
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Tianli Pass

287
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
General Wu!

288
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
General Wu!

289
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
General Wu!

290
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
General Wu!

291
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
General Wu!

292
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
General Wu!

293
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He Xian!

294
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'll...

295
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
give...

296
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
you...

297
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Kill!

298
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Keep going!

299
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Kill!

300
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Si Lu, go get Xiao Ji.

301
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Kill them all!

302
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Kill!

303
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Kill!

304
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Kill!

305
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This way!

306
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
This way!

307
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
This way!

308
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Come down!

309
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Come down!

310
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
This way!

311
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Don't let them get away!

312
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Retreat!

313
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Retreat!

314
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Hurry up!

315
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
We won!

316
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
We won!

317
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
We won!

318
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
We won!

319
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Si Lu!

320
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Retreat!

321
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We won!

322
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We won!

323
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We won!

324
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We won!

325
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:41,000
We won! We won! We won!

326
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Sun Lang, the Taoist priest of the Six Halls.

327
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

328
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,000
Ning Tao!

329
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,000
Yuan Lu!

330
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,000
Hey.

331
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What does he know?

332
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,000
Come, show your hand to the Prime Minister.

333
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Yes!

334
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,000
Prime Minister, please let me be your guard.

335
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,500
Tao, I didn't embarrass you this time.

336
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
The Taoist priest of the Six Halls

337
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,500
Brother.

338
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,000
Sun Lang!

339
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,000
Brother Lang!

340
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
Sun Lang!

341
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Brother Wu, Brother Lang.

342
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,000
Sun Lang.

343
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,500
Brother Lang.

344
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Hold on. Hold on!

345
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

346
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
13th Brother.

347
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You're not the most handsome prince.

348
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,500
Why are you so late?

349
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It hurts so much.

350
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,500
I'm sorry.

351
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,500
I'm going to take a bite of this meat.

354
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,500
13th Brother.

355
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm a hero now.

356
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,500
You're a hero.

357
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,500
You're a hero.

358
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You're a hero from head to toe.

359
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
13th Brother.

360
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,500
You're back. Can you be a little later?

361
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,500
13th Brother.

362
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
13th Brother.

363
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm not a child.

364
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I can take you.

365
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,000
Luo Yue.

366
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,500
I...

367
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,500
You're more handsome than the two of them.

368
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
You're more handsome than the next generation.

369
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
You're my son.

370
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm not a child.

371
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm not a child.

372
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
I'm not a child.

373
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I'm not a child.

374
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
I'm not a child.

375
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm not a child.

376
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
I'm not a child.

377
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
I'm not a child.

378
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
I'm not a child.

379
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I'm not a child.

380
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
I'm not a child.

381
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm not a child.

382
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
I'm not a child.

383
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
I'm not a child.

384
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
I'm not a child.

385
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm not a child.

386
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm not a child.

387
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm not a child.

388
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm not a child.

389
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm not a child.

390
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm not a child.

391
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm not a child.

392
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm not a child.

393
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm not a child.

394
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm not a child.

395
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm not a child.

396
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm not a child.

397
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm not a child.

398
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm not a child.

399
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm not a child.

400
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm not a child.

401
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,020
ClearBL .

402
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
clearBL .

403
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,020
clearBL .

404
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,020
clearBL .

405
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,020
clearBL .

406
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,020
.

407
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
.

408
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
.

409
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
clearBL .

410
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
clearBL .

411
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
clearBL .

412
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,020
clearBL .

413
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,660
and sent the Left Lord to He County.

414
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,100
If the Northern Plains does its best

415
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,620
and comes back,

416
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
I'm afraid

417
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,780
we won't have any chance to fight back.

418
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,260
And I'm safe.

419
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,420
The Tianyuan Army should be here soon.

420
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,460
Hasn't the person who sent the message to Junzhou

421
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,740
replied yet?

422
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,100
I'm incompetent.

423
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,820
What's wrong?

424
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,980
I went to Junzhou myself.

425
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,380
But the governor of Junzhou

426
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,540
doesn't believe the Northern Plains

427
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,580
attacked Tianmen Pass.

428
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,260
If not,

429
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,900
the governor would have killed me.

430
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,460
It's because the late Prince Luo Xi

431
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,540
sent a letter back to the capital

432
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,460
and passed by Junzhou.

433
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,740
He said the Tianmen Pass was a mess.

434
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,140
He also said General Wu

435
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,500
had colluded with the country

436
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
and tried to rebel.

437
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,220
I fought to death

438
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,420
to escape back.

439
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,860
Why are they so stupid?

440
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,780
Is there anyone from the Northern Plains in Tianmen Pass?

441
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,780
Send some young men to investigate.

442
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,860
Then they will know.

443
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,740
The governor of Junzhou

444
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,380
is from the Eastern Regions.

445
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,620
The second prince is going back

446
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,660
to be crown prince.

447
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,660
Whatever he says,

448
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,660
the governor of Junzhou will believe it.

449
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,340
You've worked hard.

450
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,100
You may leave.

451
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:08,980
Yes.

452
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
The Emperor

453
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,620
sent the second prince to investigate Tianmen Pass.

454
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,420
But at this time,

455
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,620
the Northern Plains broke the Tianmen Pass.

456
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,740
There is something

457
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,860
strange about it.

458
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,180
No.

459
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,620
It's about the security of the Central Plains

460
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,620
and the prince.

461
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,100
We must send someone

462
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,020
to the capital

463
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,460
to report the truth to Andie.

464
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,380
I will also urge the Wu State to send troops

465
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,420
to reinforce the river.

466
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,140
But the trouble is

467
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,780
who will send the letter to the capital

468
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,060
so that it won't be blocked by

469
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,260
the various barriers left by the second prince?

470
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,340
Your Majesty.

471
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
I think

472
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
we should send Yuan Lu.

473
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,500
Yuan Lu?

474
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,140
The second prince

475
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,060
doesn't know that we are here.

476
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,020
So he must be

477
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,500
directing the letter to the enemy.

478
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,820
Why don't we send Yuan Lu to be a young man?

479
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,540
It's not easy to be noticed.

480
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,780
As long as he can enter the capital,

481
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,580
he can contact Marquis Changqing and Li Tongguang.

482
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,580
If he doesn't remember,

483
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,460
he can also contact the princess.

484
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,260
Through them,

485
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,380
we can pass the military message to Andie.

486
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,140
That's the only way.

487
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,500
When I was on the battlefield,

488
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,820
I didn't feel so painful.

489
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
It hurts more and more.

490
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,020
Listen,

491
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,060
you don't want to go?

492
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,980
If my leg is injured,

493
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,460
you can't be the one to go.

494
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,860
You think anyone can go?

495
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,820
I know.

496
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
You are so shameless.

497
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,260
This is

498
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
the military message of He County.

499
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,940
If you lose it,

500
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
I will beat you to death.

501
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,420
The token given by the commandant

502
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,820
is used when building the palace.

503
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,260
If you encounter any problem, take it out.

504
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,020
Keep it.

505
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,060
In addition,

506
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,260
the food is prepared for you for ten days.

507
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,260
I guess it's enough to eat.

508
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,460
You can't eat too much food.

509
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,340
I prepared some food for you in Dalian.

510
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,900
Eat whatever you want.

511
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,780
Use it if you want.

512
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,820
It's cold.

513
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,540
Buy some clothes for yourself.

514
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,660
Have you brought enough pills?

515
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,060
How many bottles?

516
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,140
How many days?

517
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,540
Enough.

518
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,620
I'll get you some medicine.

519
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,300
Brother 13.

520
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,300
Do you have to go?

521
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,900
He Xin is in a critical situation.

522
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,220
What if I leave and you leave?

523
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,380
Didn't you

524
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,900
tell An Du to split up?

525
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,660
I'm not going.

526
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,700
I want to fight with you.

527
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
What are you fighting about?

528
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,060
Are you being reckless?

529
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,020
It's an emergency.

530
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,500
If Li Tong Guang doesn't listen to Ye Guang,

531
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
what should I do?

532
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,820
Should I drag this injured leg?

533
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,220
Or should I rely on my beautiful face

534
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,780
to go to An Du

535
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,100
and be recognized by everyone?

536
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,220
Don't be so careless.

537
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,620
You go if I tell you to.

538
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,020
You're the careless one.

539
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,660
Don't make yourself tired.

540
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,500
Every time you pass by a station,

541
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,180
you must take a break before going up.

542
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,940
Do you hear me?

543
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,580
You're really careless.

544
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
I'm sorry.

545
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,980
You're not not coming back.

546
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,060
I'm not coming back.

547
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,980
If you don't see me again,

548
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,580
get on the horse.

549
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,140
Be careful on the road.

550
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,540
I will complete the task.

551
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,100
Keep this.

552
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,940
I won't recognize you

553
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,420
if you don't see me again.

554
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,500
Have you gained weight?

555
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,940
You're always alone.

556
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,780
You won't lose your eyes, right?

557
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,260
You're so stupid.

558
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,020
You're so stupid.

559
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,220
This kid

560
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,540
seems to have grown taller recently.

561
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,820
Brother Li,

562
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,180
did you make this on purpose?

563
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,020
The traitor will come.

564
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,700
If he also takes the risk of death,

565
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,020
how can I explain to Ning

566
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,540
in the midst of the situation?

567
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,060
I saw the report from Zhang Du Wei.

568
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,660
Mei Er is dead.

569
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,900
She was buried in the Zhu Yi Wei.

570
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,380
Ning lost his temper.

571
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,220
He didn't plan to come back alive.

572
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,820
Don't be sad.

573
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,580
Life is in the past.

574
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,180
Isn't it just to live a happy life?

575
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,540
I think Ning,

576
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,980
Qian,

577
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,180
Sun Le,

578
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,180
they all have their own death.

579
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,540
They have no regrets.

580
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,820
Let's go.

581
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,580
This is the most beautiful headlamp I have.

582
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,660
Who will hold it in the future?

583
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,980
Who drinks a cup of wind and snow,

584
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,340
and falls into the sea of regret?

585
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,060
Who sighs as he is scattered,

586
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,580
and the sky is scattered like water?

587
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,660
Looking back, the future is so beautiful.

588
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,580
The world is so beautiful.

589
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,220
Who will stay for the rest of his life?

590
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,340
Who is drunk and worried?

591
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,340
Who is fearless?

592
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,180
Who is afraid that his dream will come true,

593
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,740
and he will only come back as a tyrant?

594
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,820
How many years have passed

595
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,780
since he was scattered in the snow?

596
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:36,780
He is drunk and has no one to share his life with.

597
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,340
He is a tyrant.

598
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
He is a tyrant.

599
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,660
He is a tyrant.

600
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,820
He is a tyrant.

601
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,980
He is a tyrant.

602
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,140
He is a tyrant.

603
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,300
He is a tyrant.

604
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,460
He is a tyrant.

605
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,620
He is a tyrant.

606
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,780
He is a tyrant.

607
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,940
He is a tyrant.
