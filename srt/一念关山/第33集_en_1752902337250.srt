Pft!

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,400
Sure it was fun, yeah?

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is blue.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
The snow is like the sunset.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
The wind blows the clouds and the sky is blue.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
The snow is like the sunset.

00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
The love poem is like the love poem.

00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
The love poem is like the love poem.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
The love poem is like the love poem.

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
The love poem is like the love poem.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
The love poem is like the love poem.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
The love poem is like the love poem.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
The love poem is like the love poem.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I wish to cross the mountain and cross the river.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
I wish to stay by your side and never fall.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,400
I look at the endless sky.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,400
The moon is like the moon.

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I wish to cross the mountains and cross the rivers.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,400
I wish to be with you forever.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,400
I still remember the past.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I still remember the past.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Smart baby drink the flying crane.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Flying crane milk powder invites you to watch the mountain.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Thick tomato noodles.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Good luck, red sky.

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Master Kang tomato egg beef noodles

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
invites you to watch the mountain.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Tao'er.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Ru Yi and the others...

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
They haven't heard from us yet.

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
How are the injuries of the injury and Master Du?

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Master Du is awake.

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
He is fine.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
But the injuries on his body...

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
He is not well.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
He is not well.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
He is not well.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
He is not well.

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
He is not well.

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
But the injuries on his body...

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Brother Qian said that the past is not well.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
It depends on tonight.

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Where is the blood sample you prepared?

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Here.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
The teeth have been tried to draw.

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
The teeth have been tried to draw.

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
If it doesn't work,

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
it means that his body is seriously injured.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
It's not good for his skin.

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
So the teeth are not good.

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
There is only one way to find out.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Qian.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
You can rest.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Even if you leave all your inner force to the emperor,

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
there is no way to make up for it.

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
No, not yet.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
He can't die here.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Even if he dies,

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
we need to end the matter.

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
You can go.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Qian is from the heavenly island and he controls the palace.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
He is responsible for the fire.

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
也是他的职责所在…her duties…

69
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,240
君崎?Junqi?

70
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,300
朕 又重其位……I am facadeaning.

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
times of累ing

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:05:00,240
in Herodotus

73
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,240
dear�

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
save me from the fire of water

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
I should be rewarded by all

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Your Majesty

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Your Majesty

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Yi Zhao

79
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Yi Zhao

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Your Majesty

81
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Your Majesty

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Here

83
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
I have checked

84
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I have checked

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Keep it

86
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I am sorry for the fire

87
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Your Majesty

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
It's just a head injury

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
There is no answer in my heart

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
You guys come out with me

91
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Wait a minute

92
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I didn't expect that His Majesty wrote the blood oath

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
It's okay

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
He is fine now

95
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Qian Zhao

96
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
I will leave the rest to you

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
You will take the rest of the people

98
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
to send His Majesty back to Wuguo safely

99
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Aren't you going back with us?

100
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
You are going to Andu?

101
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Yes

102
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
His Highness is still in Andu

103
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
He has been thinking since he was a child

104
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I can't leave him alone

105
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Okay, we will go with you

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
No need

107
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
You and your brother Qian

108
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Send His Majesty back safely

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
You are lying to me

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Will you come back after you go?

111
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
The roadside has said

112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
His Highness is being rescued by a beauty

113
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I haven't heard from her yet

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I am afraid she has

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
You are in the wrong now

116
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
There were two accidents in Donghu yesterday

117
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
You are not going to save people

118
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
But to die

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Tong

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Tong

121
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
What is death?

122
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
How many times have I died?

123
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
When did I die?

124
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
It's okay

125
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Come, Qian Zhao

126
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
His Majesty has to do the laundry

127
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I will leave it to you

128
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
I will leave it to you

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I will leave my old house to you

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Take good care of it for me

131
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Sun Lang

132
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
The brothers who are in the same boat

133
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Take good care of them for me

134
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
If I can't come back

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
There is still one chance for His Highness to survive

136
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
You promise me

137
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
You must take care of her as your own sister

138
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
No need

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Take care of your own sister

140
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Yes, I don't care either

141
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I take care of those little cats and dogs every day

142
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I am so busy

143
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Brother who is not poisonous

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Ning Tong, you come back and take care of it yourself

145
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
You are the owner of the six hall

146
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
For the brother Xueyuan

147
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
You have to do it yourself

148
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I have to stay and take care of the old house every time

149
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I have already seen it all

150
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I promise you

151
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I will

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Take Ying and Ruyi

153
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
And go to the other side

154
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I will come back safely to see you

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Trust me

156
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
I will not forget

157
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
People are still scattered

158
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
The past is still a joke

159
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
When the knife suddenly turns its hand

160
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
How are you

161
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Tao

162
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
This is the medicine I use to save lives

163
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Only one

164
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
The poison is strong

165
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
The dark is long

166
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Tao

167
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I only have the thunder and fire

168
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
The night is quiet and the day is long

169
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
The beauty is in the wind and frost

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Where is the love

171
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,400
The love is hidden in the city

172
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
The good fortune is good

173
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,080
Wind

174
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
I am not willing to go to the mountain

175
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,440
The chasers fell

176
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
With one heart and 1 side

177
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Look at the end of the eternal night

178
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Drive the dead to the sky

179
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,440
The devil is going to add a situation

180
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Wind

181
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I'm not willing to go to the mountain

182
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
The chasers fell

183
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
With one heart and 1 side

184
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Look at the end of the eternal night

185
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Drive the dead to the sky

186
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,080
Four Look请大得越去

187
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Don't tell anyone I've been here.

189
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Yes.

190
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
You go first.

191
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I'll go first.

192
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
I'll send someone to check it out.

193
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Let's go, Mr. Du.

194
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
It's late.

195
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
We can't afford to be late.

196
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm not going.

197
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Since you can go back to the capital with Miss Ruyi for the sake of the crown prince,

198
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,440
how can I live in peace?

199
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Moreover,

200
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,440
my life was saved by the crown prince.

201
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
But you're seriously injured.

202
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Besides,

203
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
you've been gone for hours.

204
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
You can't catch up.

205
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
I can catch up.

206
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
No matter what,

207
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I have to go back to Andu.

208
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
The road to the capital,

209
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
the road to the capital.

210
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
I was the one who went with you to the capital.

211
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,440
I must be right.

212
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
What if the crown prince and Lord Ning...

213
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
I will bring them back.

214
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Mr. Du, please wait.

215
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Your Majesty.

216
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,440
The poison of the Qing Dynasty has been so powerful.

217
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,440
I'm afraid that the poison will be too strong.

218
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,440
The poison of the Qing Dynasty is very powerful.

219
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,440
I have nothing to do.

220
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
I can only...

221
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
bury them one by one.

222
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
When the poison comes back,

223
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
I will be alone in the capital.

224
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
I...

225
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
thank you, Your Majesty.

226
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Thank you.

227
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Come back safely.

228
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

229
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Li Tong.

230
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Li Tong.

231
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Who are you burning the paper for?

232
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Impossible.

233
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Impossible.

234
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
If the poison is so powerful,

235
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
even Yuan Zhuang can't beat him.

236
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
How could he...

237
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Didn't you lose the crown prince?

238
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Didn't you have the power?

239
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Why didn't you save him?

240
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Who is the murderer?

241
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Who is the murderer?

242
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Who is so vicious and despicable?

243
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Tell me, I want to kill him.

244
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
You'd better take care of yourself first.

245
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
I can only let him live here for a few days...

246
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,440
without the power.

247
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
When he's alive,

248
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
you can take care of him.

249
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Can he kill me?

250
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
He can kill you.

251
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,440
He can invite you to the place where the north is cold.

252
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
He can throw you out of the mountain.

253
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
The Northern Regions must like you very much.

254
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
The little birds in the south of the Yangtze River,

255
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
whether they stay free

256
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
or you want the whole country to be destroyed,

257
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
they are all dead.

258
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Cry if you want to.

259
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
After tonight,

260
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,440
we may not have time to be sad.

261
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
No.

262
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
I can't die like this.

263
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Ruyi said

264
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,440
only the weak will survive.

265
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Your Highness.

266
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Your Highness.

267
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
We are all waiting for you.

268
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
I'm Li Tongguang.

269
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

270
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
King of Wu, Li, has arrived.

271
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
King of Wu, Li, Yang Ying,

272
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
greets, Your Majesty.

273
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Your brother has escaped.

274
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
I'm sure you have great achievements.

275
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
I have nothing to congratulate you on.

276
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
There are three things here.

277
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
You can choose one.

278
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Your Majesty, I'm sure I'm talented.

279
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
Aren't you afraid of the world's

280
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
words of worry?

281
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Words of worry?

282
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm afraid that you're afraid of the world's

283
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
words of worry.

284
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
King of Wu, Li,

285
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
colluded with the Northern Plains

286
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
to enter our mountain,

287
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
trying to disrupt our great peace.

288
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
He is guilty.

289
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Hey.

290
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I'll buy you another drink.

291
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Let go!

292
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Do you think I'm deliberately

293
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
to kill you or to die?

294
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
You're wrong.

295
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Duke of Qin.

296
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
I

297
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
just want to make a deal

298
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
with you.

299
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
You want to

300
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
play tricks on me?

301
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
As long as you're willing to accept it,

302
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
not only can it help you stabilize the political situation,

303
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
but also help you

304
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
to recover your power

305
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
to communicate with the Northern Plains.

306
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Okay, I'll listen to you.

307
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Go on.

308
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
You wanted to win the

309
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
title of Princess of another country,

310
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
but you couldn't find a suitable

311
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
candidate.

312
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
I can help you

313
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
to realize your wish.

314
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I'll listen to you.

315
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
How will you help me?

316
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
I'll listen to you.

317
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Princess Li Cheng of Da Wu,

318
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Yang Ying,

319
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
and Da An.

320
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
Your Majesty,

321
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
you've seen me as a woman.

322
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
But I'm

323
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
a woman.

324
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
In the Western Xia,

325
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
there are only three princes,

326
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Dan Yang and Ying.

327
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
I'm not old enough

328
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
to dress up as a woman

329
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
and take the throne.

330
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
But they'll abandon me

331
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
because I'm too young to do so.

332
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Now,

333
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
I don't want to

334
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
fight for Da Wu.

335
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Your Majesty,

336
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
my brother should still be

337
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
in the country.

338
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
Dan Yang, the king of the country,

339
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
hasn't received

340
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
any news about Dan Yang.

341
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
If that's the case,

342
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
why don't you use your power

343
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
to make an agreement with my brother

344
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
and send him back

345
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
to the country

346
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
and leave me in Da An?

347
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
At the same time, you'll lose your

348
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
position and your position.

349
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
If you go back to the country,

350
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
you'll have to

351
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
have an argument with Dan Yang

352
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
and make a deal.

353
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
In the end,

354
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
whoever wins,

355
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
they'll be badly hurt.

356
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
By then,

357
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
you'll need

358
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
your help

359
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
to form a brotherly alliance with them.

360
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
I remember

361
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
that both of your princes

362
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
were not very competitive.

363
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Don't you want

364
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
a new legitimate son

365
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
to be the heir

366
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
of the two countries?

367
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
At that time,

368
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
who would remember your old

369
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
relationship with the Northern Plains?

370
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
You're so bold.

371
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
If I'm not bold enough,

372
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
how can I

373
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
stand the wildness

374
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
of my country?

375
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
I'm not bold enough.

376
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
No wonder

377
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
I sent you

378
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
to be the

379
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
heir of the two countries.

380
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
My brother has already

381
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
disappeared.

382
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,760
Am I not successful enough?

383
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,520
You are too successful.

384
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,280
You are too successful.

385
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,880
But...

386
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,360
you...

387
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,600
should change your name.

388
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
Don't call me anymore.

389
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,480
You should call me...

390
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
Chen Qi.

391
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,920
Why are you so anxious, Your Majesty?

392
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,480
After the edict from the Empress,

393
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,480
I will change my name again.

394
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,080
It won't be too late.

395
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,320
That's right.

396
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,040
Pass the edict.

397
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,760
Princess Li Cheng...

398
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,920
has left Changhua Palace...

399
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,000
to attend the Empress's funeral.

400
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I will...

401
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,400
take her place.

402
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

403
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,960
Master Qing,

404
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,760
come over.

405
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,440
I have something valuable to share...

406
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,160
in the Final Stuffing Hall...

407
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,640
for you.

408
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
You're really a woman?

409
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Sister Ru Yi taught me every day

410
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
two months of homework.

411
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
If I can't even fool you,

412
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
I'll really let her down.

413
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
But you can't be such a woman.

414
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
You're a woman.

415
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
You're a woman.

416
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
But you can't be such a woman.

417
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
You're a woman.

418
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
You're a woman.

419
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
You're a woman.

420
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
You're a woman.

421
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
You're a woman.

422
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
But you can't tell me everything.

423
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
You're such a big burden.

424
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
You won't really save me.

425
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I can only save myself.

426
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
You said that your brother Andy liked interest the most.

427
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
The most valuable thing in my body.

428
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Only this so-called royal blood left.

429
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
In this aspect, Li Tong Guang,

430
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
you're no different from me.

431
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
Do you think the Empress of the Yi Country is so easy to do?

432
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
Do you think His Majesty is so stupid

433
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
that he can solve a few problems in the palace?

434
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
At least

435
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
he's willing to be hooked.

436
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
At least

437
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,080
I won't be thrown into the North to be raised.

438
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
A few days ago,

439
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Yuan Lu once asked me

440
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
if I could return safely to Wudu,

441
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
what would I do in the future?

442
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
I couldn't answer at that time.

443
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Now I know

444
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,080
I don't want to return to that cold harem

445
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
and marry a prince consort I don't know

446
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
and be a rich and powerful woman.

447
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Just like just now.

448
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
That feeling of

449
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,080
grabbing your own destiny.

450
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
You're so nice.

451
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Brother Yan Zhou said

452
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,080
you have the heart of a humble subject.

453
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
So

454
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,080
compared to the third prince who supported the palace maid,

455
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
and the legitimate son who supported me as a princess,

456
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
aren't you more likely to win?

457
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
It's quite common.

458
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
The old man doesn't even let you live in the palace.

459
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
He doesn't believe you at all.

460
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Yes.

461
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
I am a beast.

462
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Then please

463
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
find Sister Ruyi's remains earlier

464
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
and bury them well.

465
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Otherwise

466
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
don't blame me for being a pest to my brother.

467
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
I will do my best behind master's back.

468
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
But

469
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
I still hope you can really be the queen

470
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,080
and come back to give me the order after you become the queen.

471
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Is my sedan ready?

472
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Get on the sedan!

473
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Sister Ruyi

474
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
I don't know if what I did was right or wrong.

475
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
But I'm sure

476
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
I like the feeling now.

477
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Then I swear

478
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
I won't run away anymore.

479
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
I will be strong.

480
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
I am the ambassador of Chijie Camp.

481
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Those who insult me

482
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,080
will be killed.

483
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
I

484
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
am the king of Da Wu.

485
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Please

486
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,080
So you know that King Li is the princess, right?

487
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
What do you think?

488
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Princess Li Ren may have a good reputation

489
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
but she is actually a pawn sent by the Wu State.

490
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
So regardless of age,

491
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
this marriage

492
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
is not necessary.

493
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,080
And if the queen really has a son,

494
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
the emperor is not afraid

495
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
that the Wu State will take advantage of the queen's family

496
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
to take over our Great Khan.

497
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
After all, the emperor is a golden horse.

498
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
What if one year...

499
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
You are cursing me.

500
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
The day the emperor lives forever,

501
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
I will definitely follow the emperor.

502
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Although the word of the wise is ungrateful,

503
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
it comes from the heart of the minister.

504
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Deng Hui

505
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Now in front of me,

506
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,080
only you dare to say these words.

507
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
I

508
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
will not only say the words of the wise.

509
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,080
The marriage contract can still be announced.

510
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
But in the edict,

511
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,080
it can be a bit blurry.

512
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
I will entrust Princess Li Cheng with safety

513
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
and the good of the two countries.

514
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Your Majesty, don't forget

515
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
that the second prince is still not married.

516
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
This crown princess

517
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,080
is much better than the queen.

518
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Your Majesty

519
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Master Tang

520
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
How is the crown prince?

521
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
The crown prince is fine.

522
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
He stayed at the Qing Palace for a few days.

523
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Yes, he left the palace today.

524
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
I especially watched him from afar.

525
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Where is Ruyi?

526
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Any news about Ruyi?

527
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
Where is his body?

528
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
The day before yesterday,

529
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Zhu Yiwei's commander Deng Hui personally led the men

530
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
to be buried in the headquarter of Zhu Yiwei.

531
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Jin Bangzhu took the men

532
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
and buried them in the grave.

533
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
He is indeed a real man.

534
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Master Tang, please accept my condolences.

535
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
I've thought about it for a long time.

536
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
It's okay.

537
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
It's okay.

538
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
It's okay.

539
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
We are all people who have been through hell.

540
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
We have long been used to seeing death.

541
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
The truth is kept outside the palace.

542
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
If you find the crown prince's head

543
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
and leave the palace,

544
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
please report to me.

545
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
The machine's horse is ready.

546
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Yes.

547
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
I'll go.

548
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
What do you want me to say to you?

549
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,080
What's the point of telling me to say it?

550
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
I will come back safely.

551
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Like rain, like snow, flying

552
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
If you and I

553
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Try it.

554
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,080
The rain of love will fall

555
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,080
I'm afraid it's like a flood

556
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,080
I'm not in the heart of the beauty

557
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,080
You and I are in the same boat

558
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,080
I dare not blow this time

559
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,080
I am a farewell

560
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Is it the end of us?

561
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

562
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

563
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

564
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Empty the yearning

565
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
The yearning is broken

566
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,080
This life is a wish

567
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,080
This is the red city

568
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
No more beauty

569
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
This color is too exaggerated.

570
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Good looking.

571
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
I'm a sugar master.

572
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm dressed like a groom.

573
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
That's it.

574
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,080
I dare not blow this time

575
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,080
I am a farewell

576
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Is it the end of us?

577
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

578
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:04,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

579
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:12,080
Empty the yearning

580
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:19,080
This life is a wish

581
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

582
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:34,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

583
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,080
Empty the yearning

584
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,080
This life is a wish

585
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Don't talk.

586
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
I will come back safely.

587
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

588
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:03,080
It's hard to tell if it's a sin.

589
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:10,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

590
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

591
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:25,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

592
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:32,080
I'm afraid dreams are too beautiful

593
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Ruyi

594
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
When I save Ying

595
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
I'll come to you.

596
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
G-Bang

597
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
G-Bang

598
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
G-Bang

599
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
G-Bang

600
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
G-Bang

601
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
My brother escaped.

602
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
G-Bang

603
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Is there anyone?

604
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,080
Give me a new G-Bang.

605
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Is there anyone?

606
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Is there anyone?

607
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
My brother is in the water.

608
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
The emperor is in the water.

609
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
The emperor is in the water.

610
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
Thank you.

611
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
You can't send this message out.

612
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,080
You can't send this message out.

613
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,080
Turn off the light.

614
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
Yes.

615
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Turn off the light.

616
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
Brother 13

617
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Brother 13

618
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,080
It's safe ahead.

619
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,080
OK

620
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
It's snowing.

621
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,080
I've been driving every day these days.

622
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
You must remember to take care of your health.

623
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
Is it finished?

624
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
You're thoughtful.

625
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,080
The battle on the way to Angu

626
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
And pigeons are all gone.

627
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Otherwise, I have to be chased by the soldiers.

628
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,080
Yeah

629
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
Brother 13

630
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
How about we go find some food?

631
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,080
The brothers who have been driving these days have worked hard.

632
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
OK, let's go.

633
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
I'll go get some water.

634
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
OK

635
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Jinghui

636
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
Yes

637
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Come on

638
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
Take two people to get some water with me.

639
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Yes

640
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
Where is this?

641
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
Your Majesty

642
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
It's the center of Xingyitian Road.

643
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
He County

644
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Yes

645
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,080
It's where our country is defeated in Angu.

646
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,080
We've been on the road.

647
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,080
Finally, we have an end.

648
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
The winner is the king, the loser is the leader.

649
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
I'm sorry to the people of Da Wu.

650
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,080
You can have a good rest when you get to He County.

651
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,080
I promise you can sleep well there.

652
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:26,080
I'll take you to sleep.

653
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,600
Chief Li Cheng

654
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,080
Who wants to separate in a lifetime

655
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,080
The sky is scattered like flowing water

656
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,080
Looking back at the past, the road is so beautiful

657
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:01,080
The world is so beautiful

658
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,080
Who will stay for the rest of their lives

659
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,080
Who is drunk and worried at the same time

660
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,080
The heart is fearless

661
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,080
Who wants to dream of the future

662
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,080
Only for the wind to come back

663
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,080
The world is so beautiful

664
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:27,080
How many years have passed

665
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:34,080
The life is endless
