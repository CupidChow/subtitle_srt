I will come to Andu to save you as soon as possible.

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
So you must live.

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,560
You must live and wait for me.

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Come.

21
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Sister Ruyi.

22
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
You received the news of Feige?

23
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Yes.

24
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Is there any news about the fire at the gate?

25
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Not yet.

26
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,560
But two days ago, the second prince's carriage just passed by.

27
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I heard that he was going to marry Princess Li Cheng.

28
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
I hope we are thinking too much.

29
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Meiniang, please pay more attention to the military situation.

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
No problem.

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Deng Hui has already said that he is willing to cooperate with me regardless of the situation.

32
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,560
I will also remind the people of the north in the letter.

33
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,560
We still have to continue to the direction of Tianmen Pass.

34
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
The horse for the exchange.

35
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
I have prepared it early.

36
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
I also asked someone to prepare food for you.

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Leave after you finish using it.

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Thank you.

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Your health.

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,560
It's okay.

41
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,560
You can go now.

42
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Thank you.

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Let's go.

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Go.

45
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Go.

46
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Go.

47
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Go.

48
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Go.

49
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Go.

50
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Go.

51
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Go.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Go.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Go.

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Go.

55
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Why is Yuan Lu here?

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
That's right.

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
He should be with the old men.

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Go in.

59
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Go.

60
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Go.

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
The head.

62
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
The head.

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
That's right.

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
The head is easy to cut.

65
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Why is it here?

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Go.

67
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Go.

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Go.

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Go.

70
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Go.

71
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Go.

72
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Go.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Go.

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Go.

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Go.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
The head.

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Please.

78
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Prepare some water,

79
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
liver, medicine, bandage,

80
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
and a girl's clothes.

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Hurry up and arrange it.

82
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Okay.

83
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Master, I just received news that

84
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
something happened at Tianmu Temple.

85
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
The traitor actually...

86
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
The second prince is here.

87
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
The two cities have already sent troops to support,

88
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
but the river is not large enough.

89
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Now the wolf master has gathered tens of thousands of people at Tianmu Temple.

90
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
The river will be in danger in this battle.

91
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
The Wu State is already in the battle.

92
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
If the river is broken,

93
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
the North Chinese will probably turn to Angu.

94
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,560
The river here is far from the Andu.

95
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
We are going to the river alone.

96
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I'm afraid it's also a water-drenched trip.

97
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
The most important thing is

98
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
we have to hurry up and let Andy

99
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
take the troops and support them.

100
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,560
This will prevent the North Chinese from entering the border.

101
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
But what if

102
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,560
this is what Andy asked the second prince to do?

103
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Last time he wanted to work with the North Chinese secretly.

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
The second prince was sent to Tianmu Temple.

105
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Is there anything wrong with this?

106
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Don't think about it.

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
We will rush back to the Andu

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
and force Andy to send troops.

109
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
The second prince is going to the Andu.

110
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
The second prince is going to the Andu.

111
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
The third prince is going to the Andu.

112
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

113
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

114
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

115
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

117
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

118
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

120
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

121
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

122
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
The fourth prince is going to the Andu.

123

134
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,760
Brother, what's wrong with you?

135
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,360
Brother, is there a place to sell horses?

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,160
Brother, there's no horses in a place like ours.

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,560
Only cattle and sheep.

138
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,560
But if you want horses, you have to go to Andu or Xianli.

139
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
You have to go tomorrow morning.

140
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Where are you going in the middle of the night?

141
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
Andu, how far is Li City?

142
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
About 80 miles.

143
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
What time is it?

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Today is the fifth.

145
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Brother, what happened to you?

146
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,560
Why do you look so pale?

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,960
About 80 miles.

148
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,360
Brother, do you have wine?

149
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,160
Yes, I do.

150
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
Brother.

151
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
You...

152
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Please look after the horses for me.

153
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Brother.

154
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Brother, are you running to Andu?

155
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
Wen Nantian.

156
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Wen Nantian.

157
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
How many miles more?

158
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,560
No, 69 miles.

159
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,960
Yuan Lu, stop running.

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,560
Are you crazy?

161
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,360
I told you to rest every day.

162
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,560
You're going to be deaf to me.

163
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm sorry, Brother Xu.

164
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,560
This time, I'm afraid I can't hear you again.

165
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
I'm sorry.

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm sorry.

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
I'm sorry.

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
I'm sorry.

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,560
I'm afraid I can't hear you again.

177
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,080

The end of the evening

186

Let me in.

00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Don't come in.

194
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
The ceremony is about to begin.

195
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
If anyone enters the capital,

196
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
we will investigate him.

197
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
Stop him!

198
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Don't shoot!

199
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
Why am I getting more and more emotional?

200
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
It's like I'm looking for wings.

201
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Now that fool Li Zhenye is back.

202
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I asked you to come here today

203
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
because I wanted you to come back.

204
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
I asked you to come here today

210
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
because I wanted you to come back.

211
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Once he becomes the Crown Prince,

212
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
you can't leave.

213
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
I told you I wouldn't leave.

214
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Then don't blame me for not helping you.

215
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Li Tunguang!

216
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Li Tunguang!

217
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Li Tunguang!

218
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Who's talking outside?

219
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
You heard it wrong.

220
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Li Tunguang!

221
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
I've said what I should say.

222
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Don't talk.

223
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Li Tunguang!

224
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Stop!

225
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Yuan Lu!

226
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Let him go!

227
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I told you to let him go!

228
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Yuan Lu!

229
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Wake up!

230
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Why are you here?

231
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Yuan Lu!

232
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
You can't go back.

233
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,820
Let me go!

234
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Yuan Lu!

235
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
You can't go back!

236
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Yuan Lu!

237
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
You can't go back!

238
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Yuan Lu!

239
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,820
Yuan Ruo!

240
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Don't be cold.

241
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Call the doctor.

242
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
Yes.

243
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Chang Cui.

244
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Yuan Ruo.

245
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Betrayal.

246
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Betrayal.

247
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
The betrayal has entered Tianmen Pass.

248
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,820
The military is dead.

249
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Only the money can save He Xie.

250
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
This is military treasure.

251
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:30,820
This is the blood of General He Xie.

252
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Hurry.

253
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Go to the 13th Pavilion.

254
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
They can't hold on.

255
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I'm going to the palace.

256
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
You listen to His Highness.

257
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Yes.

258
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Go.

259
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Hurry.

260
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Don't find the doctor.

261
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,820
I ran for several days before I arrived in An Du.

262
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
I ran thousands of miles.

263
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,820
I...

264
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
I...

265
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
I was very scared.

266
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
You are great.

267
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
You are the best.

268
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
I couldn't do many things well.

269
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,820
But I was the fastest runner in the Six Halls.

270
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
I know.

271
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
I was the fastest runner.

272
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
I know.

273
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
You were the fastest runner.

274
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
You don't know.

275
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
You don't know.

276
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,820
Then what did you do in the Five Halls?

277
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
You don't know.

278
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
Do you have someone you like?

279
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Yes.

280
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
I have someone.

281
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,820
I don't know.

282
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
But he will never like me.

283
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
So I never want him to know.

284
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
But...

285
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
Huang Ming Duan...

286
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
I don't dare to tell you.

287
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
I...

288
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Ning Tuo.

289
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
I went back to find you.

290
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
I didn't see you for several days.

291
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,820
I knew you were having a hard time with Ru Yi.

292
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
Something happened.

293
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
It's okay.

294
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
I will come to you.

295
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,820
If in the next life...

296
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
We...

297
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
We...

298
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
We...

299
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
I'm scared.

300
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
Don't worry.

301
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
I'm a short-lived ghost.

302
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
I'm not as lucky as you.

303
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
Just hit me.

304
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Hit me.

305
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
I promise you.

306
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:23,820
This life is like a yearning.

307
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,820
This life is like a yearning.

308
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
I promise you.

309
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Yuan Lu.

310
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
Yuan Lu.

311
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Yuan Lu.

312
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Yuan Lu.

313
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Yuan Lu.

314
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
Don't scare me, Yuan Lu.

315
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
I don't want to play with you.

316
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Yuan Lu.

317
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Yuan Lu.

318
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
Yuan Lu, what are you doing?

319
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
Big Xiaosi.

320
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,820
Let Prince Ling rest first.

321
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
We will test him another day.

322
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
That's right.

323
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Don't worry, Your Highness.

324
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm here.

325
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Your Highness is great.

326
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
That's right.

327
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Go forward.

328
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
Your Highness.

329
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,820
The birds that were sent to the land of peace are fire-free.

330
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
When you think of it, I will let it call.

331
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Bastard.

332
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
Your Highness, I will come to you.

333
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Yuan Lu.

334
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
I promise you.

335
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
I will not let you die.

336
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
Then...

337
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Can you make it a better medicine?

338
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,820
It's better to be sweet.

339
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
It's better to be sour.

340
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
It's bitter.

341
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Why are you so happy when you eat bitter food?

342
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
Because I can eat medicine.

343
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
That means I'm still alive.

344
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Of course I'm happy to be alive.

345
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,820
Then we all have to be fine.

346
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,820
When things here are over,

347
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,820
let's go to Yuan Zhou and Ruyi's room together.

348
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
It's a deal.

349
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
It's a deal.

350
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Yuan Lu.

351
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,820
Why did the gods push him?

352
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,820
Father.

353
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Father.

354
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,820
Father.

355
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,820
You look a little like me.

356
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
Good.

357
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,820
You've suffered a lot.

358
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
I'm not a hard worker.

359
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,820
I've never been to the outside of the Pass before.

360
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
I've learned a lot.

361
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,820
I've read your memorial.

362
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,820
Tianmen Pass is almost repaired.

363
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,820
Did you find anything about the North?

364
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,820
Not yet.

365
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,820
But I'll pay attention to my work.

366
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
The North is afraid of you.

367
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Uncle Qing.

368
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
It's a big crime to break the law.

369
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
Uncle Qing.

370
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
But it's really urgent.

371
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Princess Li Cheng has sent an urgent message from He County.

372
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,820
He County?

373
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Do you think the people of Wu State want to take back their land?

374
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
Father, don't listen to him.

375
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
I just came back from there.

376
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Where did you get this urgent message?

377
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
You!

378
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,820
Impudence!

379
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,820
Your Majesty, please punish me after reading the memorial.

380
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,820
Leave.

381
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,820
The North's traitors?

382
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
Impossible.

383
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,820
This is impossible.

384
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,820
I swear to my life.

385
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
This is definitely not true.

386
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,820
You bastard!

387
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,820
Who gave you the guts to collude with the North and hide your love?

388
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,820
How did I give birth to a bastard like you?

389
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
Father!

390
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,820
Father!

391
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Father!

392
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,820
Father, I was wrong.

393
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,820
But I was forced to do it.

394
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,820
I had to do it.

395
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
I just took them to He County.

396
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
It was originally Wu Huanyuan's place.

397
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,820
This is General Wu's blood.

398
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,820
He led the people to die in the battle.

399
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,820
Behind the heart is the ten elders of He County.

400
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,820
Do you have the guts to say that again?

401
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,820
Don't do it again.

402
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Do it again.

403
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,820
Don't do it again.

404
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Don't do it again.

405
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,820
Don't do it again.

406
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Don't do it again.

407
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,820
Don't do it again.

408
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,820
Please.

409
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,820
Don't do it again.

410
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,820
Your Majesty, the North's traitors have come to us.

411
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,820
They will raise a new wave of bloodshed.

412
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,820
You are guilty of treason

413
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,820
You are accused of colluding with the enemy

414
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,820
No, no, father

415
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,820
Treason is a death sentence

416
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
I...

417
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
You opened the gate and let the traitors in

418
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,820
Don't you know it's a death sentence?

419
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,820
I know I was wrong

420
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Father, please spare me

421
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Master

422
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Please stop the case

423
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
I have already lost my father

424
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,820
I am guilty of treason

425
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Master

426
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
Dong Guang

427
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
I ask you

428
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,820
How many people know this except Princess Li Cheng?

429
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
Wang Yao He

430
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
What are you doing?

431
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Open the gate

432
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
I am just following orders

433
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Young Lord, please be patient

434
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
What's going on?

435
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,820
It seems that we are trapped by the enemy

436
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Have you really talked to the North?

437
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Yes

438
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,820
There is a military counselor in the North

439
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,820
He is the most suspicious

440
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
He is the most suspicious

441
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Then take my seal

442
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Tell him

443
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,820
I can give him the map and military force of the He County

444
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,820
I can also give him 100,000 bags of grain

445
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,820
50,000 silver and 50,000 pieces of jade

446
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,820
The condition is that they have to win a few battles first

447
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,820
Then find a place to defeat me

448
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,820
As for the last

449
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,820
They are willing to return to the North or continue to fight the five states

450
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,820
I don't care

451
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,820
As long as the Great Sheng is betrayed, father will be able to regain the people's hearts

452
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,820
This is

453
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
This is me

454
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Can I still be the Crown Prince?

455
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
What do you think?

456
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
What do you think?

457
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,820
Li Tongguang and Princess Li Cheng

458
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,820
And all the people who know about this

459
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Have been trapped by me

460
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,820
But before the ceremony is held

461
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,820
I have to send out the Prime Minister to send out the troops

462
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,820
I have to lift him high

463
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,820
The more he is defeated, the more he can hold out until the end of the war

464
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Your Highness

465
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,820
Even if it's not delicious

466
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,820
You have to eat more for your recovery

467
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,820
I don't need it anymore

468
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Your Highness hasn't used much in the past few days

469
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,820
The food sent by the people of the Anguo is getting more and more shallow

470
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
I'm fine

471
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
I'm still young and can bear it

472
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
You should eat

473
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,820
Otherwise, Gu will be angry

474
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,820
By the way

475
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
How is the Qing Dynasty?

476
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,820
He is young and has a bad temper

477
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,820
I'm still a little worried about him

478
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,820
He doesn't talk and always stumbles

479
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,820
I asked him the other day

480
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
He knows martial arts

481
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Why didn't he run out of the wall?

482
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,820
He just stood up and pointed at the swordsmen

483
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,820
He turned around and left

484
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
What kind of prime minister do you want to be?

485
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Brother Yuanzhou really looks up to him

486
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
Your Highness

487
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,820
The Qing Dynasty has two kinds of glory

488
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,820
One is the royal identity of the eldest princess

489
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Two is her husband

490
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Now, brother An took back his military power and put him in a trap

491
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,820
What can he do if he escapes?

492
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,820
Can't you just wander around the world as a citizen?

493
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,820
It's better to stay and see what the opportunity is

494
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,820
After all, I didn't commit any death

495
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
What's wrong with you?

496
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,820
What's wrong with you?

497
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,820
I haven't eaten well recently

498
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,820
I'm sorry

499
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,820
I haven't had hot water these days

500
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
And I forced you to eat these cold dishes

501
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Wait, I'll get it for you

502
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Your Highness

503
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,820
Tang Guang

504
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
What happened to Ren Xin last time

505
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
made me very embarrassed

506
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,820
The Great Hall is in danger

507
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,820
If something goes wrong again

508
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,820
What do you think of me?

509
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
I'm tired

510
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,820
Brother An

511
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
I'm sorry

512
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
I'm sorry

513
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
Why did you pour my water?

514
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
You don't want to live anymore?

515
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
You dare to burn the monsoon grass?

516
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
This grass is poisonous

517
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,820
We don't have this kind of grass in Jiangnan

518
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,820
I just saw a bucket of grass dried up

519
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
I just took it over

520
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
If this grass is poisonous

521
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Can we find more of them

522
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,820
and make the guards outside faint?

523
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,820
What did the masters teach you?

524
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,820
This palace is so big

525
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,820
How many monsoon grass do you want to burn?

526
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,820
The masters only taught me not to sit and wait for the rain

527
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
You lost the army of rain

528
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,820
But you still have the fief

529
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,820
If we can escape

530
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Okay, okay, okay

531
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
I won't say it

532
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:54,820
Your brother will actually make water

533
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,820
My mother was crazy about a talented woman

534
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
In the winter in Jiangnan

535
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,820
I can freeze to death

536
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,820
If you think I won't be like this in the cold palace

537
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
How long can I live?

538
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,820
I'm not going to die

539
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,820
I'm going to die

540
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,820
I'm going to die

541
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,820
I'm going to die

542
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
I'm going to die

543
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,820
How long can I live?

544
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,820
When I was a kid

545
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
I also often played the flute

546
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
You have an emperor's father

547
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,820
I don't even have a father

548
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,820
Are you comforting me?

549
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,820
This taro is considered a crab

550
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
Cooked, roasted, fragrant

551
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
Half for each

552
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,820
Here you go

553
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,820
Okay

554
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
If the master knows

555
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,820
I can send him to the Qingyun Sword to cut the taro

556
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
I don't know what he will think

557
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
He won't care

558
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
This sword is called Qingyun

559
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
What's wrong?

560
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
I know a person

561
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,820
Also called Qingyun

562
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,820
I hope your ending can be better than him

563
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
That person is your Qilang

564
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,820
Aren't you the one who is waiting for the long road?

565
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
Can't I?

566
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Who said women can only fall in love with one man in their whole life?

567
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Do we women have to write the same as the play?

568
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
No matter who you meet

569
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,820
You only deserve to be in love with one person?

570
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,820
And me and Yuan Lu are not like what you think

571
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,820
Okay

572
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,820
Anyway

573
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,820
I will only love my master in my whole life

574
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,820
One person

575
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,820
Life is long

576
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,820
Who knows what will happen in the future?

577
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
But

578
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
I still have to thank you

579
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,820
After Yuan Lu's accident

580
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,820
You helped me arrange Yuan Lu's funeral and the offering of the Buddha

581
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,820
You are welcome

582
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
Instead of sharing it

583
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,820
Why don't you think about my uncle, Andy

584
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,820
What will he do to you in the future?

585
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,820
Li Zhenye colluded with the Northern States

586
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
I will never be his crown princess

587
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,820
I will never be his crown princess

588
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Actually

589
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,820
I have always been in contact with the six Daoist churches

590
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
If they find out that I was trapped

591
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
They will come to save me

592
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
I believe that Brother Yuan Zhou and Sister Ru Yi

593
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
Once they know the news

594
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
They will never leave us alone

595
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,820
I will never leave you alone

596
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
I will never leave you alone

597
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
The water is hot

598
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
Do you want to drink some?

599
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,820
No

600
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
Who are you?

601
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
Don't move

602
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
I am here to save you

603
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
Chu Yue

604
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,820
I am really here to save you

605
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
What happened?

606
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
My father and my brother

607
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,820
Have started to help Hexian

608
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,820
But they think that everything is wrong

609
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
The army sent too little food

610
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Although the supply is enough

611
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
But there is only 40% of the sword

612
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
My father thinks

613
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,820
The emperor doesn't want to fight against the Northern States

614
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,820
So he sent me to pay attention to the situation in the capital

615
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
But this morning

616
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
Ren Ru Yi and Ning Yuan Zhou

617
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Have appeared in my house

618
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
What?

619
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
My master went to find you?

620
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,820
It's true

621
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Ren Ru Yi said

622
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
Your sword is called Qing Yun

623
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,820
He gave it to you in the church

624
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,820
It was originally for the empress

625
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,820
Ning Yuan Zhou said

626
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
His mother's surname is Gu

627
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
She is your daughter-in-law

628
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
She gave you from the age of three to seven

629
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
It's really them

630
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
You continue

631
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
The six Daoist churches they received on the way

632
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,820
And the news of the Golden Sand Tower

633
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,820
So I came to Andu all the way

634
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,820
I caught Li Zhen Ye's interrogation

635
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,820
I didn't know you were imprisoned here

636
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,820
The guards here are from the Sha Xi Department

637
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
They asked me to save you

638
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,820
You are not familiar with them

639
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,820
Why?

640
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,820
Because Ning Yuan Zhou said

641
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,820
His Majesty is secretly contacting the Northern States

642
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
Want to sell my father

643
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,820
He wants my father to be defeated by the Northern States

644
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
And then he will take the bones of the Sha Xi Department

645
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,820
And win a big victory

646
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
So he can cover all the grudges

647
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,820
And stabilize his military power

648
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,820
I knew it

649
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
There will be a big mess after the ceremony

650
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
Not much time left

651
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,820
Li Zhu Xiang, change the guard

652
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,820
You have to change your clothes

653
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,820
The people of the six Daoist churches are also at the door

654
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,820
To welcome you

655
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
We have someone to welcome

656
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
It will be safe after going out

657
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,820
Maybe you need this more than me

658
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,820
This is from Brother Yuan Zhou

659
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
There will be a small needle here

660
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
The needle will be clouded immediately

661
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,820
You keep the body guard

662
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,820
Thank you

663
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,820
Your Highness

664
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,820
Take care

665
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,820
Stop

666
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
Although they are the army of the United States

667
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
They have never been on the battlefield

668
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,820
I lend you all the money

669
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
You take them to save my brother A'Dian first

670
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,820
Why did you say just now

671
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,820
There will be a big mess after the ceremony

672
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,820
Where are Ning Yuan Zhou and the others

673
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,820
Ren Ru Yi and Ning Yuan Zhou

674
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,820
Will be in front of the officials at the ceremony

675
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,820
To expose the crimes of the emperor and Li Zhen Ye

676
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,820
By forcing him to make a move

677
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,820
To lead the court to rebel against the rebels

678
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,820
I'm afraid they might fail

679
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,820
So I hope you

680
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,820
Fail

681
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Why do you think they will fail

682
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,820
Because they don't look very good

683
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,820
They are both

684
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,820
They are both in Andu after riding the horse for several days

685
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Ren Ru Yi has an old injury

686
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Ning Yuan Zhou's internal force seems to be stable

687
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
How is my master now

688
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,820
He is still in good spirits

689
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,820
Four or five of our guards

690
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,820
It's not his opponent to add up

691
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,820
It's just him

692
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,820
Stop talking

693
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,820
You let me save your father, right

694
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,820
Then let me take fifty Sha Xi Bu guards first

695
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,820
What do you want

696
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,820
God bless

697
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,820
By the will of the gods

698
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,820
I hereby declare

699
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,820
Li Zhen Ye, the second son of the emperor

700
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,820
The emperor is kind and kind

701
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
He is loyal and faithful

702
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,820
Therefore

703
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,820
I hereby appoint Li Zhen Ye, the second son of the emperor

704
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,820
As the crown prince

705
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,820
To help the Qing Dynasty

706
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,820
To be a good example

707
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,820
To help the Qing Dynasty

708
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,820
To be a good example

709
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,820
To tell Xia Er

710
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,820
To tell Xia Er

711
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,820
I hereby appoint

712
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,820
Long live the emperor

713
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,820
Long live the crown prince

714
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,820
The emperor is loyal and faithful

715
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,820
If you don't want me to break his neck

716
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Don't touch them

717
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,820
Don't move!

718
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,820
Human heart?

719
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,820
Human heart?

720
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,820
Human heart?

721
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,820
Human heart?

722
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,820
Human heart?

723
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,820
Human heart?
