00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

8
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

9
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

10
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

11
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

12
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

13
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

14
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

15
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I am sorry, I am sorry

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They must be very anxious

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your Royal Highness

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can go

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But before you go

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Look at this

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is the one that Sun Lang stabbed me last night

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I almost hurt my heart

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was afraid you would be worried

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't tell you

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You don't believe me

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and blame me

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I see

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's so deep, does it hurt?

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm a lowly person

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can afford it

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your Highness, please take care of me

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's my fault

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was too anxious just now, I was blamed

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But I can't leave everyone alone

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I know

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you are in a difficult situation

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But Your Highness, have you ever thought

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that there is no Golden Wolf

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even if you rush back

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
what can you take to redeem yourself?

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Your Highness

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But even so

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I have to go to the kingdom of An to bring back the emperor

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is the responsibility of the royal family

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is the responsibility of the royal family

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is not your responsibility

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
On the way

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The people of the delegation often tell you

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the big story of the kingdom

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But you are just a princess born in the cold palace

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and not familiar with the world

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What military affairs

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
have nothing to do with you

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm the only one who really cares about you in this world

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ayi, look at my eyes

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you want to be my wife?

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Turn around

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or shake it

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hurry up

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Great

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Great

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Great

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Ayi, I have never lived so fast in my life

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Me too

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I Zheng Qingyun

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
swear to God

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will never betray Yangyang in this life

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If it is this wish, the sky will be great

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Great

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ayi

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't be afraid

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's be together, okay?

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I will be good to you

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
When did you learn martial arts?

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't worry

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Qingyun, this is not right

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I am willing to marry you

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It must be fair and square

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go back

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
At least we can talk about marriage

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
when we are safe

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ayi

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why are you still here?

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We finally escaped

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ayi, you have to be careful

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I will be good to you

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Qingyun, calm down

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Qingyun

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Bastard

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yuan Lu

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your Highness, I am late

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's okay, how did you turn around?

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The fire is everywhere

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I am responsible for this

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Bastard, how dare you explain to His Highness

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I...

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't move

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let go of Qingyun

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
She didn't explain to me

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You are sick again

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Where is your pill?

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I have finished my pill, Yuan Lu

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hurry

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yuan Lu

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your Highness

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yuan Lu

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let me go

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yuan Lu

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let me go

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yuan Lu

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yuan Lu, what are you doing?

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let me go

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yuan Lu

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yuan Lu

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yuan Lu

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yuan Lu, wait for me

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let me go

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let me go

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let me go

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let me go

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let me go

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let me go

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let me go

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ayi

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yuan Lu

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ayi

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let me go

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Ayi, calm down

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I won't hurt you

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But you killed Yuan Lu

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He did it first

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I just want to protect myself

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
In your heart, he is more important than me

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The people of the delegation will soon be in charge of the body

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They will definitely decide

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You don't want to go to Angu

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's why you colluded with me to kill people

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ayi, things have come to this

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you don't discuss with me

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You dragged me out and killed Yuan Lu

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You turned me into a traitor

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Is this what you say to me?

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Qi Yue

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You are wrong

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You are wrong

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You were always gentle in the palace

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You did everything for me

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You listened to me

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But now

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Because I don't worry about you, Ayi

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I am still the princess of Wu Guo

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I am Li Wang of Wu Guo

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I am going back to save Yuan Lu

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to explain to everyone clearly

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Deng Qingyun

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you really want to be with me

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't stop me

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Step back

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Brother Yuan Zhuang

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Go

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,480
Lehe

171
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
Thenopt

172
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,640
That's good.

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's not kill him first.

174
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,680
The gold must be related to him.

175
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,400
You or me?

176
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,080
Let me do it.

177
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,520
It's none of your business.

178
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,320
It's not convenient for you.

179
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,600
Yuan Shu, don't kill him.

180
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,160
A Yan.

181
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,320
Don't kill him.

182
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,200
A Yan, save me.

183
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
Your Highness, save me.

184
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,000
If you still think he is innocent,

185
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,360
or you want to plead for him,

186
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,800
I think

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm a fool.

188
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,600
A Yan, tell me.

189
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,000
You're willing to leave the delegation with him, right?

190
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,800
And,

191
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,440
is Yuan Lu injured?

192
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
He said the bandits came to attack.

193
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,640
So I ran away with him.

194
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
I woke up and wanted to go back to the delegation.

195
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,360
But he didn't let me.

196
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,840
Yuan Lu chased after me.

197
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
So he hurt Yuan Lu.

198
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,600
A Yan.

199
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,640
You promised to elope with me.

200
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,640
Yuan Lu.

201
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Let me go.

202
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
Let me go.

203
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,480
A Yan.

204
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,800
A Yan, save me.

205
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,600
A Yan.

206
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,640
Qing Yun.

207
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,400
A Yan.

208
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,400
Ru Yi.

209
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,720
Take A Yan back.

210
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,880
He can't stand it.

211
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,960
A Yan.

212
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,000
A Yan, don't go.

213
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,680
He will kill me.

214
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,880
A Yan.

215
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,680
Brother Yuan Zhuang.

216
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,640
I just beg you not to kill him.

217
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
He did everything for me.

218
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,440
Get up.

219
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,400
You're the king of a country.

220
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,160
You can be the king of the country, the king of the country.

221
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,840
But you can't die for such a despicable man.

222
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,600
Xu Le.

223
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,760
Let's go.

224
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,600
No matter what Brother Yuan Zhuang asks you,

225
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,200
you should be honest.

226
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,040
He won't love you.

227
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,320
A Yan.

228
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,560
You happiness comes.

229
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,680
You should watch me die?

230
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I...

231
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Speak.

232
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Who taught you to do this?

233
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Where is the gold?

234
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Why did you seduce His Highness?

235
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I didn't seduce His Highness.

236
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
No one taught me.

237
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I won't repeat the same words.

238
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
A-Yang!

239
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
A-Yang!

240
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
A-Yang!

241
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
A-Yang, save me!

242
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Save me! I'm sincere!

243
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
He wants to kill you with a sword.

244
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
It's better to find out the truth earlier.

245
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Sometimes the truth is worse than the question.

246
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
You're too slow.

248
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Yuan Lu is waiting for the doctor.

249
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
One, here.

250
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Two, here.

251
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Three, here.

252
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
No fourth.

253
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I said...

254
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
I said...

255
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
The bandits stole the gold.

256
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm in charge of taking away His Highness.

257
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
It's not appropriate!

258
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I really don't know where they are now.

259
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I just met them three days later.

260
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
You're on the same side with the bandits?

261
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Who taught you to do this?

262
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Prince Dan Yang or the Empress?

263
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Prince Dan Yang.

264
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
He told me not to take any risks.

265
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
To stop the princess from going to Angu.

266
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
He's the Prince Regent.

268
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I can only follow orders.

269
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
But why didn't you tell me?

270
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Why did you lie to me and want to kill me?

271
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
I didn't, A-Yang!

272
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I didn't!

273
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
I just wanted to hurt you so you couldn't go back.

274
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I really had no choice.

275
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
But my love for you...

276
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
You still want to get him?

277
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,880
That's why you split up with the bandits and the others.

278
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Do you think that...

279
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
As long as he becomes your woman...

280
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
He will listen to you?

281
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Even if he knows the truth...

282
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
He won't blame you.

283
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Am I right?

284
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Tell me!

285
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Tell me!

286
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Am I right?

287
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
A-Yang.

288
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Aren't you thinking about marrying me?

289
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Then why are you so different?

290
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,880
You came to Angu for my woman and man.

291
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I have to do something for you.

292
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
A-Yang.

293
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I don't want you to suffer.

294
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I don't want you to die.

295
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
The King of Danyang found out about us.

296
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
He's willing to give me a chance.

297
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I have to take it well.

298
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
A-Yang.

299
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Tell them to let me go.

300
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,880
What did the King of Danyang find out about you?

301
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Is it Chengzhao?

302
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Is it Jia Guan or Jingjue?

303
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Vice-President.

304
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
According to the rules...

305
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
I can also meet a loyal general.

306
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Good.

307
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
General.

308
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Did you hear that, Yanzhou?

309
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
As long as he can fool me...

310
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
and fool me into obeying him...

311
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,880
he'll be a loyal general like you who's been sick for more than ten years.

312
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
It's so interesting.

313
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
It's so worth it.

314
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
A-Yang.

315
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
You go back first.

316
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm fine.

317
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Ru Yi.

318
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Let's go.

319
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
A-Yang, don't go.

320
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Brother Yanzhou.

321
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
He's in your hands.

322
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
A-Yang, don't go.

323
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
You can't go.

324
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm your man.

325
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
How dare you leave me alone?

326
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Yang Yang, you're so heartless.

327
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
What did you say?

328
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
I said you're heartless and brainless.

329
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
I'm your man.

330
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
How could you come to harm me with them?

331
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,880
You're just a poor little thing in the Cold Palace.

332
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Who's good to you?

333
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Who's been nice to you?

334
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Even you.

335
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
You've forgotten everything.

336
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Yang Yang.

337
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
You're heartless.

338
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
You're heartless and brainless.

339
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Brother Yanzhou.

340
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Let him finish.

341
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
You're fighting with me now.

342
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
You're trying to be a king in front of me.

343
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,880
You forgot how ugly you were in the Cold Palace.

344
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Did you see that?

345
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
You're so short.

346
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
You're like a bean sprout.

347
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,880
Even a maid can be so rude to you.

348
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
For the dessert in the Imperial Kitchen,

349
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
you're so mean to my brother.

350
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
If you didn't have a princess's name,

351
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
I wouldn't care about you.

352
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
You said you wanted to marry me.

353
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Fine, I'll wait.

354
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
For three years, I was just a guard.

355
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
I didn't mean to be mean to you.

356
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Ignore her.

357
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Yang Yang.

358
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Remember.

359
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
I've rubbed your whole body.

360
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
You're mine now.

361
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Even if you go back with them,

362
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
they'll still look down on you.

363
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I didn't.

364
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
I didn't.

365
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Right?

366
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Tell me.

367
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Tell me.

368
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
I didn't.

369
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
I didn't.

370
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Zhen Xinyu.

371
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Wenra, kill him.

372
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
You're dead.

373
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
No one will look down on me.

374
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I didn't do it on purpose.

375
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
You lied to me.

376
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
You ruined Yuan Luo.

377
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
You ruined the whole troupe.

378
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Luo Yijian.

379
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
You're right.

380
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I'm such a fool.

381
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I was tricked into a troupe for such a man.

382
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
I didn't even want to die for him.

383
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Say something.

384
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Say something.

385
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Say something.

386
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
You're such a liar.

387
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
You're a liar.

388
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Go find someone to repair the door and the wall.

391
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
Yes.

392
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
I've searched everything.

393
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Nothing useful.

394
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
They're the bandits from the Earth Temple.

395
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Zhen Qingyun hurt Sun Lang with their help.

396
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Zhen Qingyun shouldn't have lied.

397
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,880
The skin behind these people is very delicate.

398
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Unlike the locals nearby,

399
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,880
they should be the subordinates of the King of Dayang.

400
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
They're not the bandits.

401
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
They're the locals nearby.

402
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
They should be the subordinates of the King of Dayang.

403
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Before you left, tell me to keep an eye on the troupe.

404
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I didn't protect you and lost the gold.

405
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
It's my fault.

406
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
All right.

407
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Shisan, you should get up.

408
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
It's my fault.

409
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,880
I was too kind and delayed on the way.

410
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
That's why this happened.

411
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
As long as you're doing something,

412
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
something unexpected will happen.

413
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
They're trying to avoid you from being ambushed.

414
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
It's a good thing to avoid.

415
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
It's normal to avoid.

416
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Instead of making a mistake here,

417
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,880
you should get the gold back as soon as possible.

418
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,880
And we must get the gold back before the people in Angu find out.

419
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Otherwise, the peace talks will be in chaos.

420
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Where did you lose the gold?

422
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
In the cliff outside Sanli.

423
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
I and Qian chased after it.

424
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
But they were prepared.

425
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
They pushed the car with the gold down the cliff.

426
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
And they were tied up.

427
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
We went around the cliff and reached the bottom of the cliff.

428
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
The gold and people were gone.

429
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
After we found the troops,

430
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,880
we chased after eight people who were not injured.

431
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
But we haven't found them yet.

432
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Eight people are scattered.

433
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
We don't have enough people.

434
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Let's call them back.

435
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
We'll make a plan.

436
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Okay.

437
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Among the people you sent,

438
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,880
only Yuan Lu from the southeast met you.

439
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Ning Yuan Zhou and I came from the south.

440
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
We happened to meet the horse on Yuan Lu's way.

441
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Then we knew something must have happened.

442
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Since Zheng Qingyun and the bandits are divided into two ways,

443
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,880
the bandits will not go to the southeast and the southeast.

444
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
They will meet in Tang's town three days later.

445
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,880
The horse on both sides can't go around a big circle.

446
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
So the east and the southwest can be ruled out.

447
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
The cliff is on the north side.

448
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,880
So the most likely direction is the northwest, northwest and northeast.

449
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
That's right.

450
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
First,

451
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
they hurriedly transported the gold out.

452
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
They won't go on the mountain road.

453
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Second,

454
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
no matter how many roads they divided,

455
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
for safety,

456
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
the gold will not be transported separately.

457
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
So this group of people

458
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
must have at least 20 people.

459
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Third,

460
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,880
this is not the territory of King Dayan.

461
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
He is also afraid that the gold will fall into the hands of the security.

462
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,880
So they will avoid

463
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,880
the large and large roads and the small roads.

464
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
According to the above clues,

465
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,880
we only need to find 20 people on the small road.

466
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Then we can find something.

467
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Then I'll go to the capital city immediately.

468
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Find the map of this area.

469
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
No need.

470
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
I'll go to the capital city.

471
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Here, here, and here.

472
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Three villages, four roads,

473
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
separate the lines.

474
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Okay.

475
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
We'll go to the capital city immediately.

476
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Okay.

477
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
Let's go.

478
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
Wait.

479
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
You haven't recovered yet, so don't go.

480
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I need you to stay here.

481
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
I'll go to the capital city.

482
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
I'll go to the capital city.

483
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
I'll go to the capital city.

484
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
I'll go to the capital city.

485
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I'll go to the capital city.

486
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
I need you to stay here.

487
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Help me look after His Highness and Yuan Lu.

488
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Now the time is short.

489
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
We can't say anything else.

490
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
You've passed through the Golden Temple alone.

491
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Next, it's our six Taoists' turn to show off.

492
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Be careful.

493
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Uncle, have you seen 20 people passing through here?

494
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Yes, I have.

495
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Let's go that way.

496
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Let's go.

497
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Okay.

498
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Ladies, where is Zhi Wang?

499
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
You're so bold.

500
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
You're sisters.

501
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I thought you were a young lady.

502
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
What's wrong with you?

503
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Foreigners?

504
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Yes.

505
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
Stay here tonight.

506
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
I have a good idea.

507
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
But I have something to do.

508
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Have you seen 20 people passing through here?

509
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Yes.

510
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Let's go that way.

511
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Yes, that way.

512
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Okay.

513
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
After I finish my work,

514
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I'll stay here tonight

515
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
to have a meal with you.

516
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
The whole He County is closed to the public.

517
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Only your family can stay in the inn with more than 20 people.

518
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
You can't tell anyone else.

519
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
It's okay.

520
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
I'll give you two choices.

521
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
You choose.

522
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I saw more than 20 people.

523
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
It's a big box.

524
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
It looks heavy.

525
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
They went that way.

526
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Okay, thank you.

527
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Let's go.

528
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Go.

529
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Go.

530
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
How's it going?

531
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
I've checked.

532
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Two hours ago,

533
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
two teams of people

534
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
passed through this crossroad.

535
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
They all have the same number as the escort.

536
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
They are all in the same car,

537
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
with more than 30 people.

538
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
But one team

539
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
went this way.

540
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
The other team

541
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
went this way.

542
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
This is the way to Tuoling Town.

543
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
This is the way to the crossing.

544
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
It's a two-way road.

545
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
It's too troublesome to go two ways.

546
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
We still have to check the crossroad.

547
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
The depth of the two crossroads is similar.

548
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
We still have to calculate

549
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
which side of the goods will be heavier.

550
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Tao.

551
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
You're good.

552
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
You saved another life.

553
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Tao.

554
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
How's it going?

555
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
We're in good shape.

556
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Now,

557
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
we can kill a cow.

558
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
The original road is good.

559
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Check the heat-saving mark.

560
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Help us to calculate

561
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
which side of the goods will be heavier.

562
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
No problem, Tao.

563
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Slow down.

564
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
Tao.

565
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
The distance between the two roads

566
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
is only two kilometers.

567
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
They should be in the same direction.

568
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Tao.

569
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Tao.

570
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Tao.

571
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Tao.

572
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
Tao.

573
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Tao.

574
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Tao.

575
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Tao.

576
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Tao.

577
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Tao.

578
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Tao.

579
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Tao.

580
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
Tao.

581
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
Tao.

582
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Tao.

583
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Tao.

584
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
Tao.

585
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
Tao.

586
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Tao.

587
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
Tao.

588
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Tao.

589
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,480
But I can't tell which way is the gold.

590
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,840
But I can tell that this is the way.

591
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,080
Why?

592
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,800
Because the horse hoof print on this road is different from others.

593
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,520
The pattern on the print is made by the manager.

594
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,120
Only the manager's high-end goods will be used often.

595
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,640
It should be this way.

596
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,400
This direction is the capital.

597
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,280
They passed here two hours ago.

598
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,680
Maybe they have already gone down the river.

599
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,800
Let's go to the downstream.

600
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Okay.

601
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Yuan Lu, go back and rest.

602
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
We'll go after them.

603
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Yes, go back and rest.

604
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Let's go.

605
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Hurry up!

606
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Hurry up!

607
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I haven't eaten yet.

608
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Pull!

609
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Come on!

610
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Let's go!

611
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
It's great.

612
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
We've got everything back.

613
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Thanks to you, Mr. Ning.

614
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
You're welcome, Mr. Du.

615
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
This is my duty.

616
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
How is His Highness?

617
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
His Highness is still in high fever.

618
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,680
But the doctor and Miss Ruyi are with him.

619
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,680
Okay, I'll go and see them.

620
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
By the way,

621
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
I've got a message for you.

622
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
What is it?

623
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,680
I've got a message for you.

624
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Okay, I'll go and see them.

625
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
By the way,

626
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,680
General Wu from the He County of An State came to ask

627
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
what happened last night.

628
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,680
I found a reason to go there.

629
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Thank you, Mr. Du.

630
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Your Highness, wake up.

631
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
You should take some medicine.

632
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
I'll do it.

633
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
You can leave.

634
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
Yes.

635
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
How is it?

636
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
It's just a man's heart.

637
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
He can't die.

638
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
But he needs to be skinned.

639
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
I've already interrogated the bandits.

640
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,680
He said that the King of Dayang didn't want to kill Ying.

641
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,680
He just wanted to stop him from going to An State.

642
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,680
He didn't make a promise to the Prince Consort with Zheng Qingyun.

643
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Zheng Qingyun was too anxious

644
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
and bought some bandits

645
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,680
to make a living.

646
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,680
It seems that the King of Dayang is kind.

647
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I'm sorry.

648
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
I'm sorry.

649
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
The King of Dayang is kind.

650
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,680
In fact, whether it's Zhang Song or the King of Dayang,

651
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,680
they all have to be more powerful than our Emperor.

652
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
You can just not save Wu Di.

653
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
What Zhang Song wants is

654
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,680
a memorial to the son of the Empress.

655
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,680
I don't believe that Wu Di would dare not write a memorial under the sword.

656
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
No.

657
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Because the brothers of the Heavenly Law are innocent,

658
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,680
he has to rely on him to prove to the world.

659
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,680
The throne only needs the imperial decree.

660
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Why does Zheng Qingyun need to prove it himself?

661
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Because people usually hear

662
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,680
more powerful words than words.

663
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
But you're right.

664
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
Zheng Qingyun is a trouble.

665
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
He will solve it sooner or later.

666
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,680
It's better to let Ying see his true face earlier.

667
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,680
It's good for him to decide to go to An State sooner.

668
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,680
He's stronger than we thought.

669
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,680
If you dare to become Zheng Qingyun,

670
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
I will definitely not kill you with a few stabs.

671
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,680
I will definitely knock you down.

672
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
I will make you drag for several months.

673
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,680
I can't live or die.

674
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Don't worry.

675
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,680
I will definitely not become Zheng Qingyun.

676
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
But

677
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm curious about

678
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,680
how you can make me live or die.

679
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
You're trying to humiliate me.

680
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
So what?

681
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I'm not humiliating you.

682
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Do I have to humiliate others?

683
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
You dare?

684
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
Of course not.

685
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
I'm sorry.

686
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
I was thinking

687
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
we were together just now.

688
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,680
I wanted to take you out for a walk.

689
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,680
You can see the flowers or birds.

690
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,680
But I didn't expect to encounter so many things.

691
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
It's a pity.

692
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
It's nothing.

693
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,680
I don't like flowers anyway.

694
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Besides,

695
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,680
you left the delegation because you were worried about me.

696
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
You will like it in the future.

697
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,680
After we finish this mission,

698
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
I will take you to a place

699
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
where there is only the two of us.

700
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,680
We can plant flowers together,

701
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,680
cut firewood together, cook together,

702
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
and fish together.

703
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Anyway,

704
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,680
we will do everything together.

705
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
You will like it.

706
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Why are you so arrogant?

707
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
I'm arrogant

708
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
but only to you.

709
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,680
But I still like to fight with you.

710
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
We are fighting side by side now.

711
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Ning, are you awake?

712
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Is it not the right time?

713
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
What?

714
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
You are still awake?

715
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
An's soldiers know that you are sick.

716
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,680
They have brought the gifts to visit me.

717
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Okay.

718
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Let Mr. Du deal with it.

719
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
No.

720
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
This time,

721
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
it's not a general from He County.

722
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
It's the order of the Emperor of An.

723
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
The order of the Emperor of An

724
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
has come from An City

725
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
to receive the seal of our delegation.

726
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,680
There is also the Red Roof Temple.

727
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
It doesn't matter.

728
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Mr. Du said that

729
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
the seal of the delegation

730
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
is the same level

731
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
as the seal of the Emperor of Ying.

732
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
It must be received by His Highness.

733
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Mr. Du, you are welcome.

734
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
King Li of the Republic of China

735
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
has been killed by bandits

736
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,680
in the capital of our country.

737
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,680
The one who speaks is the Red Roof Temple's Shao Qing.

738
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,680
The one next to it is the Jin Temple.

739
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,680
This Jin Temple

740
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,680
is much higher than the Shao Qing.

741
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
In the words of Shao Qing,

742
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
he always obeys him.

743
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
We are the same.

744
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Since His Highness is sick,

745
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,680
how can he not follow the principle of the chief?

746
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Recently, I heard a rumor

747
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
that King Li of the Republic of China

748
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
was greedy and afraid of death.

749
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
He dared not to come to our country

750
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
and has already fled privately.

751
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,680
I didn't believe it at first.

752
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,680
But the chief of the Jin Temple came to visit.

753
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,680
But you all objected.

754
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Is there anything wrong with it?

755
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
You are so rude.

756
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
Why don't you let him see His Highness?

757
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,680
His Highness is my prince.

758
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
We are with him anyway.

759
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
There will be no problem.

760
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,680
No.

761
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
If he brings Ming Yi here,

762
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,680
His Highness will be a man and a woman.

763
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
He will know it later.

764
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Find a way

765
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,680
to keep them away from His Highness.

766
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
You go in and drag them out first.

767
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,680
Follow me.

768
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
Today, Wu Dong

769
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680

770
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680

774
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,680
somebody will know the truth.

775

776
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,720

777
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,820

I'm here to aren't quiet anymore.

779
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,620
You haven't finally met your real owner.

781
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,040
Hao Chen,

782
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,200
you dare not talk to me for me?

783
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,300
Don't lie to me!

784
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,940
That's what I tell you.

785
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,300

786
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,000

Are you the one who really made the decision?

788
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,000
You should know that

789
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,400
I'm not as good as Prince Li.

790
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,480
If Prince Li doesn't want to see me,

791
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,960
it means he's rude to me.

792
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,760
So what?

793
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,120
You can bring me in.

794
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,160
Or

795
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,960
I can go in myself.

796
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,080
I'm sorry.

797
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,240
How dare you?

798
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,640
Prince Li is not well.

799
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

800
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,560
Since you want to visit His Highness,

801
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
I'll take you in.

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,200

803
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,160
please take a deep breath.

804
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,200
Otherwise, you'll be disturbed by the rest and get sick.

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,480
I think you'll be unhappy, too.

806
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,440
Okay.

00:45:52,920 --> 00:46:08,880
After this date

811
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,720
He already knows

812
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:18,660
Tay is having sex

813
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,940
The blood is falling

814
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,620
Who wants to be separated from the world

815
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,180
The sky is scattered like water

816
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,100
Looking back at the past

817
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:37,340
The world is cold

818
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,820
Who will stay with me for the rest of my life

819
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:47,420
Who is worried about the heartless

820
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:53,820
Who hopes that a dream will become a wind

821
00:47:53,820 --> 00:48:02,820
How many years have passed since the world has fallen

822
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:10,900
I have no one to spend the rest of my life with

823
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:26,420
I have no one to spend the rest of my life with
