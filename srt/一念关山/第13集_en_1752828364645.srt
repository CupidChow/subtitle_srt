1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,160
We will never forget each other

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
We are still together

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The past days are still like a dream

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,120
When the time comes, we will suddenly exchange our hands

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,000
How are you?

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The Legend of Chusen

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,800
Lord Ning, such a light punishment, how can we help?

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
It's my fault.

9
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,320
The reason why all this happened is because I was behind the back and didn't give proper instructions.

10
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
I didn't prepare the terrain in advance.

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,720
So I would rather be a soldier.

12
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,120
But the single-man heart is really fast.

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,720
The journey of the second-to-the-start city

14
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
You are watching the one-year-old mountain

15
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,520
The royal family of Shuangyan River, the beauty of Sujia'er

16
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,720
You are watching the one-year-old mountain

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
There is a symptom

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
999 cold

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Warm and very considerate

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,920
You are watching the one-year-old mountain

21
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,720
The Legend of Chusen

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,520
Lord Jinming, please remember

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,320
Our marriage is the will of the emperor

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,320
No matter how much you don't want to marry

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
How much you look down on me

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,720
I will be your wife in the future

27
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,320
My Rongrong is also your Rongrong

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,520
Did you hear clearly?

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,320
Don't think about it

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,520
The vultures want to eat heaven's meat

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I will not marry you even if I die

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,920
Then you go to die

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,720
How do you want to die?

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,520
I have poison and white forest

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,120
Otherwise I will give it to you now

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,120
I know you hate me

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,320
Don't worry

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
I have never seen you

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,120
But in the future

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,520
It is best to cooperate with each other in face

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
In private

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,320
I have no problem with you

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Otherwise

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I have a thousand and ten thousand ways

45
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
To make you feel uneasy in the second half of your life

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,320
At that time

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Whether it is your father

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,920
Or your angry

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
No one can help you

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
I will help you

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
I will help you

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
No one can help you

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,720
You think I can see you

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
With your attitude

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Why can't you see me?

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
I don't think I can see you

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I think you should go to the other side

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
I have to go

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
I will go

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I will go

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
I will go

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I will go

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
I will go

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
I will go

65
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I will go

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
I will go

67
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I will go

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
I will go

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I will go

70
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Yes

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,520
His mother is from the imperial clan

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
Although he is from Xiang Lang'an

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
But at the root

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,520
There is still some love

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
Qianzhou

76
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,320
You take care of this

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,920
I go to some branching

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
The news from the headquarters is not clear

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,920
Some things have to be discussed in person

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
You haven't recovered yet

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,320
I'll go with you

82
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
Yes, let's go together

83
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
I will go together

84
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,920
Then I will go too

85
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,720
No need

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,920
Why are so many people going?

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,720
There are too many people

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
I can go by myself

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
Shopkeeper

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,420
How was it?

91
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,720
It's okay

92
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:45,280
I bought a little

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,480
come out

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
I saw it when you just arrived at the temple.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
You shouldn't have said that earlier.

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
I was out there helping you to look at the wind for so long.

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,480
You helped me look at the wind more accurately than I could see it.

98
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
You're using me again?

99
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
You're done taking the antidote?

100
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,480
How did you know that I was here to take the antidote?

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
When you were healing me in the car,

102
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
I found that you were having a heart attack.

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
After a while,

104
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,480
it was probably that one of the exorcisms.

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
You're not allowed to follow anyone.

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Could it be that they don't know that you're poisoned?

107
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Yes, I didn't tell them.

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Now, there are still people who are still in the different places

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,480
who are in danger in the Hall of Mental Health.

110
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,480
The sect always sends out the antidote with songs.

111
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
If I tell them that I was poisoned,

112
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm likely to start a conflict with them.

113
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
But now, my main objective

114
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
is to save His Majesty.

115
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
I must trust everyone.

116
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
So...

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
only I know about it?

118
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Yes.

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Only you know.

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
There's a store that makes herbal medicine.

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,200
The food is good.

122
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Do you want to try it?

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,680
Why do you like sweet food so much?

125
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,880
Because my father passed away when I was a kid.

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,520
My mother raised me up.

127
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I was young at that time.

128
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
I had been in school for three years.

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,320
I didn't have a chance to go out.

130
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
And I didn't have a chance to see others.

131
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
But my stepfather came to see me every month.

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,240
So,

133
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,200
at that time,

134
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
the happiness that my stepfather and he brought me

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
was the greatest happiness in my childhood.

136
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,040
Then I'll give you mine.

137
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,000
You eat double meals every time.

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,520
I'll get back what I was short of before.

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,960
Thank you.

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,000
But some things

141
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,720
will never be returned.

142
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,280
I know a child without a father

143
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,720
is afraid of his childhood.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,800
So,

145
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,840
this is one of the reasons

146
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,720
why I rejected you before.

147
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,160
I can teach my child well

148
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
by myself.

149
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
I believe in your martial arts.

150
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
But I don't believe that you can teach your child.

151
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,240
I have taught male disciples

152
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
and princesses.

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,080
No matter boy or girl,

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
I know how to deal with them.

155
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,280
Look.

156
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Your child can be killed by dealing with them.

157
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,640
For example,

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,680
he is like a baby.

159
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,360
What will you do if he doesn't eat milk?

160
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,520
Beat him.

161
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,600
Kneel him down.

162
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,680
If he asks his father

163
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,600
to go out with him,

164
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
will you tell him

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,360
that your mother will go out with you to eat bird's eggs

166
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,280
and go to the dog's nest?

167
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,240
Why can't I go out with him to eat bird's eggs?

168
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,120
Besides,

169
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
I only have a daughter.

170
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,560
I don't have a boy.

171
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,800
Why are you sure

172
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
that you must have a girl?

173
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,000
I have a secret recipe.

174
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,960
What?

175
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,840
When the second prince was ten years old,

176
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,040
Her Highness had a little princess.

177
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
So she found a recipe from the folk.

178
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Although the little princess doesn't believe in the demon,

179
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,080
the recipe must be from the spirit.

180
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,840
You still believe in this?

181
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,760
Yes.

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,400
I believe everything Her Highness said.

183
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,000
And

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,520
she is my only family in the country.

185
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
What about your real parents?

186
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,280
When my mother gave birth to my brother,

187
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,000
my mother didn't even keep it.

188
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,360
My father wanted to get another one.

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,920
He thought I was a burden.

190
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,080
So he sold me to Zhu Yiwei.

191
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,040
He insisted on paying me.

192
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
Guten figured.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,360
You, too.

194
00:10:47,960 --> 00:11:08,960
OK.

195
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,520
How is it?

196
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,640
This is a good spot, right?

197
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,920
Are those wounded soldiers?

198
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,440
Yes.

199
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,240
They're smiling so happily.

200
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,040
The new king of the world,

201
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,440
the new result.

202
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
Actually, for them,

203
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,440
it's already a difficult thing

204
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,600
to live a peaceful life like now.

205
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,120
I remember when I was in the village,

206
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
you said something.

207
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,400
Something loyal.

208
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
When I was in Anguotian Prison,

209
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
there was a senior officer

210
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,680
who was about to be executed.

211
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,840
He said something similar.

212
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
But not as deep as you.

213
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,520
What did he say?

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,000
He said,

215
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
His Majesty is the master,

216
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
and the people are the cattle and horses.

217
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,960
And he and I,

218
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,360
and the officials and Zhu Yiwei,

219
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,680
are the dogs His Majesty used to graze.

220
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
Actually, I was very angry.

221
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,680
Zhu Yiwei was born and died for His Majesty.

222
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
How could he become a dog?

223
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,440
But later I felt

224
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
what he said was reasonable.

225
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,640
His Majesty should know best

226
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,160
how loyal I am to Her Highness.

227
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,760
But he still put me in prison.

228
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,440
He didn't listen to me at all.

229
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,000
So when I escaped from prison,

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,840
I thought I had already

231
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,720
betrayed Zhu Yiwei.

232
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,320
I didn't follow His Majesty's order.

233
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,240
I still remember what the senior officer said.

234
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,680
He said,

235
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,280
if the emperor is unkind,

236
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,480
he should follow his own heart.

237
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,040
And you said something similar.

238
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,760
In fact,

239
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
we don't need to care

240
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,480
what the senior officer said.

241
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,720
We are all human.

242
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,520
We should have our own minds,

243
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,360
our own likes,

244
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,400
our own judgments,

245
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,280
and our own ideals.

246
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,880
And all the things we do now

247
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,840
are what we want.

248
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,320
It's not that someone is holding a whip

249
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
and is lacking us.

250
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,480
Yes.

251
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
So I've been carrying out tasks.

252
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
It seems that

253
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm not the only one

254
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
who wants to be the emperor.

255
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,920
I don't think I like being an assassin.

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But actually I know

257
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
only by not caring about life and death

258
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,280
can we have people on one side.

259
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,200
For example,

260
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,160
the imperial tutor of Fengxiang, Dingnan,

261
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,240
are all people who love war.

262
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Her Highness said

263
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
every time they send troops,

264
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,720
there will be more than

265
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,760
thousands of innocent people's souls.

266
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes.

267
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
So you killed people

268
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,880
to save people

269
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,000
and to return to the roots.

270
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,640
You're right.

271
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm right.

272
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,080
I'll teach you.

273
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,440
My current wish is

274
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,440
to be avenged by Her Highness and Linglong,

275
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,240
and have a child of my own.

276
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,720
Then you'll save Wu Di

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,640
and help your brothers to clear their name.

278
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,360
What else do you want to do?

279
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
I haven't thought about it yet.

280
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,240
Let's talk about it later.

281
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,520
No wonder

282
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,800
I was so reluctant to force you.

283
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,720
It turns out that

284
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,640
you always treat me as a whip.

285
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,080
Then you're willing to do it.

286
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,560
Because you're pretty

287
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
and give me candy.

288
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,320
Oh my and this

289
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
is for you.

290
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,960
Fraud!

291
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,000
My Lord,

292
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
you're finally here.

293
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
You don't have too much money.

294
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,280
I can't bear to be such a big smuggler

295
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,080
I can't do it if you don't watch and pass on the message.

296
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,160
Please sit, My Lord.

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,640
Tell me.

298
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,440
What's the matter?

299
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,440
This time,

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,080
I've been humiliated many times since I was a minister.

301
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm lucky to have your help.

302
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,280
But I didn't expect that

303
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,640
I would be dragged away by your people

304
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,080
when I came to your country.

305
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,320
I was put on the bed for two hours every day

306
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,320
and was also put on the bed by your people for two hours.

307
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,920
But My Lord,

308
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,240
although I lost the war,

309
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm still the ruler of the country.

310
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,080
Look at this room.

311
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,320
It's more humble than the paper.

312
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,880
Can you see the West State?

313
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,480
There's no even a bucket in the whole room.

314
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,920
How can I live on?

315
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,160
Then why don't you die?

316
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't get me wrong, Your Majesty.

317
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,800
I mean

318
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,120
you can only live in the dead.

319
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,920
There are many wild chickens

320
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,560
who want to eat by the side of the fallen phoenix.

321
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,640
Even if I'm willing to help,

322
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,720
I can save you.

323
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,040
Why don't you

324
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,560
just be cruel?

325
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
You can't die if you keep

326
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,800
stabbing me.

327
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,960
I don't want to die.

328
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,960
Whatever.

329
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,800
The one who is tortured every day

330
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,560
is not me.

331
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:25,780
Rich people can't

332
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,400
survive either in temple or in the netherworld.

333
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,240
That's true.

334
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,880
how important it is to live.

335
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
If I didn't have the heart to die in the lake,

336
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,840
do you think

337
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
I would take the risk of being discovered by His Majesty

338
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,640
to see you secretly?

339
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
But you still came.

340
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,560
My Lord.

341
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,600
All you did all the way

342
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,240
was just to be my friend

343
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,840
and talk to you.

344
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,440
Can you say that?

345
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,480
I know.

346
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,080
As long as you can help me get out of this,

347
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,000
I will definitely fight with you.

348
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,280
In that case,

349
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,960
it's good.

350
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,680
There are only six

351
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
branches of Angu.

352
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,040
But the most important branch of Andu

353
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,560
has not been reported yet.

354
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,640
But coincidentally,

355
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,840
what we need most

356
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,800
is the branch of Andu

357
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,560
to provide us with some information

358
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,960
about the Angu court.

359
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,040
There is one person missing.

360
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,360
Wait for me to come back.

361
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,480
We are here to discuss

362
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,160
the action after entering the Angu court.

363
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
You should come with us.

364
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
What does your Liudao Hall business

365
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
have to do with me?

366
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,280
Because you are my partner.

367
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,480
I said before

368
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,360
I would not apologize to you.

369
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,640
It's because we don't need to apologize to each other.

370
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
And I am the third grandson of Yu.

371
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
I don't need to apologize to you.

372
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,200
I, Liudao Hall,

373
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
owe you my life.

374
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,560
Your life is really not worth it.

375
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,920
Follow this road.

376
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,440
We will pass by the capital tomorrow.

377
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,200
Do you want to listen?

378
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
There are people here now.

379
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
Come on, beautiful.

380
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,360
Sit here.

381
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,160
There are people here.

382
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,760
Come on.

383
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Sister Ruyi, have some tea.

384
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,560
Sister Ruyi, come on.

385
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Be careful. Be careful.

386
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,640
Wait a minute.

387
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,480
You should not clean it before you sit down.

388
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
Sister Ruyi, please.

389
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,800
Please.

390
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,520
Please sit.

391
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,240
I am like your superior,

392
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,960
you don't behave like this.

393
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:10,000
Regardless of my

394
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,680
bike.

395
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, I hope you can understand me.

396
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
But I have something to say.

397
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,640
First,

398
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
my grudge with Zhu Yi Wei

399
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,240
won't affect the Group.

400
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,520
But please don't interfere.

401
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,040
Second,

402
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,960
I was Zhu Yi Wei.

403
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,360
I'll try my best to help

404
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,600
when I'm in need.

405
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,600
But I won't take part in your action.

406
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,120
Of course.

407
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm lucky to have

408
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,960
the help of a beauty.

409
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,680
You're a good choice.

410
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,640
Great.

411
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,480
Great.

412
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,280
You're a good choice.

413
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,680
You...

414
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,280
You're a good choice.

415
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,760
You don't have to say that.

416
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,560
You're the best.

417
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,520
Yes.

418
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,920
Enough.

419
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,360
Let's talk about business first.

420
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,600
The internal conflict between

421
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,520
He Dong and Luo Xi

422
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,360
is not clear to you.

423
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm the same.

424
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,080
After all, I left An Du five years ago.

425
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,160
I've been

426
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,440
recuperating in the countryside

427
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,640
for a while.

428
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,240
Although I used the

429
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,360
Guarantee of Zhu Yi Wei

430
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,280
in Chongqing a year ago,

431
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,040
it was just a small white bird.

432
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,280
Of course, I can't

433
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,800
get any core information.

434
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
It doesn't matter.

435
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,840
If you don't have any news,

436
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
we'll go to Jinsha Tower.

437
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,560
Jinsha Tower?

438
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,880
What does it have to do

439
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,920
with the Jinsha Gang of the Four Kingdoms?

440
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
It's a family.

441
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,360
The Jinsha Gang

442
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,560
is the biggest gang in the coastal area.

443
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,840
But in recent years,

444
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,240
they've raised many swordsmen

445
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,680
and started the business of money.

446
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,480
Whether it's military affairs,

447
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,400
court secretaries,

448
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,800
or tea and tea business,

449
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,280
we can get information from them.

450
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Although the information there

451
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
may not be accurate,

452
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,720
they rely on

453
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,480
tens of thousands of

454
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,000
people from all over the country.

455
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,520
Sometimes, the information we find

456
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:17,540
is faster than our six

457
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,760
Where have you been?

458
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,800
I didn't hear about this.

459
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,120
A beautiful lady if a gehtem Att accessed it

460
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
like clear water on the sea

461
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,560
just like the bird in the sky

462
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
They even played pipa

463
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:49,120
They watched herd November

464
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Where is the Jin Sha building?

465
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
It's 70 miles from here.

466
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
We'll pass by tomorrow.

467
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
How did you know? Who took you there?

468
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
When did you go there?

469
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Tao'er.

470
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Will we pass by tomorrow?

471
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
I don't know if we'll pass by. I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

472
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
I don't know if we'll pass by.

473
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

474
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

475
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

476
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

477
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

478
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

479
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

480
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

481
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

482
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

483
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

484
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

485
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I asked Qian Zhao to go there.

486
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,680
21

487
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Then what should we do?

488
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:09,200
APP

489
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,040
My house is so couple and happy.

490
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,820
Where's the Jin Sha building?

491
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
At the west gate.

492
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,120
It's just that they came here to inquire about the news.

493
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,200
We can't do it.

494
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,960
That's right.

495
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,000
Welcome, three young masters, to the Golden Sand House.

496
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,480
Open the room upstairs.

497
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
Please come in, young master.

498
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,480
So amazing.

499
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Come on.

500
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,120
Young master,

501
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
have a drink.

502
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,480
Come on.

503
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,120
Come on.

504
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,800
Have a drink.

505
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,720
Have a drink.

506
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Come on, young master.

507
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
Let's drink.

508
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,720
Look carefully.

509
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,080
Are we really young masters?

510
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
Young master, have a drink.

511
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,280
No, no.

512
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,880
I'll take my sister out to play.

513
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,640
Come on.

514
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,560
Come and see

515
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
what we have.

516
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,800
Young master,

517
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,560
you're not only handsome,

518
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,080
but you have nothing else.

519
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,320
Young master,

520
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,160
although we didn't hide from him,

521
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,280
his eyes

522
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,840
are like a snake.

523
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,720
He's not interested in us at all.

524
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,120
Young master,

525
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,760
although you're a decent man,

526
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,840
but his eyes

527
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,680
are like a young man

528
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,440
who's full of blood.

529
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,800
Look, you're sweating.

530
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,080
Did you hear that?

531
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,040
If your relatives think your work is useless,

532
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,240
you should be able to live with their words.

533
00:27:46,460 --> 00:28:14,400
How can they be less

534
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
He dares?

535
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Okay, okay.

536
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Drink.

537
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Please enjoy.

538
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
You're the old master,

539
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
but the question this time is too complicated.

540
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,400
I'm afraid only our chief can make the decision.

541
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
A few years ago,

542
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I had a meeting with Chief Sha.

543
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,400
It's a pity that Chief Sha died three years ago.

544
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Now Chief Jin is in charge.

545
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Then I'll leave you to the introduction.

546
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
It's really unfortunate that the chief is not here today.

547
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I dare not to be self-conceited.

548
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
I can only report to him tomorrow.

549
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Please come again tomorrow.

550
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Okay.

551
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
I'll go now.

552
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I'll go now.

553
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
I'll go now.

554
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
I'll go now.

555
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
I'll go now.

556
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Thank you.

557
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
I guess it's a good idea to listen to this.

558
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Let's go.

559
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Let's go.

560
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
It's been a few years since I came here.

561
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
The size of this Golden Horde is getting bigger.

562
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,400
It seems that Chief Jin is more capable than Chief Sha.

563
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Let's not drink anymore.

564
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
What's wrong?

565
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I think I heard Yuan Lu's voice.

566
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Yuan Lu's voice?

567
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
We really can't drink anymore.

568
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
It's okay. Let's do it again.

569
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
This time, the posture.

570
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Yes.

571
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Okay.

572
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Just a little bit more. Let's do it again.

573
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't want to drink anymore.

574
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
A little bit more forward.

575
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
A little bit lower.

576
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
I can't drink anymore.

577
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
A little bit more.

578
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Go to that side.

579
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Let's go.

580
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Let's go.

581
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Let's go.

582
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Did Brother-in-law come here?

583
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't worry.

584
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
The servants are just chatting.

585
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm just here to drink.

586
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
I didn't do anything else.

587
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
You're here too?

588
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
That's good. Let's drink together.

589
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
They have nothing to do with me.

590
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
They are all the elder brother of this girl.

591
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Yes. They are all the elder brother of the servants.

592
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Come, Brother-in-law.

593
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Don't pretend anymore.

594
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Brother-in-law is usually like this too.

595
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Yes.

596
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
He is usually

597
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
the most mischievous.

598
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
He is usually the most mischievous.

599
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Please.

600
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I made a mistake.

601
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I didn't think you would do this.

602
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
You don't want to drink?

603
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
You have an old wound. I forgot.

604
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
This.

605
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
This is for you.

606
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
This is good too.

607
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
It's very sweet.

608
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I wanted to bring it back for you. Try it.

609
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I'll drink.

610
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Today, I'll risk my life to accompany the gentleman.

611
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Let's drink.

612
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Let's drink.

613
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
It's good.

614
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Let's drink.

615
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Brother Yuan Zhou.

616
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
He was only taking us out to see things.

617
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
He didn't do anything else.

618
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
And him.

619
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
You two are bad at learning, right?

620
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
What place do you come from?

621
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,640
What am I supposed to do when he already office is government and you que as a maintainer?

622
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,300
To deal with him?

623
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,800
How about it when he pays you?

624
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,460
Why don't I just miss America and isaa because of America?

625
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,380
Miss America?

626
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,180
Do you not know me?

627
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,400
Do you not want to marry him?

628
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,800
Oh, really?

629
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes.

630
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Old Qian, be careful.

631
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,200
Okay.

632
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,400
Okay.

633
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,200
What's wrong with you today?

634
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,600
You look strange.

635
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,200
Nothing.

636
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm thinking about the Pin Shao Tower.

637
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Don't you think that I didn't allow you to take them out?

638
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
That's why you're angry now?

639
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
I've already told you before.

640
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,400
And you said it before.

641
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,800
Jing City is the place of the Six-storied Pagoda

642
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,200
from the beginning to the Pin Shao Tower.

643
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,400
The key is that it's useless to be angry.

644
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
You have to be good every time.

645
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,400
But it's all because of Yang Feng.

646
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,400
I didn't want to go.

647
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,200
But when I entered the city, I accidentally saw

648
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,000
the pattern on the flag of the Pin Shao Tower.

649
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,600
What pattern?

650
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,200
I used to have a capable subordinate.

651
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Everyone in Zhu Yuwei has their own secret letter.

652
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,400
His letter is a dragon claw.

653
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,600
No wonder you asked Wuji about those questions.

654
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
It's a pity that it's not him.

655
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,600
Not only is his surname wrong, his gender is also wrong.

656
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,000
You trust that person a lot?

657
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
He's the flying doctor I brought out.

658
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,600
He helped me escape from the prison.

659
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,400
I've been up for a long time.

660
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,200
It's time to teach me.

661
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,800
Don't cry.

662
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,700
Here.

663
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,400
Come on

664
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,480
Xing

665
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Do you know that

666
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
you still drink after returning from the Golden Sand Tower?

667
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
You're not going to die?

668
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Just right. Drink with me.

669
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Okay.

670
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
It's not a small matter.

671
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
What's wrong?

672
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
It's about a beauty, right?

673
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
What's wrong?

674
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Aren't you two having a good time?

675
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Men

676
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
should be older.

677
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
After all, she's been in your room for a whole night.

678
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
She's still so drunk.

679
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
It's not appropriate, right?

680
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm the one who's in charge of this.

681
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Isn't it just a child?

682
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Close your eyes. Give it to me.

683
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
I've already given it to you.

684
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I mean,

685
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I've already agreed to give it to you.

686
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
But not now.

687
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
After everything is over,

688
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
it's not empty talk.

689
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
It's not a chance to make up for it.

690
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Then she's not happy.

691
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
She's happy.

692
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
But I'm not happy.

693
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Since I promised her,

694
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
she thinks everything is settled.

695
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
It's the same as before.

696
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I can't say it's the same.

697
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,480
But it's probably a little more concerned than before.

698
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
But that concern is like

699
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
being trapped outside.

700
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
A few pieces of bean curd in a silk cloth.

701
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Do you understand that feeling?

702
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
No.

703
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
You're drinking alone here.

704
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Just because her attitude is not so simple?

705
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Not really.

706
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Tonight, just now,

707
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
something must have happened.

708
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Yes.

709
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
She also went to the murder house.

710
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
And she called a few beautiful girls into the room.

711
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Don't be surprised.

712
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
She did call the beautiful girls in.

713
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
But nothing could have happened.

714
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Even I was angry,

715
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
she didn't even notice.

716
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
She was very bold.

717
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
She was with those young men.

718
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
She was very young,

719
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
and she was very happy.

720
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Do you know that?

721
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
But she was so honest.

722
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
She was so carefree.

723
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I felt that...

724
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Not really.

725
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Didn't you think it through?

726
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
A beauty is not this kind of

727
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
who looks like a monster,

728
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
but in some places,

729
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
there's no opening.

730
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Of course I can understand.

731
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I told myself countless times

732
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
that she didn't mean it.

733
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
She doesn't understand.

734
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I only had a child with her.

735
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
She didn't have anything else to do with me.

736
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
But...

737
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
But I just...

738
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
You just want to drink.

739
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Come on.

740
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Ning,

741
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
you're so surprised.

742
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
I've known you for so many years.

743
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
I thought you were a

744
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
cool and unmoving girl.

745
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Now you're not.

746
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
You're drunk.

747
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
I want to talk to you in person.

748
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Why are you laughing at me?

749
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Get out.

750
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
I'm in a hurry.

751
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Do you want me to help you?

752
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
What?

753
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
What?

754
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
I knew it was wrong to have a beauty,

755
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
but I can't tell you why.

756
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
Now I know she was a doctor,

757
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,480
so I'm more open.

758
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
The girls in the hospital

759
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
are pretty.

760
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
They have a bad life.

761
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Especially the squirrels.

762
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
They're toys.

763
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
They're controlled by the medicine.

764
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Even if one day,

765
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
the sky is clear,

766
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
it's not a detective or a killer.

767
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,480
It's not easy to live to be 30 years old.

768
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I've seen the strange things,

769
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
and I've seen the life of Zhao Bu Bao Xi.

770
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
When I see those beautiful girls,

771
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
it's like...

772
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
It's like...

773
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,480
It's like seeing those flowers and grass.

774
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,480
It's like when you see that rose.

775
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
You don't have to care about it.

776
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
I know these things.

777
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Listen to me.

778
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Mei Er doesn't care about you now.

779
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
She doesn't know

780
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
where you are in her heart.

781
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,480
You have to make her understand.

782
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
You have to let her know

783
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
you're not that kind of a person.

784
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
You have to make her jealous.

785
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
You have to make her jealous.

786
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,480
You have to make her feel guilty about you.

787
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Feel guilty?

788
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
How did the only women in our troupe

789
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
who are the king and her,

790
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
get involved?

791
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Let me give you an example.

792
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
She asked you to help,

793
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
and you said you were busy.

794
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,480
If she gave you something,

795
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,480
you pretended to have no idea

796
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
what the lady who used to be your girlfriend

797
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
gave you.

798
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
If she dares to get close to another man,

799
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
you'd turn into a person.

800
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Tell her you're not happy.

801
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
You're not the father of this child.

802
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
You're so stubborn

803
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
and pretending to be generous.

804
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
It's nothing, right?

805
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,480
What you said is reliable.

806
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
She has seen so many men.

807
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
How can she not see this kind of a woman?

808
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
Ning,

809
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,480
she has seen many men.

810
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
But once a woman gets to know me,

811
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
she'll be different.

812
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Don't be so dramatic.

813
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Think about it.

814
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,480
Is there any man in this world

815
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,480
who knows women better than me?

816
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,480
No.

817
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Trust me.

818
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Tomorrow.

819
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
Try it.

820
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
This is the last city

821
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,480
in the Great Wujing of the Great Wall.

822
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
Before we enter the city,

823
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
should we buy some more things

824
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
to use in the future?

825
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Okay.

826
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I'll do it right now.

827
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
Mr. Du.

828
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
It's okay. My waist is cramping.

829
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Mr. Du.

830
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Are you going to the police station tonight?

831
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
When are we leaving the city?

832
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Tomorrow.

833
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,480
I want to go out

834
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,480
and ask about the attention of the police.

835
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
You can do it.

836
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Okay.

837
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Do as you like.

838
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,480
These are the secret bags sent by the Silk Store.

839
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Can you help me

840
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,480
communicate the inner heart later?

841
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
You can find Shi San.

842
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,480
He knows more about women than I do.

843
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Yuan Luo.

844
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
Bring me the jade picture.

845
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,480
Okay.

846
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Sister Ruyi.

847
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,480
There is a letter

848
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
from a maid to her.

849
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
It's a love letter.

850
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
It's definitely a love letter.

851
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,480
What?

852
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,480
I read it by accident.

853
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
The guards in the city

854
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
are very reliable.

855
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,480
This...

856
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,480
An Du is here.

857
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,480
Let's follow this path.

858
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Let's go.

859
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,480
Let's go.

860
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Let's go.

861
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,480
Let's go.

862
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
Let's go.

863
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
Let's go.

864
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,480
Let's go.

865
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Let's go.

866
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,480
Let's go.

867
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,480
Let's go.

868
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Let's go.

869
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Let's go.

870
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Good morning, Miss Ruyi.

871
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,480
It's already three o'clock in the morning.

872
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
You're still early.

873
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
I'm here.

874
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,480
Mission accomplished.

875
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,480
Brother Lang.

876
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Qiu Jianmei.

877
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
He's in a hurry.

878
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,480
He's in a hurry.

879
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,480
I'm here.

880
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
I'm here.

881
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480

882
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480

I'm here.

884
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,480
I'm here.

00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
I'm here.

887
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,480

888
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,480

00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
I'm here.

893
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
I'm here.

894
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
I'm here.

895
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480

00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
I'm here.

897
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
I'm here.

898
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,480
I'm here.

899
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
I'm here.

900
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
I'm here.

901
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480

942
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,480
