1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,160
I can't forget the past when I'm with you.

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
I still remember the past.

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
I still remember the past.

4
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,920
When the time comes, I'll be back.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,200
How are you?

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,920
The Long Ballad

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,040
Xiao Ke has been a good daughter.

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,600
She's a good daughter.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
She's a bright and talented girl.

10
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,000
But she's a gentle girl.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,040
She's the best daughter

12
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,360
of your father.

The Mountain of Thoughts

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Episode 16

17
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,520
Sister Ruyi, is this right?

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,920
Again

19
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,040
Okay

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
There is a fairy in the grass, the star is in the sky

21
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,640
Shut up

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,400
Okay, I'll shut up

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,440
Niantao

24
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,640
A secret letter from the headquarters

25
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
You go ahead and find a deserted inn

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
We don't go out this time

27
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,240
understand

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Ding Hui

29
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
Brother Qian, the last half

30
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
I'm not hungry, you eat

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,080
Let go

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,480
Brother 13, here you are

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,280
I can't eat

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,240
Just now, old Ning and the beauty

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,560
What did you say to the inn?

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,760
Why does she look different?

37
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
If you tell me

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll give you a sip of my peach blossom sauce

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,000
Then give me the peach blossom sauce first

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,320
Brother 13 lied to you

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,240
You tell me first

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,400
Sister Ruyi wants to have a baby with him

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,520
But don't be affectionate

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,720
She wants today

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,480
She treats others as a treasure

46
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,560
Others treat her as a fork

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
You clearly don't know how to treat others

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,040
Is it a pity what I said?

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
Besides, is your Brother Qian a stranger?

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,320
This time we don't live in the inn

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
Maybe we have to find a hotel in front

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,480
Then what is the fork?

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,040
It's

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,560
Yuan Luo

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,040
Don't come over

56
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,360
There is such a good thing

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,080
Your Highness

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
Chu Shanyi is still resting

59
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Please go to the inn for now

60
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,560
Sir Du

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,920
Chu Shanyi is still resting

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,560
We will stay here for now

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
Miss Ruyi, let me help you

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,880
Let me help you

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,040
Brothers behind

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Work faster

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,680
This way, please

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
A letter from the nearby branch

69
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,520
It's the same as the flying pigeon transmission I received this afternoon

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,120
The trusted person of the Dan Yang King

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
General Zhou Jian of Pingyuan

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,920
Has led three thousand Qin soldiers

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,400
Ready to stop us

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,200
So I asked Sun Lang

75
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,680
To find a deserted inn in advance

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,440
In case that he would be afraid of us

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
He ambushed us in the inn

78
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,680
But we are soldiers sent by the court

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,760
The Dan Yang King actually sent soldiers to stop us

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,720
Of course they won't do it directly

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,040
They can pretend to receive

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
Or escort

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,480
Pretend to be the fire of the inn or something

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Or pull it into the valley

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Just kill it

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
No fire

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,200
Then bury it on the bandits Liu Kou

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,800
Or Zhu Yiwei

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,240
That's about it

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,200
If you don't want me to do it

91
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,040
From now on, line up

92
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,640
We got something

93
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,120
General Zhou Ge

94
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,480
Lines of those people

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
Don't you hear it

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,040
This person is so clever

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,680
He is our second son

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,360
Send someone to kill him

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,920
Give it to me

100
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,320
Go

101
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
intelligently

102
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,920
Yes

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
tell the first son

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,440
I want him unfortunately

105
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
It's not cold.

106
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
What's wrong?

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,040
Put on your clothes.

108
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
Mr. Qian, don't.

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,440
That's right.

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
We don't fight with Ning.

111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
If Ning doesn't want to,

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,720
we will.

113
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
That's right.

114
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,440
People who can enter the six halls

115
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,240
are all strong.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Yeah.

117
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,080
Don't think that he doesn't look up to you.

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,680
That's not true.

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,640
That's right.

120
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,720
I've heard about

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,040
the person who followed Zhao Ji.

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,520
Ding Hui.

123
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,120
Tell them

124
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,880
how Luo Qingqiang died.

125
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,440
Well,

126
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,000
Luo Qingqiang only took one move

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
from Miss Ren.

128
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,920
Then...

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
Really?

130
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,920
Do you understand?

131
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,120
You want to play a trick in front of him.

132
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,240
You should think about your own life first.

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,640
See?

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,600
He...

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,640
He smiled.

136
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,240
Really?

137
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,360
Yeah.

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,840
It's settled.

139
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,000
Try to understand.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
You've been single for a long time.

141
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
It's rare to meet a girl who is a pervert.

142
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,200
Besides, your cousin

143
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,920
is a real pervert.

144
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,600
She's not my cousin.

145
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,440
Then why don't you have a baby with her?

146
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,880
I...

147
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,680
You...

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,680
I...

149
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,480
What's up?

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,880
Those guards

151
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,200
are a little confused.

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,840
I hope you don't mind.

153
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,400
Why are they confused?

154
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,680
Anyway...

155
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,200
I...

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,880
I...

157
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,480
I...

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,240
I...

159
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,040
I...

160
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,720
I...

161
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,480
I...

162
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,080
I...

163
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
I...

164
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,600
I...

165
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,240
I...

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,040
I...

167
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,840
I...

168
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,640
I...

169
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,480
I...

170
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,240
I...

171
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
I...

172
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,840
I...

173
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,440
I...

174
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,240
I...

175
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Why would you...

176
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,480
Why would you curse at me?

177
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,400
What?

178
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
Nothing.

179
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,400
Seriously...

180
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
Do you want to see your cousin?

181
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
Xiao effectivement at that matter.

182
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,160
And threatening me with the sÃ¶yleded telethon.

183
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,280
Aren't you the first person meeting him?

184
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,040
Yes.

185
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,960
Why?

186
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,280
Because...

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,440
You've been with him

188
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,360
all these years wouldn't have an option.

189
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Sure, I'm sorry.

190
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,920
Don't worry.

191
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,040
After all,

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,560
there are not many people

193
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,640
who are willing to sell their lives with me in Anguo.

194
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,240
Anything else?

195
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,760
Can you stay with His Highness

196
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
for a few days?

197
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,120
There are assassins.

198
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,160
Who is Lord Dan Yang?

199
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,560
I need Xuan Ling and Zhen Zhu Niu.

200
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,520
I've prepared them.

201
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,440
Does Lord Dan Yang know about it?

202
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,160
He doesn't know.

203
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
Only Zhang Song and Her Majesty know

204
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
about the return of the camp.

205
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
You know what I want to ask?

206
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,200
They are colleagues after all.

207
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,040
I don't have money from your six halls.

208
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,840
I can buy a few thousand gold

209
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,480
at random.

210
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,520
It's just a lot of money.

211
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,640
We usually save money and live a life.

212
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,400
Sometimes we don't even have money to buy horses.

213
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,640
The people on the top

214
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,560
hope that we can

215
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,040
do everything we can.

216
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,080
On the one hand, they hope that we can

217
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,000
travel the world like gods.

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,520
You are like that too.

219
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
When I was here,

220
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,400
it was more troublesome

221
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,400
to spend time

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
than killing people

223
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,680
than to pay for the money.

224
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,080
Shisan and others will be back later.

225
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Do you want to discuss

226
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
the plan with us?

227
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,000
Me?

228
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
Don't worry.

229
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,560
Of course.

230
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,920
I told you long ago

231
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
that you are my partner.

232
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,520
But I'm not being kind.

233
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,160
It's just that this time,

234
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,440
there are too many men of Lord Dan Yang.

235
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,480
We can only work together.

236
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Call me when you are ready.

237
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,880
If you want to laugh, then laugh.

238
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,600
Don't hold back.

239
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,520
You can laugh at me.

240
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
But you must not

241
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,280
be disrespectful to Miss Ruyi.

242
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,320
Understand?

243
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,640
Yes.

244
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
I pretended to be a musician

245
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,680
and got into Zhou Jian's

246
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
and his assistant were talking about this.

247
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,080
He said that

248
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,680
this time,

249
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,400
he won't let us leave

250
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
the mountain pass alive.

251
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,520
This is it.

252
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,240
This is the only way to the delegation.

253
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,440
Then we won't go to that pass.

254
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
We will go to the small road on the mountain.

255
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,200
No.

256
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,040
Even if we can go there,

257
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,080
His Highness's car can't go there.

258
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm not going to the mountain pass.

259
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm going to the mountain pass.

260
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
I'm going to the mountain pass.

261
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,480
And we still have the gold.

262
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,440
Even if we pull up with a small car,

263
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,520
it's too noisy.

264
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,160
It will still attract their attention.

265
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,000
What if we go to the mountain pass?

266
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,280
They have arranged a thousand people in the mountain pass.

267
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,600
There are also various masters.

268
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
We are the only ones who can get rid of them.

269
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,360
We can only rely on the pass.

270
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,520
What do you think?

271
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,720
Kill.

272
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
The Qin thief first kills the Qin king.

273
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,240
As long as we kill Zhou Jian,

274
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,200
the situation will suddenly change.

275
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,680
Then the thousand people in the pass will not be afraid.

276
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,480
How to kill?

277
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,120
I'll do it.

278
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,600
You want him to die.

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,920
Cool.

280
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,960
How many percent of your internal force is now recovered?

281
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,240
Half.

282
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,320
That's not right.

283
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,200
Zhou Jian is from Wutan.

284
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,680
Even if you succeed,

285
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't think you can leave.

286
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,880
He has been famous for a long time.

287
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,880
I have seen his scrolls before.

288
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,880
I calculated it.

289
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,960
At most, if you destroy one arm,

290
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,360
you can definitely kill him.

291
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,160
Even if Zhou Jian dies,

292
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,240
the mountain pass still has his army.

293
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,920
We will have to fight back.

294
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,880
The people in the delegation are not weak.

295
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,160
This is too much damage.

296
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,840
This doesn't work, that doesn't work.

297
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,040
Then what do you want me to do?

298
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,560
In our line of work,

299
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
isn't it necessary to make a bet on life every day?

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's not that you can't bet.

301
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,360
You just can't just gamble.

302
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,840
You have to calculate the winning rate to the maximum.

303
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,480
How about this?

304
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,320
Tell me about it.

305
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
You have read the content of Zhou Jian's scrolls.

306
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
I can compare it with the six-channel one.

307
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,880
I only remember that he is over forty years old.

308
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,680
His surname is Hao Shuang. He likes to drink.

309
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,480
He usually doesn't read.

310
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,920
He doesn't know much about literature.

311
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,480
But he likes to read some

312
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,280
famous writers.

313
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,120
He claims to be the second-in-chief of the previous dynasty,

314
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Zhou Du Du.

315
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,720
Shisi.

316
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,680
Shisi.

317
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,000
Are you sure

318
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,880
he doesn't know that the Six-channel Hall

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,160
is also escorting the princess?

320
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,200
I think he doesn't know.

321
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,240
Why?

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
We haven't been to the courier station.

323
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,840
Yichen, the courier officer, and I

324
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,800
also said hello.

325
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,520
They

326
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,520
thought we didn't go to the mountain pass.

327
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
His staff also said

328
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,320
they thought we only had

329
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,640
twenty guards in total.

330
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,280
The 100,000 taels of gold that killed us

331
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,680
were half given to the King of Danyang

332
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,520
and half of them were left as military gifts.

333
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,880
If that's the case,

334
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,640
we'd better be wise.

335
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,960
Now that Zhou Jian is here, we are here.

336
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,480
As long as...

337
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
Let's talk it over.

338
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,960
Yang Ying should go to bed.

339
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,360
I should go, too.

340
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,240
Boss.

341
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Is Sister Ru Yi angry?

342
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,560
She's not angry.

343
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,920
She's just not used to

344
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
discussing things with so many people.

345
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,960
She's used to reading

346
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,280
the book of assassins.

347
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,880
You seem to know her well.

348
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,760
Let's talk about business.

349
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,440
All right.

350
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,680
I support Zhiqun.

351
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,120
We can...

352
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,080
The pearl bird is more sensitive to

353
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,880
poison than people.

354
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,400
If someone releases the poison,

355
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,360
it will call out.

356
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
That's interesting.

357
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
The scroll is hung on the window.

358
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,640
The assassin will smile when he meets it.

359
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,680
I understand.

360
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,600
How dare you!

361
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm not the princess.

362
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,680
I'm Prince Li.

363
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,160
I'm sorry.

364
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Please forgive me.

365
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,080
Lady Ren.

366
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,080
I'm so lonely.

367
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,240
I order you to join me.

368
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
I'll tell you

369
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,620
how to coerce His Highness.

370
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,960
Just like the prisoners of various states,

371
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,160
in order to

372
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,460
get back what we got to each other's

373
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,180
If you don't want to show yourself,

374
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,940
you have to learn to calm down.

375
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,220
Okay.

376
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,580
How can I calm down?

377
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
First, frown.

378
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,780
Second, don't move.

379
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Third,

380
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
say it in two words.

381
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,020
Get out.

382
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,420
Get out.

383
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,980
Forgive me, Your Highness.

384
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,820
But I really have nowhere to go.

385
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,340
Please contact me.

386
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Get out.

387
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,420
You're rude.

388
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,940
Guards, take this scoundrel out.

389
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,060
Did I do it right?

390
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,220
Not bad.

391
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
You did it a little bit.

392
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Really?

393
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,540
But,

394
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,740
Ru Yi,

395
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,620
how can you know so many things?

396
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,620
If only I could be half as beautiful as you.

397
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,820
I learned it too.

398
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,540
If I don't learn well, I'll die.

399
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,620
You're the same.

400
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm not afraid.

401
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,380
I've seen it these days.

402
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,900
You're as good as Brother Yuanzhou.

403
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,980
You're good at talking.

404
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,980
But you actually want to scare me.

405
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,700
Yang Ying,

406
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
remember this.

407
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
True love and true intention

408
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,420
have long been dead on me and Ning Yuanzhou.

409
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,940
Maybe when he was a guard in the palace,

410
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,740
he still had feelings for you.

411
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,380
But if one day you still can't wake up,

412
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,820
he'll really kill you.

413
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,820
Just like how I can

414
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,020
lie to you

415
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,700
and kill you at the same time.

416
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Don't believe anyone.

417
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,220
No matter how good he is to you,

418
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
he'll never betray you.

419
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,740
Only yourself.

420
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,020
This is the most important thing

421
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,220
I taught you.

422
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Remember it.

423
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Go to sleep.

424
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Your Highness.

425
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,740
Your Highness, good morning.

426
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,340
You didn't sleep well last night?

427
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,740
I didn't sleep well last night.

428
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,540
I had a little sleep last night.

429
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,140
Why hasn't everyone packed up yet?

430
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,540
When are we leaving?

431
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,740
We're not leaving today.

432
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,140
Head said that Yuan Di is on his way.

433
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Where did he go?

434
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
He and Brother 13

435
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
persuaded Zhou Jian to let us go.

436
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,340
Isn't Zhou Jian a man of the Dan Yang brothers?

437
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,940
Will he listen to Brother Yuanzhou

438
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,340
and Mr. Ning's words?

439
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,940
I've already made up my mind.

440
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,540
This time, I can't let him listen.

441
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,340
He wants to kidnap Zhou Jian?

442
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,340
Is this the method you discussed yesterday?

443
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,740
It's more useful than kidnapping.

444
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,340
Sister Ruyi, just wait and see.

445
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,340
Why is King Li's footsteps so slow?

446
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,140
When will they enter Mount Tushan?

447
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm Ning Yuanzhou, the leader of the Six Halls.

448
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
I'm here to see General Zhou

449
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,740
under the order of Prince Dan Yang.

450
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,340
Ning Yuanzhou?

451
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,340
Some secret rooms

452
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
are not suitable for the ears of the third person.

453
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,940
So I can only ask Zhang Canjun

454
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,340
to take a break.

455
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,940
Two years ago,

456
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,740
General Zhou and I had a meeting

457
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,140
at the Palace of God.

458
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,740
I don't know if you still remember.

459
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
I remember.

460
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,140
But you've already been...

461
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,940
I have to thank you for your kindness

462
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,740
and let me get my life back.

463
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,540
Only then can I have the opportunity

464
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,140
to work for you

465
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,540
with General Zhou.

466
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,940
This order is a proof.

467
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,340
Wait.

468
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,340
I need to check the printed documents.

469
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,740
The Emperor sent you here.

470
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,540
When was that?

471
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,740
The 27th.

472
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,140
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

473
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,940
Don't blame me for being suspicious.

474
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
It's just that a few days ago,

475
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,540
I just received a flyer from the Prince's Mansion

476
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,140
and ordered me to stop Prince Li.

477
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,340
I don't know why now...

478
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
It's just that a few days ago,

479
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,540
I haven't returned to the capital yet.

480
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,340
I haven't seen His Highness.

481
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,740
Otherwise,

482
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,140
how could I let those people

483
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,940
have such a

484
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,740
bad idea?

485
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,140
They even want to do it directly.

486
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,540
They don't even think

487
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
that Prince Li

488
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,940
will come to the country if he really dies.

489
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,140
How could Zhangsun and the Empress

490
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,340
be so afraid of the Emperor?

491
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,740
They only need to catch a few people

492
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
when you attack them.

493
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,940
Then, His Highness

494
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,140
will be able to escape the crime of killing the Emperor and betraying the country.

495
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,340
And General Zhou, you...

496
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,740
You will also be able to escape the death penalty of a spirit.

497
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,340
But fortunately, General Zhou, you are a gentleman.

498
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,140
You only served in the Tushan Pass.

499
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,740
This is why you didn't make a big mistake.

500
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
That's right.

501
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,740
I already felt that something was wrong.

502
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,140
Lord Ning, what's your good plan?

503
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,540
I've presented a plan to His Highness.

504
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,340
I don't know if you've heard

505
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,940
that there was a time when General Zhang

506
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
used the straw man to disguise himself

507
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
to lure the enemy into the camp.

508
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,940
Of course I know.

509
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,340
General Zhou is indeed talented.

510
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,740
My plan is called

511
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,340
to steal food and exchange for help.

512
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,940
King of Li has been in the palace for years.

513
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,740
Of course, I don't know what he looks like.

514
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,140
We just need to form a fake delegation.

515
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,940
We dare to enter the case before the real delegation

516
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,740
and then have some conflicts with the secret agents.

517
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,140
We will die in the dark country.

518
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,340
If this happens,

519
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,540
the peace talks between the two countries will be broken.

520
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,740
When the war is at its peak,

521
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
who will still care where King of Li is?

522
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,940
As long as His Majesty can't return to the country,

523
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,340
then the throne will naturally be in the hands of our Highness.

524
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,740
But,

525
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,540
if the real delegation fails,

526
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,740
nobody will think about us or His Highness.

527
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,340
This plan really is wonderful.

528
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,940
It's just that the delegation is not small.

529
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
It's hard to find the right person

530
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,540
among the Cang Family.

531
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,340
General Zhou, you don't have to worry about this.

532
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,340
I've arranged to let Liu Daotang help us.

533
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,740
It's not a perfect match.

534
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,140
But at least we can send a few people

535
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,940
to investigate the truth.

536
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
But at least 70% or 80%

537
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Really?

538
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
Really

539
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:42,640
Tr centers'

540
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,580
What does Ning Wanzhou want to do?

541
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,180
Why did Zhou Jian believe him?

542
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,420
That's a pretty good plan.

543
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,740
Although this plan was thought by Lao Ning,

544
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,140
I've done a lot of things.

545
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,500
Let's get to the point.

546
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,220
To make Zhou Jian believe me,

547
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,940
we need the King of Danyang's seal and secret order.

548
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,460
Yesterday, I went to his place to steal

549
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,700
the letter he had made with King of Danyang.

550
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,700
Try again.

551
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,500
Yuan Lu can make the move

552
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,820
and make a copy of the seal

553
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,300
with the mechanism he knows.

554
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,540
Isn't that right, Erke?

555
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,060
As for the secret order,

556
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,780
it's Lao Ning's ability.

557
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,940
He smelled the milk in the letter.

558
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,180
He was sure that the secret order was written with a milk-soaked brush.

559
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,700
He asked Sun Lang to catch a previous messenger.

560
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,340
I'll give you one last chance.

561
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,500
Say it or not?

562
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,900
I'll say it.

563
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,500
After the old man questioned him,

564
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,700
he was late for half an hour.

565
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,900
Finally, he got those secret orders

566
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,940
from the God of Danyang.

567
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,180
The previous move also solved the secret order.

568
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,180
Although he is a dead man,

569
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,340
he is open-minded and

570
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,500
knows how to play chess and call for help.

571
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,220
He knows how to trick people.

572
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,580
You came up with all these

573
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,220
fake ideas?

574
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,900
The real mission team has become the fake mission team.

575
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,180
Zhou Jian has to

576
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
pass the test with great effort.

577
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,260
How is it?

578
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,540
Is Lao Ning good?

579
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,100
Not really.

580
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,140
We've killed Zhou Jian.

581
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,620
Why do we have to do all these?

582
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,620
I'm not sure.

583
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,580
Didn't we...

584
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,980
Didn't we calculate it before?

585
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,220
If we break in,

586
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,420
we'll hurt people.

587
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,460
I don't want to

588
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,740
let anyone of us get hurt.

589
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,860
So I'd rather kill them

590
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
than break in.

591
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,980
You treat your subordinates as brothers.

592
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,780
You can just say that.

593
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,100
Do you really believe it?

594
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,500
You don't believe it if others don't.

595
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,780
Those who work in our industry

596
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,420
are all working hard.

597
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,300
We are not fools.

598
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,260
Who can really be born with us

599
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,900
is clear in heart.

600
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,660
Lao Ning has good martial arts and high IQ.

601
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,020
But in these two years,

602
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,140
he can't be the leader.

603
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,780
The fire demon cave in the evil track

604
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,260
was blown up by him.

605
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,380
Four ribs were broken.

606
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,780
So the five-year-old Yuan Lu

607
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,540
and a group of stoned mechanical masters

608
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,060
were dug out of the ashes.

609
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,100
The late emperor was poisoned by the Su people.

610
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,260
The late leader was killed for the crime.

611
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,660
He was ordered to kill himself.

612
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,740
He made an order.

613
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,380
He found the real murderer in ten days.

614
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,900
He saved the lives of all the five hundred people.

615
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,020
The rules of our six Taoist churches

616
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,740
are much more than yours.

617
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,220
Only the top three Taoists were born.

618
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,660
How can you be the leader?

619
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,340
Lao Ning is a tea in hell.

620
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,260
Why did he break this rule?

621
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,500
It was our six Taoist brothers

622
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,700
who brought him up.

623
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,420
Do you think he is a real brother?

624
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,620
You are willing to go to the country to save Wu Di

625
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
because of this?

626
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
Of course.

627
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,820
Of course it's because of you, beauty.

628
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,540
Do you know?

629
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
He is particularly worried about your injury.

630
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,300
He heard that you were going to assassinate Zhou Jian that day.

631
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,900
He was about to jump out of his heart.

632
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,980
Beauty, you have to believe me.

633
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,700
Really?

634
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
I was clearly real.

635
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,740
I have to pretend to be fake.

636
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,660
Yes.

637
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,460
It's the least loss and the safest to pass the pass.

638
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,660
But...

639
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,980
Don't be afraid.

640
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,060
You are a fake beauty.

641
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,180
It's normal to show some flaws in haste.

642
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,180
As long as you don't talk,

643
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,580
it will depend on Ning Yuan Zhou's color.

644
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,100
He stayed at Junya

645
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,580
to stabilize Zhou Jian.

646
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,100
He has to talk to Zhou Jian constantly

647
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,020
so that he can find the wrong place without time.

648
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,380
Okay.

649
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,580
What about Mr. Du?

650
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,900
He is the leader of the delegation.

651
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,660
What if he falls for it?

652
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,380
This is the leader of the delegation.

653
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,100
How dare you!

654
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,780
I am the third-ranked leader.

655
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,940
You are just a general.

656
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,540
How dare you be rude to me?

657
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,900
General Zhou.

658
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,300
This is real.

659
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,580
I was at home.

660
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,940
I pretended to pass the empress's decree

661
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,220
and asked her to be the leader.

662
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,460
She thought she was really the leader.

663
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,780
I am sorry.

664
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,780
I was wrong.

665
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,020
Only half-truth and half-fake can fool Anrui.

666
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,460
Enough.

667
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,260
Please forgive me.

668
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,260
I was busy with military affairs.

669
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,580
I was rude.

670
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,060
Mr. Du.

671
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,500
General Zhou helped us arrange the whole city.

672
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,020
Please forgive me.

673
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,860
You are really a good man.

674
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,260
You are really a good man.

675
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,740
In a few days,

676
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,500
you can organize such a good city.

677
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,820
Even I almost got fooled.

678
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,020
Time is too hasty.

679
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,700
We still can't find the right person.

680
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,540
Look at these guards.

681
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,940
They are so stupid.

682
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,140
They are so stupid.

683
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,860
They are so stupid.

684
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,780
They are so stupid.

685
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,660
Especially this Prince Li.

686
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,820
He is really a little bit unruly.

687
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
It's a little bit late.

688
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,580
We can only work hard.

689
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,220
We will have a good time on the way.

690
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,020
Don't worry.

691
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,060
I wonder how General Zhou arranged for us

692
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,260
at the gate.

693
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,180
I will send you to pass the border.

694
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,500
I promise that no one can see your real face

695
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,340
except me.

696
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,860
Okay.

697
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,180
Thank you, General Zhou.

698
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,740
Let's set off.

699
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,660
Let's go.

700
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,860
General Zhou is really thoughtful.

701
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,100
Thank you.

702
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,220
You are flattering me.

703
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,060
Those who read the stories of the world

704
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,580
are all wise and talented.

705
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,500
You are welcome.

706
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,140
I just received a letter from the flying pigeon.

707
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,780
The real delegation

708
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,300
is just three miles away.

709
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,020
I will leave it to you

710
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,380
to stop them.

711
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,380
But don't forget your order.

712
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,980
Just delay the process.

713
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,420
Don't make a scene.

714
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,220
And

715
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,460
the delegation

716
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,260
is really fake

717
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,300
to prevent the bandits from being transported.

718
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,380
The amount of money

719
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
on the horse is real.

720
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,220
Please make yourself at home.

721
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,180
You are really a good man.

722
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,620
I will leave now.

723
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,300
Goodbye.

724
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,540
Go.

725
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,020
Go to the border quickly.

726
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,660
Deliver the delegation as soon as possible.

727
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,220
We just passed the border like this?

728
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,780
Not to mention the assassins.

729
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,180
There is no one to question us.

730
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,340
It's fun, right?

731
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,300
This is why

732
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
everyone likes to work with Ning.

733
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,580
Your Highness.

734
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,100
Your Highness.

735
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,540
The secret letter.

736
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,660
Ridiculous.

737
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,740
I have to leave the palace immediately.

738
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,660
As long as you deliver the message,

739
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,940
just tell me I have an emergency.

740
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,900
I won't go to the meeting.

741
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,740
Yes.

742
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,180
Your Highness.

743
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,020
Her Majesty wants to see you.

744
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,940
Your Highness.

745
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,900
Her Majesty wants to see you.

746
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,740
Your Highness.

747
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,500
Her Majesty wants to see you.

748
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,100
Why did you kill the delegation?

749
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,500
If I say it's not me,

750
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,100
will you believe me?

751
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,540
Zhou Jian is your cousin's daughter.

752
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,060
If it's not you,

753
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,700
who else can it be?

754
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,820
We studied together in the imperial study

755
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,980
for six years.

756
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,420
You know very well who I am.

757
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,500
Ying is also my sister.

758
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,660
How could I do

759
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,020
something that would kill my blood relatives?

760
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,500
You didn't know how to do it before.

761
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,780
But now,

762
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,940
for that dragon's tail,

763
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,780
I'm afraid you can't wait for your brother

764
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,140
to die in the country of An.

765
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,460
What can a lady like Ying do?

766
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,500
Answer me.

767
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,340
Did you order it?

768
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,100
It's not me.

769
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,020
It's my uncle,

770
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,260
Marquis Yongping.

771
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,300
Even if I wanted to kill him,

772
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,260
I wouldn't have chosen to do it.

773
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,340
The delegation hasn't left the country yet.

774
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,860
In the end,

775
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,140
you still want to kill Ying

776
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,740
or make His Majesty not be able to go back to the country?

777
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,700
I was going to go to Marquis Yongping's mansion

778
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,940
to stop my uncle.

779
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,100
I always have something to ask you.

780
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
When my father granted you and him a marriage,

781
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,860
you didn't want to do it.

782
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,020
You even wanted to run away from it.

783
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,020
After you entered the palace, he had another favor.

784
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,260
You were close to him.

785
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,100
But now, why do you

786
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,140
always act like

787
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,620
a deep-loved empress?

788
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,700
Did you suddenly fall in love with him?

789
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,820
Now, the royal family has never had a second love.

790
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,340
It doesn't matter whether I like His Majesty or not.

791
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,580
What matters is

792
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,300
only him

793
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,340
can make me the most noble woman in the whole of the Wu State.

794
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,500
But if we work together,

795
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,340
you can continue to be the empress.

796
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,380
Yan,

797
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,540
actually, I...

798
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,340
Actually, I'm still...

799
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,900
You know that.

800
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,540
I...

801
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,900
I've never been to the city.

802
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,740
But

803
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,180
I want to be the empress dowager.

804
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,620
To be the empress.

805
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,740
All the honor

806
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,580
can only come from your favor.

807
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,140
But to be the empress dowager,

808
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,860
before she takes over the throne,

809
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,900
I'll only have the power in my own hands.

810
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,420
Okay.

811
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,980
Yan,

812
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,340
there's an ancient land ahead.

813
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,460
The road is slippery.

814
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,860
If I go any further,

815
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,820
I'll lose my horse.

816
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,100
It seems that no matter what,

817
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,300
we can't get to Shu Zhou today.

818
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,180
Tell them to find a high place

819
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,100
and camp there.

820
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,860
Yes.

821
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,820
I'll go with you.

822
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,740
What's up?

823
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,220
Today is the tenth day.

824
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,260
Yes.

825
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,780
The poison hasn't started yet.

826
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,980
When we get to Shu Zhou tomorrow,

827
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,020
we can get the antidote.

828
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,580
You'd better not lie to me.

829
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,460
You'd better give up on this idea.

830
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,300
We have an iron law in the Six Halls.

831
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,380
If we're partners in the mission,

832
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,940
we can't have any intimate relationship.

833
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,500
I have to obey.

834
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,260
I'm a member of the Imperial Guards.

835
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,140
I don't have to follow the rules of the Six Halls.

836
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,260
But you're our partner now.

837
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,620
Am I that bad?

838
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,100
So bad

839
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,700
that I can't move you at all?

840
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,300
No.

841
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,620
You're great.

842
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,020
You can even say

843
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,060
that you're the biggest temptation I've ever met.

844
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,820
Then why did you refuse?

845
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,900
I won't harm you.

846
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,500
My rationality tells me

847
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,060
that we're actually the same kind of people.

848
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,980
I think you should understand.

849
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,620
For people like us who travel the world,

850
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,540
every sudden luck

851
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,980
is a danger.

852
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,500
Can you fall in love with me?

853
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,340
I can.

854
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,180
It's my honor

855
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,140
to fall in love with you.

856
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,260
But there are many good men in the world.

857
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,980
The safest way to get along with each other

858
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,780
is to fulfill our promise

859
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,860
and go to heaven together.

860
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,860
You'd better keep your promise

861
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,660
and help me find out the real murderer who murdered Her Highness.

862
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:06,900
Or...

863
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,260
Or you'll kill me.

864
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,180
You've said it too many times.

865
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,500
I'm getting goose bumps.

866
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,060
Who told you to lie to me about the child?

867
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,580
I...

868
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,300
The child is different.

869
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,300
And...

870
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,180
And who would have thought that you're so easy to fool?

871
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,740
No.

872
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,180
Don't hit me.

873
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,580
You might not be able to beat me now.

874
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,980
Well,

875
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,140
I'm going to change Sun Lang's shift.

876
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,460
Have an early rest.

877
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,460
I'll go with you.

878
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,820
Nian Tao.

879
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,620
Sun Lang.

880
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,700
Miss Ru Yi.

881
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,100
Come on. Give it to me.

882
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,060
You go back and have an early rest.

883
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,860
Okay.

884
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,660
Let's go.

885
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,820
Lang.

886
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,380
Do you think

887
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,020
Ning Tao doesn't allow us to show our affection to Miss Ren?

888
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,220
Is it because she's a little regretful

889
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,820
because of her own feelings?

890
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,300
Shut up.

891
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,860
Everyone is trying to stop her.

892
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,620
But will Ning Tao

893
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,660
finally obey Miss Ren?

894
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,460
I told you to shut up.

895
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,660
You're not allowed to do that.

896
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,860
You're not allowed to do that.

897
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,060
You're not allowed to do that.

898
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
You're not allowed to do that.

899
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,460
I told you to shut up.

900
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,060
I won't obey.

901
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,380
I've met the female officer

902
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,660
who was close to Ning Tao before.

903
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,460
She's gentle.

904
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,860
Ning Tao likes that kind of thing.

905
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,420
I'll obey.

906
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,060
Why?

907
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,140
No reason.

908
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,300
Because I like

909
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,900
furry and soft animals.

910
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,060
I saw Miss Ren feeding cats last time.

911
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,260
I'm happy

912
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,180
to see her love cats.

913
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,940
You've been with me for so long.

914
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,100
You must have something to say to me.

915
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,180
What's wrong?

916
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,260
Say it.

917
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,020
I want to ask

918
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,300
how you get along with

919
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,620
Yu Shi San and the others.

920
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,940
Why do you ask that?

921
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,220
Her Highness said

922
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,140
I was born with a sword

923
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,220
and I couldn't get along with others.

924
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,060
If she hadn't protected me

925
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,020
and supported me,

926
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,500
I would have died

927
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,860
in the internal battle of Zhu Yi Wei.

928
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,940
She asked me to learn to change.

929
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,780
But I still couldn't.

930
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,180
Whether it's with my aunt

931
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,700
or Ling Long,

932
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,660
we didn't spend much time together.

933
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,700
But I still feel

934
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,300
that we're separated.

935
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,980
But I want to be a mother.

936
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,940
I don't want to be so cold

937
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,220
with my child.

938
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,460
So,

939
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,860
can you teach me?

940
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,940
Have you ever thought

941
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,220
why Her Majesty

942
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,420
wanted you to have a child?

943
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,580
No.

944
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,420
Why not?

945
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,300
Why not?

946
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,900
Her Highness has been helping His Majesty for more than 20 years.

947
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,020
Her eyes and qi are all different.

948
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,820
What she wants me to do

949
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,020
must be for my own good.

950
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,540
I want to do so much.

951
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,060
That's right.

952
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,820
Do you like children?

953
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,540
Of course I like them.

954
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,540
Look at my eyes.

955
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,820
Tell me the truth.

956
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,620
Do you like your child?

957
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,700
Actually,

958
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,860
I don't like him that much.

959
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,700
I hate when my child cries.

960
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,900
Her Highness only has the second prince.

961
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,420
I should like him.

962
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,700
But every time he cries,

963
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,140
I'm so annoyed.

964
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,500
Then I think

965
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
why Her Highness

966
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,340
forced you to do

967
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,220
something you don't like.

968
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,620
I would force Yang Ying

969
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,940
to do something she doesn't like.

970
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,260
It's like practicing martial arts.

971
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,340
At first, no one likes it.

972
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,380
But you get used to it after you learn it.

973
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,340
Anyway,

974
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,940
I will do

975
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,420
what Her Highness asked me to do.

976
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,900
I agree with you.

977
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,780
I remember when I was

978
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,060
in the An's Mansion,

979
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,780
I saw you, the Imperial Guards,

980
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,100
were absolutely good at

981
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,020
obeying orders.

982
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,300
I obeyed

983
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,540
the order of my superior.

984
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,420
I wouldn't change a word.

985
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,860
Her Highness is not

986
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,860
my superior.

987
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,460
Besides,

988
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,380
everyone who enters the Imperial Guards

989
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,260
will be sent to the death

990
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,660
without the permission of the superior.

991
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,460
Isn't it the same with you six?

992
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,500
Of course it's not.

993
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,460
Whether it's Yu Shisan or Qian Zhao,

994
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,020
who can take me as their superior?

995
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,380
You're right.

996
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,020
So,

997
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,060
you

998
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,740
can't control your subordinates

999
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,340
and you were deceived by Zhao Ji

1000
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,780
and ended up in the lower prison.

1001
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,900
You're a good killer.

1002
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,580
You're so hurt when you talk.

1003
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,060
All right.

1004
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,580
Don't be sad.

1005
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,580
When I was in the Imperial Guards,

1006
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,740
there were few

1007
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,620
obedient subordinates.

1008
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:14,780
Tao.

1009
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,820
It's our turn.

1010
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,380
Okay.

1011
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:18,980
Come on.

1012
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:19,860
Thank you.

1013
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,420
Come on.

1014
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,060
Then,

1015
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,380
go back and rest early.

1016
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,380
We'll talk when we have a chance.

1017
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,820
Zhou Shi,

1018
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,660
where are you going.

1019
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,820
Ingredients and Sirs are here.

1020
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,340
Uncle Someone.

1021
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,700
What are you doing at Grape need meaning?

1022
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,300
Not ordinary.

1023
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,380
You even play with her face.

1024
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,260
Don't think too much.

1025
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,140
If you don't tell me,

1026
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,620
I'll keep thinking.

1027
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,620
Okay.

1028
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,100
If you can't say it,

1029
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,020
I'll ask you.

1030
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,820
Are you a little

1031
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,460
like that to her?

1032
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,060
If you want to try, look at your left hand.

1033
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,540
If you don't want to try, look at your right hand.

1034
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,420
No.

1035
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,740
Why?

1036
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,060
No.

1037
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,820
Ruyi is so good.

1038
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,620
You don't like her?

1039
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,820
What's the reason?

1040
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,340
Your brother was good,

1041
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,700
and your 13th brother was good.

1042
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,780
I don't like them either.

1043
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,260
Can it be the same?

1044
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,340
No.

1045
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,660
Why don't you like Ruyi?

1046
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,060
I don't care.

1047
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,540
You have to tell me anyway.

1048
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,900
Why?

1049
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,420
Why don't you like Ruyi?

1050
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,900
Your Ruyi is right.

1051
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,460
What?

1052
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,580
Kids are troublesome.

1053
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,220
If you don't tell me,

1054
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,380
I won't sleep tonight.

1055
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,660
Okay.

1056
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,980
Your Ruyi

1057
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,380
is the most perfect assassin I've ever seen.

1058
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:51,860
Calm,

1059
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,900
very spicy,

1060
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,940
smart,

1061
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,140
and agile.

1062
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,020
As a killer,

1063
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,820
she has almost no shortcomings.

1064
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,180
I remember the first time

1065
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,620
I saw her

1066
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,380
when she was in the army.

1067
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,580
I was surprised.

1068
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,340
At the end of January,

1069
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,900
she was assigned to Chu's Imperial School for seven days.

1070
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,060
I really wanted to

1071
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,100
get her heart back.

1072
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,100
I wanted to see

1073
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,820
who was better, she or me.

1074
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:21,700
No.

1075
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,660
But I didn't expect

1076
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,620
that her heart

1077
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,300
was a girl.

1078
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,460
And she was so young.

1079
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,700
Like a leopard.

1080
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,540
But people like her

1081
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,460
are destined to be in danger.

1082
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,020
But me?

1083
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,180
I did this

1084
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,220
and I'm back to Tianan.

1085
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,860
We're not meant to be.

1086
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:52,980
But...

1087
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,220
But everyone thinks

1088
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,220
you look at Ruyi

1089
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,740
differently.

1090
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,540
It's normal

1091
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,160
for a pretty girl

1092
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,620
to look at the man with sure-è¦‹ eyes.

1093
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,700
It's not creators.

1094
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,540
She is not from much of a off standard.

1095
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,500
It's not that.

1096
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,460
She's always

1097
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,940
looks different.

1098
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,620
You're particular about her.

1099
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,420
Sometimes,

1100
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,700
you treat her better than your Nature.

1101
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,580
Actually,

1102
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,380
I get drowned intezØ§five.

1103
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,300
What's that?

1104
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,300
I'm sorry.

1105
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,340
Your Sister Ruyi,

1106
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,220
although she's a white dove,

1107
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,220
she can seduce many men.

1108
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,340
But sometimes I feel

1109
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,940
she's just like the puppets and woodcutters you made.

1110
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,020
She only knows how to kill

1111
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,660
and how to complete the task.

1112
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,140
But why did she run?

1113
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,380
Why did she jump?

1114
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,460
She never thought about it.

1115
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,580
She never even wanted to think about it.

1116
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,820
She must have suffered a lot

1117
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,180
when she was a red-tailed fox.

1118
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,900
So even if I don't like her at all,

1119
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,580
I want to be nice to her.

1120
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,260
Let her know that in this world,

1121
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,780
besides suicide and giving birth to children,

1122
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,860
there are many interesting things

1123
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,900
as well as

1124
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,380
many things she knows about.

1125
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,220
Ifâ€¦

1126
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,700
I'm sorry.

1127
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,300
Oh no.

1128
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,780
Si Lang.

1129
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,180
Nian Tao.

1130
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,300
Nian Tao.

1131
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,500
