1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
No one in this world

2
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,640
wants to let King Dayang take the throne more than I do.

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,600
But I know better.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,520
The enemy of the Northern Realm is at the front.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The real king will retreat if he doesn't see it.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,720
Your Highness.

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,440
Thank you for what you did just now.

8
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
You're welcome.

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
Even if you're not the empress,

10
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,720
you're just a normal pregnant woman.

11
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,160
I'll help you.

12
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,920
I've always had a question.

13
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,440
Are you and Ning Yanzhou

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,840
really a couple?

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm not sure.

16
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
I'm just a friend.

17
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm not sure.

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm just a friend.

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm not sure.

20
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
I'm not sure.

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm not sure.

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm not sure.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm not sure.

24
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,200
How did you and Ning Yanzhou

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,400
figure out the conspiracy of the Prince of Ying?

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,840
I was born in the Zhu Yi Wei.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
He's from Liudatang.

28
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
We all have the same principle

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,440
when it comes to things.

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
If one thing is too obvious,

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
it depends on who is the most proud.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,840
Who is most likely to be the mastermind?

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
When we arrived in Wu State,

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
we heard that King Dayang...

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,520
No.

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
It's the new emperor.

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,880
He was injured in the temple.

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Coincidentally,

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,680
we also had a conspiracy

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,120
in the An Guo Temple.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,520
We knew that

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
there must be something fishy.

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,600
So you're an expert.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,680
No wonder you're so hard-working

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
when it comes to the Prince of Ying.

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Aren't you afraid?

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,880
Although I've never

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
been out of Wudu,

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I've also dreamt of

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,480
becoming a female warrior when I was young.

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,960
I only envy you

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
for your determination.

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,240
After all,

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,480
no matter how much power

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,080
I had or how much I will have,

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
it's all because of you.

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm a wife

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,200
or a mother.

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
But you're different.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Just as Ning Yuanzhou said,

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,480
your light

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,720
doesn't need to exist because of him.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
Thank you, Miao.

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
No wonder Ying always said

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,880
that you're the best to her.

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,120
You don't want to accept His Majesty's reward.

67
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,360
Then are you willing to be my friend?

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,720
This is the symbol of the Great Wu Empress.

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
Take it.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,200
In the future, when you go out with Ning Yuanzhou

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,720
in the army,

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,400
you may be less troubled.

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,280
f the King andünk

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
increased the title of Miss Min suggestions.

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,160
Although you are wealthy in the world,

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,640
every time a woman gives birth,

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
it's all like crossing the line.

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,520
So

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,200
I want to invest

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Thank you.

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
This is the best gift.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Ning Yuan Zhou is here.

83
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,200
He looks like he's afraid that I'll treat you badly.

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Thank you.

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Take care.

86
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Goodbye.

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Day 3

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Retreat!

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
You're teasing me again.

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
I...

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,200
It's not that I can't tell you.

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
But you have to tell the truth.

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,200
If you didn't do it, it was obviously Ying who did it.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Are you sure that Her Highness will be more at ease when she knows the truth?

95
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
That's right.

96
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Don't tantalize your feelings for me.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Let me hear you.

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Why don't you tell the truth?

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,600
How's it going? Have you getting ready?

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
When you are at the Palace,

101
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,340
everyone will be cleaning up theuję and

102
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,320
NCT adjustments are made,

103
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
and I will deal with 200 men for you.

104
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,280
Okay.

105
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,300
Just tell them to wait outside the City.

106
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,380
We will leave.

107
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,380
Yes.

108
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,260
I was planning to take you back to Ning's old house.

109
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
It's okay.

110
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,140
Anyway, I saw your ancestors and your adoptive father last time.

111
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Yes.

112
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
That's right.

113
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,260
We'll come back together after the war.

114
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,740
And I have experience in fighting.

115
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,660
We will definitely come back safely.

116
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,260
What experience do you have?

117
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,540
I have experience in being a tiger's head soldier.

118
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
I...

119
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,940
You've become a real man, right?

120
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,700
No, no, no.

121
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,500
Shi Yi, Shi Yi.

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,100
No, I mean it.

123
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
Yes.

124
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,180
At the end of the last month of the sixth year of Wu Yongyou,

125
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,740
the Han and Qing dynasties were lost in the river.

126
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,140
They were not able to break out.

127
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,540
The former leftist, Ren Ru Yi,

128
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,020
and the evil Marquis Ning Yuanzhou of Jingyuan,

129
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,220
led the army to the river of the two thousand ten yuan.

130
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Yes.

131
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
Where are the reinforcements?

132
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,220
Everyone, hold on.

133
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,620
There are reinforcements over there.

134
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Yes.

135
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,020
There are reinforcements over there.

136
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
There are reinforcements over there.

137
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
There are reinforcements over there.

138
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
There are reinforcements over there.

139
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,420
The same day, the new King of Sha Xi came out of the prison

140
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,420
to lead the army of the one thousand Sha Xi of the Han State.

141
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Yes.

142
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,420
After the new leftist Wang Gongcheng failed,

143
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,420
he betrayed the wolf lord and planned to fight.

144
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,620
Yang Yan will do everything he can to break out of the river.

145
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
Get ready to shoot.

146
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
Get ready to shoot.

147
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Get ready to shoot.

148
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,620
Get ready to shoot.

149
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
Get ready to shoot.

150
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Get ready to shoot.

151
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Get ready to shoot.

152
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,420
Wu Yong fought for seven years and arrived at the first day of the lunar lunar month.

153
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,620
Deng Hui led the army of the one thousand five hundred yuan of Zhu Yi Wei to arrive at the battlefield.

154
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,420
Under the command of Li Tongguang of the Qing dynasties,

155
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,620
the two armies of the Han and Qing dynasties joined hands

156
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
to fight against the Northern Pan tribe.

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
Come on.

158
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,420
These days,

159
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,460
we've fought outside the city

160
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,140
for many times.

161
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,140
Although we were lucky to win today,

162
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,140
the Northern Regiment only retreated 30 miles.

163
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,860
According to their habits,

164
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,260
they'll attack again in two days.

165
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,980
Don't worry.

166
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,660
Even if the Northern Regiment comes back,

167
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
when the time comes,

168
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,540
His Majesty will come with the main force.

169
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,740
20,000 people from the tribe

170
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,420
will be on the front line.

171
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,940
Not only can they guard the river,

172
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,940
they can also drive the Northern Regiment out of Tianmen Pass.

173
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
That's right.

174
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,060
And I brought 2,000 people here.

175
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,780
A-Ying.

176
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,380
Sister Ruyi.

177
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,740
Didn't I tell you to bring our aunt?

178
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,580
Why did you come here?

179
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,060
Where did you bring 2,000 people from?

180
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,060
Only if you stand in front of me,

181
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
can I only be at ease?

182
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,260
If the core can't be guarded,

183
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,860
the Northern Regiment will pass the Yuzhou River.

184
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,260
And An Du will be in danger.

185
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,660
I don't want to marry you

186
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,460
and become a king.

187
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,860
Instead of staying in the Prime Minister's mansion,

188
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,060
I can't do anything.

189
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,860
I'd rather be in charge of the Yulin Army in An Du,

190
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
and transport the military and weapons

191
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,460
that the people gathered here,

192
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
and help them.

193
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,260
What?

194
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,260
You're not capable enough to take the defeat.

195
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,460
You still want to teach me a lesson?

196
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,860
Yang Ying.

197
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,260
I'm here.

198
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,860
Do you want to yell louder?

199
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,860
I should at least leave some face to her.

200
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,660
Did you see that?

201
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,260
There were a few sheep in this room.

202
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,060
We can finally drink a bowl of hot soup.

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
That's right.

204
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,260
We need a Prime Minister to comfort us.

205
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,060
I heard that

206
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,060
the Prime Minister's wife is the sister of Marquis Ning,

207
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,260
and the apprentice of Madam Ning.

208
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
I think

209
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,860
it's better to have these two people.

210
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,060
With their help,

211
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,260
we can definitely survive to the end.

212
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,860
Thank you.

213
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,260
We won today.

214
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
Our Prime Minister's wife

215
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
brought us a lot of military provisions.

216
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,860
Let's eat.

217
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,460
Okay.

218
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,660
When we defeat the North,

219
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
I'll treat you to some lamb.

220
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,060
Okay.

221
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,860
Okay.

222
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,660
There are military provisions and provisions in the city.

223
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,260
The military is much more peaceful.

224
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,860
Let's go.

225
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,460
You didn't tell everyone the truth, did you?

226
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,460
When will the Emperor's reinforcements arrive?

227
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,660
Don't lie to me.

228
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,860
I really can't hide anything from you.

229
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,060
I'm just a little worried.

230
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,260
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

231
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,660
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

232
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,860
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

233
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,860
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

234
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

235
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,660
Twenty thousand soldiers were supposed to arrive in the city.

236
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,860
On their way, they ran into the Chu people's husband.

237
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,660
Chu?

238
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,860
But don't worry too much.

239
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,660
I just received news.

240
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,860
Chu is in danger and retreating.

241
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Now, the Emperor and the others should be in Xucheng soon.

242
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,460
Thank you.

243
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,460
Help Jiu'er stabilize the army.

244
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,460
It's just a matter of luck.

245
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
In the big picture,

246
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,660
it's about stabilizing the army.

247
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
In the small picture,

248
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,860
it's my duty.

249
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,460
Besides, Ying can come to Hexian with her.

250
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,260
It means that they get along well.

251
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,260
But

252
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,860
Ying and I are like brothers and sisters.

253
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,260
Now, she's married to Li Tongguang.

254
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,060
Li Tongguang's status suddenly increased by half.

255
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,060
It seems that

256
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,260
I can't teach her any more.

257
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,260
Just like how I've taught you,

258
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,260
you're not tired of learning about Yang진짜's politics.

259
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,260
Have you ever thought about what thing you dangerous to do

260
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
before you become a Chopin?

261
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,060
I only take days off after work to learn how to use the About Time Key.

262
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,060
What if you really do learn it by yourself?

263
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,860
In the future,

264
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,260
please guide Ni Changze around this area.

265
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,500
You really learned from Yu Shisan.

266
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,340
You are so good at talking.

267
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,860
I...

268
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,540
I didn't say you are beautiful.

269
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,140
I said

270
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,340
look how beautiful the snow is.

271
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,060
Is it your first time to see the snow?

272
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,540
Of course not.

273
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,100
But

274
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,780
it's the first time to see the snow with you.

275
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,340
I'm not afraid of it.

276
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:26,980
Okay.

277
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,860
I'll watch the snow with you.

278
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,260
Why don't you lean over?

279
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,540
Who made the rule?

280
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,700
What rule?

281
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,980
Isn't it all women

282
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,300
leaning on men's shoulders when watching the snow?

283
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,620
Why can't it be men

284
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,700
leaning on women's shoulders?

285
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,660
I...

286
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,140
You dare not obey?

287
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,300
Of course I won't.

288
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm a man.

289
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,100
I...

290
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,300
How can I not listen to my wife?

291
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,980
Why didn't you let him go in?

292
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,620
He refused.

293
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,460
He said he wanted to share the pain with the soldiers.

294
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,860
You are free.

295
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,100
You worked hard

296
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,740
these days, right?

297
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,220
Anything around the war

298
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,140
you can take care ofSm everyone.

299
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,620
It's good you look out for Cheng Li.

300
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,820
Well,

301
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,260
how is your relationship with Jiu'er?

302
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,440
Are you telling the truth?

303
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,120
It's good.

304
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,920
It's best to meet each other

305
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,120
and be together forever.

306
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,480
Don't worry.

307
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,520
As long as I can survive this time,

308
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,620
even if it's for

309
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,580
the ih lawsuits with the both countries,

310
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,640
I'll be well with him for long.

311
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
to get along with him.

312
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,440
But deep down,

313
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,120
I still miss Yuan Lu.

314
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Today,

315
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,280
Brother Yuan Zhou

316
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,640
gave me his safe.

317
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,000
I will put him

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,640
and the thunder and fireball that Yuan Lu gave me

319
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
together.

320
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
I will put him

321
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
and the thunder and fireball that Yuan Lu gave me

322
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
together.

323
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
A few days ago,

324
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
I saw the thief of the evil knife.

325
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
I remembered him.

326
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Today,

327
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
I saw the fireball that he gave me.

328
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
I remembered him again.

329
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Even if in the future,

330
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
my hair turns white

331
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
and my hair turns white,

332
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
when they are eating candy,

333
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
I will definitely remember him.

334
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I will also remember him.

335
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
I used to...

336
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Why are you crying?

337
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
You said that

338
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
a few months ago,

339
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
I was still living for Zheng Qing Yun.

340
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Now,

341
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
I have become

342
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
the wife of Li Tong Guang.

343
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
But deep down,

344
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
I still miss Yuan Lu.

345
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Isn't that not good?

346
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Who said that?

347
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
As long as the heart is warm,

348
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
women in this life

349
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
will respect

350
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
whether they love only one person

351
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,640
or many people.

352
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Brother Yuan Zhou is dangerous.

353
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
If in a few years,

354
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
he suddenly appears

355
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
with a man who is more beautiful

356
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
and more considerate than him,

357
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
what should we do?

358
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Ying,

359
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
you've grown up.

360
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
No, no.

361
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
How dare you say that your brother Yuan Zhou...

362
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
No, no.

363
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
I'm telling you.

364
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
I won't hit you

365
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
when you grow up.

366
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
I won't...

367
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm just saying.

368
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Here.

369
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Don't be so close to him.

370
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Someone is not confident in himself.

371
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Then,

372
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
what about

373
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
our future child?

374
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,400
let's manage the marriage fairness.

375
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,520
What was it you said earlier?

376
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,800
You tricked me to send you a Gezuang watch.

377
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,900
It was you?

378
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,700
Then can I use it?

379
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,600
I did seriously think about your condition when I checked your racing license,

380
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,720
and I can only hope that you can beat these herself.

381
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
I used to be a fire-tongue soldier.

382
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Wait a bit longer. It'll be ready soon.

383
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
You said before

384
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,920
that you would be scared every time before you carry out a mission.

385
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
What about this time?

386
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,120
This time, I'm not scared at all.

387
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Because you're by my side.

388
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Not to mention,

389
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Sun Lang, Qian Zhao, Ren Lu,

390
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,720
they all became stars and have been with us.

391
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,720
There are no stars in the daytime.

392
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,720
I think people won't become stars.

393
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,720
There may not be any six-leafed reincarnation in the world.

394
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
People die like lights out.

395
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
There won't be a next life.

396
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,720
But because people can only live once,

397
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
we understand the value of life better.

398
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Although I was comforting my aunt just now,

399
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,720
I'm actually scared this time.

400
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
I'm scared.

401
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
What if the nuclear wire can't hold me?

402
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
When I die,

403
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
you're not by my side.

404
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
It won't.

405
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I promise.

406
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
You never break your promise.

407
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,720
You said you'd give me a child.

408
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
But you broke your promise.

409
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
You've been married for so long.

410
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
You still haven't got a child.

411
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
I understand now.

412
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
So you're waiting for me here.

413
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
It seems you're just a little demon

414
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
who's killing me.

415
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Say it.

416
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm not alive, but I'm still alive.

417
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I just want to live.

418
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Who can't see through the mist,

419
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,720
but the sudden change in my heart?

420
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Who understands that my heart is like the wind

421
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,720
and that it's like the sky above?

422
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
If there's a next life,

423
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,720
I'll look back again.

424
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,720
If there's a next life,

425
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,720
I'll look back again.

426
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Who understands that my heart is like the wind

427
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,720
and that it's like the sky above?

428
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,720
If there's a next life,

429
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,720
I'll look back again.

430
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,720
If there's a next life,

431
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
I'll ask you for it.

432
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,360
Can't you help me?

433
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,360
Maybe...

434
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,480
Maybe the North Rebellion will attack us.

435
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,600
I might die on the spot.

436
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Is it that hard to ask you to help me?

437
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Pei Pei Pei,

438
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
you're a mouth of a crow.

439
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,200
You don't believe me?

440
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Don't worry.

441
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,200
I promise you.

442
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
I, Yu Shisan,

443
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,200
will use the greatest power in my life

444
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,600
to protect this place.

445
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
I promise you

446
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
that in the next few decades,

447
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,200
you'll live happily

448
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
and be beautiful.

449
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,400
I don't want to listen to the future.

450
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,600
Just say it's us now.

451
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
You obviously like me.

452
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
You've been with me these days.

453
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,400
You've been with me in battles,

454
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
comforting me,

455
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
and encouraging me.

456
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,800
I can feel

457
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,400
whatever you want from me.

458
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,800
Yes.

459
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
I like you.

460
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,800
But I also like beautiful women.

461
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
I like you.

462
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,200
I like Princess Ying.

463
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
I like all the lovely women

464
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in this world.

465
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
I,

466
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
my biggest wish in my life is

467
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,800
to drink the best wine,

468
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,400
make the best friends,

469
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
fight the most happy battles,

470
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
and see the most beautiful girls.

471
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
So,

472
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I just want to drink the best wine.

473
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
Just drink the best wine.

474
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,000
Love all friends,

475
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:40,280
just like

476
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,600
a Control Seal SSD.

477
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
It's too late to stop.

478
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Because of moral responsibility

479
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I'm afraid we can't be apart in this life

480
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
You want us to be together for the rest of our lives

481
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
To see each other

482
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
To give each other

483
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,400
But maybe we can't live tomorrow

484
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Where are you going to fly?

485
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Fly to the point where you can't fly

486
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Fly to

487
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Last moment

488
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I don't care, I won't let you go

489
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm the queen of Sha Xi

490
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I order you

491
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
I won't let you go

492
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
I won't let you go

493
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
I want you to be with me

494
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
I want you to be with me

495
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

496
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

497
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Look, the snow flower is alive

498
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

499
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

500
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,400
I have no way to retreat

501
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Remember

502
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Whether you are the queen of Sha Xi

503
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Or the little bride of ordinary people

504
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Don't be involved in the kiss

505
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Please entrust yourself

506
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
You have a way

507
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I'm afraid the dream is too beautiful

508
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:36,400
I'm afraid I will regret it

509
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:44,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

510
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm afraid I will regret it

511
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm afraid the dream is too beautiful

512
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:06,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

513
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

514
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm afraid I will regret it

515
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm afraid the world is in a mess

516
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:35,400
I will never regret the dream I had.

517
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,000
Can you be faster?

518
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,680
We are in contact with the bandits in Ningyuan.

519
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
They can't hold on.

520
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
But Your Majesty,

521
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,400
the soldiers are exhausted.

522
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,200
We don't know when the snow will stop falling.

523
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
We can't speed up.

524
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
Hurry up!

525
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Yes.

526
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Is there no man in your country?

527
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,080
Not a single man is fighting.

528
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,280
Where are they?

529
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Bring them here!

530
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
Yuan Zheng,

531
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
how is it?

532
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,480
The North sent soldiers to kill.

533
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,880
They didn't come to attack the city today.

534
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Instead, they let Prince Zuojie come out to call for the formation.

535
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
Is there any fault in this?

536
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,080
We will guard the city gate first.

537
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
If anything happens, we will go down immediately.

538
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,080
We don't want to die, General.

539
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,880
Listen to me, people of Anguo.

540
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,080
Either surrender or...

541
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,680
Your Highness,

542
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,080
these are the comrades who fought with us several times.

543
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,280
Your Highness,

544
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,080
you can't be soft-hearted at this time.

545
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,280
These are comrades.

546
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,080
Those in Hexian are also comrades.

547
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,080
If we fall now, we will be defeated.

548
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Help!

549
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
You are right.

550
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,480
We are carrying the lives of thousands of people in Hexian.

551
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,080
We can't be soft-hearted.

552
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,680
But I can't do it on the body of my comrades.

553
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,080
Everyone, stand up!

554
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,680
Let's split up immediately.

555
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,080
Turn around and attack the city gate.

556
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,480
Kill!

557
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,480
This won't do.

558
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
We will split into two groups and the number of soldiers will be reduced to half.

559
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,280
Our people are not that many.

560
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,880
As long as the wolf and the mouse come from there,

561
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
we will be the ones being surrounded.

562
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,680
Commandant Jiang, guard the city gate.

563
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,480
Okay.

564
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,280
Add up the numbers!

565
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,080
Ru Yi,

566
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,080
San, go down with me and save Duke Qing.

567
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,680
Yes.

568
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,080
Go!

569
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,680
Go over there and attack the tail.

570
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,480
Meet up with Ru Yi and the others.

571
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,080
Okay.

572
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,880
Save me, Duke Qing!

573
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,680
Duke Qing!

574
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,080
You can't go! Be careful of the trap!

575
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
He has been following me since he was little.

576
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,080
De Huin.

577
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,680
De Huin!

578
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,680
De Huin.

579
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
On the battlefield,

580
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,480
you can't be soft-hearted.

581
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,480
As the archer,

582
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,480
you can't be tough.

583
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
You must be strong.

584
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
You must be strong.

585
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
You must be strong.

586
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
You must be strong.

587
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
You must be strong.

588
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
De Huin.

589
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,680
De Huin!

590
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,480
De Huin!

591
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,080
Take the horse and send him back to the city.

592
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,880
Master.

593
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,680
Let go!

594
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,480
I caused his death.

595
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
I can't go!

596
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
I was fooled by the last one.

597
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,680
This time, I'll have to explain it to him.

598
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,080
What are you talking about?

599
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,680
We've been through so much.

600
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,480
We've never seen anything like this.

601
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,680
There's a horse over there.

602
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
We've snatched Ma Qing's soul.

603
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,080
No.

604
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,480
The two of them are too strong.

605
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
You go this way.

606
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,880
There's a cavalry there.

607
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,080
I'll go get his horse.

608
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,480
Wait.

609
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,080
Do you regret it, Duke Qing?

610
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Do you regret it?

611
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
I'll trick you out of the Palace of Beautiful Princess.

612
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
What's the point of regretting it?

613
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
I, Yu Shi Sai,

614
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
will drink the most fierce wine in my life.

615
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I'll look at the most beautiful girl.

616
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,480
I'll make the best friends.

617
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,080
I'll fight the most beautiful battles.

618
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
I'll go first.

619
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Sister Cheng Li!

620
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Sister Cheng Li!

621
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Sister Cheng Li!

622
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Sister Cheng Li!

623
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Sister Cheng Li!

624
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Cheng Yue!

625
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Go!

626
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Take care of her.

627
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
I'll take you back.

628
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,620
Yu Chi Sen!

629
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,120
Let's hide and serve for the Resurrection Four continue to fight!

630
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,400
troubling

631
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,160
bar

632
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,280
Yu Sh label

633
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,800
Yu Sh label

634
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,880
Yu Sh label

635
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,880
Yu Sh label

636
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
I'm here.

637
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Are you okay?

638
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Are you hurt?

639
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
What's wrong with my eyes?

640
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
My eyes are so wide open.

641
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
It's okay.

642
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
It's just a small scratch.

643
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Don't rub it.

644
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Go back and wash it with clean water.

645
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
You can see it again.

646
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
What if I'm blind?

647
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
You won't.

648
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
If you're blind,

649
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
I'll be the most romantic person

650
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
you've ever seen in your life.

651
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,080
I'll be the most romantic person

652
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
you've ever seen in your life.

653
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Are you okay?

654
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Are you okay?

655
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
I'm Yu Shisan.

656
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
How could anything happen to me?

657
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Come on, get up.

658
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Let's go.

659
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Come on, get up.

660
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
How is it?

661
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Can you see the gate?

662
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
Okay.

663
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
That's good.

664
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
You go back first.

665
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Where are you going?

666
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
Why don't you go with me?

667
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
You're still waiting for my hero to save you.

668
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
How can he miss me?

669
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Don't worry.

670
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I'll be back in a minute.

671
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
I'll be back in a minute.

672
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,080
You'll meet your star sooner or later.

673
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
It's impossible.

674
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
If I meet it,

675
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
I'll die.

676
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
You'll meet your star sooner or later.

677
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
It's impossible.

678
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
If I meet it,

679
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
I'll die.

680
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
You go out of the hospital

681
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
and use a gold leaf to buy me Yu Shisan.

682
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
I'll be happy with you.

683
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Jiao Yun,

684
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
call me Yu Shisan.

685
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Yu Shisan,

686
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
I have many treasures.

687
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Can you sell them all tonight?

688
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
If I really help you,

689
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
I'm afraid I'll never be able to share them again.

690
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Yu Shisan!

691
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Yu Shisan!

692
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Yu Shisan!

693
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Yu Shisan!

694
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Yu Shisan!

695
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Yu Shisan!

696
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,080
I want to spend the winter snow

697
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
with you.

698
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,080
How many years have passed?

699
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,080
I want to spend the rest of my life

700
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,080
with you.

701
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,080
I want to spend the rest of my life

702
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,080
with you.
