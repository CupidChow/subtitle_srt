5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The last one

6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Come

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Look

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Dong

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dong

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dong

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Dong

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Dong

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Dong

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it a boy?

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If I lie, he will jump around

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Dong

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh no

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's cold

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I haven't come out for a long time

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I haven't seen Da Yu for a long time

21
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The old patient likes Chen Zai again

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is the wrong demonstration

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Men are best at using this trick to seduce the young lady in love

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Remember to be careful in the future

25
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What are you laughing at?

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm really a bad person

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I know, I know you are a bad person

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Drink

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You are so bad

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You want to be drunk?

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What cup?

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Come

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The whole bottle

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I drink

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can drink as you like

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You can't be like this at all

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm drunk

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How can I not be able to drink you?

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You don't even look at who I am

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I grew up in Sha Xi Bu

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In our Sha Xi Bu, anyone can drink

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Awesome, awesome, I'm convinced

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I say a few words

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are a bad person

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have seen too few good men

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's why I'm so sad for a bad man

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll take you to a good place later

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Happy happy

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Once you get used to the world

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's not because of a few stinky fish

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can't sleep

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then you have to talk

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Then clap

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Clap

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No no no

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We can't meet again

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You are so beautiful

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't control it

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There will be another sad little girl in this world

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I will

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can't go

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Su Zhou

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you go, I will

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll tell everyone about you

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll tell everyone

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Grandma

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You either kill me today

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Or you just stay here and play with me

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You have to burn yourself with fire

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I tell you

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm not a saint

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm a wolf

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wolf

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Wolf, do you know

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If I can't control it, I'm done

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't care

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This man has broken my heart

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now even you want to break my heart

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Have you got money?

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's easy

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You will be discharged

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Use a gold treasure

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Buy me Yun Shisan

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm happy with you

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We are only business

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No feelings no promises

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No tomorrow

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's dawn and you don't know me

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know you

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What a clear line

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Teng Yi Bo

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You are called Yun Shisan

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You should have said

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I finally know

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Your name is Yun Shisan

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you know

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's go.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You are...

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No, Yu Shi San.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Come here.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How is it?

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What is this?

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you afraid of?

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Look at your belt.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What are you afraid of?

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's go.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Small.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Small.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Small.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Small.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Small.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Small.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Small.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Small.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Small.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Three to six.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The game is over.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's go.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Small.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Drink.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ok.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sir, your drink.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Cheers.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Cheers.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yu Shi San.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How do you know so many interesting things?

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't ask.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Just have a beautiful dream.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Just ask.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Dream is enough.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why did you let me go?

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You bastard.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Stop.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't fight with men.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't do it.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't leave without turning around.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Otherwise, things will be difficult.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
See, it's difficult.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's difficult.

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
How to solve it now?

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Second trick.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Please.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't go, ok?

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I have something to do.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't leave you.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ok.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I won't go.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You have to be like this.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Poor Chu Chu doesn't talk.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But you don't let her go.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
How to get rid of headache?

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How to get rid of headache?

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let men do it.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Go to bed.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Get off.

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not you.

165
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,820
I can't.

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Not you.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm a wanderer, not a beast.

168
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
She's just a woman who's been hurt by love.

169
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I just can't stand seeing a girl with a broken heart

170
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,640
help her through this.

171
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,640
There are so many women who have been hurt by love.

172
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Why don't you care about them?

173
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,640
She's the type you like the most.

174
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
She's a bit hot, a bit pitiful, and a bit unusual.

175
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
You're in love. Don't try to fool me.

176
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm in love.

177
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
What's wrong with me being in love?

178
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,280
When did I ever see a woman who's never been hurt by love?

179
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Besides, when I saw you,

180
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
you were all hurt.

181
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I was in love too.

182
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
You!

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
What do you mean?

184
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
I'm telling you,

185
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm giving you face when I'm with you in front of everyone.

186
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,280
You're the one who's feeling guilty.

187
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
When I'm with you,

188
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
am I not good to you?

189
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Yes.

190
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
ondo

191
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,880
I'm angry.

192
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Why do you have so much to say?

193
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
It's justoder

194
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
Did I say this?

195
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Such an innocent person

196
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,920
I've been APPLAUSEED

197
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
I've heard that there are many other people.

198
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
I agreed to spend my time with you,

199
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,560
but should I be장을

200
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,720
When I was with you,

201
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
I never saw other women, right?

202
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,720
You said you would do it.

203
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,720
But I just don't want to.

204
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,040
You finally cleared my name.

205
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,280
If you didn't force me to marry you,

206
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I wouldn't have run away.

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,920
But you can't just leave like that.

208
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,240
I said it at midnight.

209
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,240
I was about to break into the crowd.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,080
It's a little bit inappropriate.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
But I'm afraid.

212
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
Yu Shi San.

213
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,280
Have you ever loved me?

214
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes.

215
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,960
But I love every little girl

216
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,600
who has been with me.

217
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,560
I love her sincerely.

218
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,240
But you just don't want to stop for us.

219
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,280
How can I stop?

220
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm a wanderer.

221
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
Do you know that?

222
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,840
Have you ever seen a wanderer stop?

223
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,400
It's a dead end.

224
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,840
Have you ever loved me?

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,320
Do you want me to die?

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
No.

227
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,760
If you hadn't saved me,

228
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,160
if you hadn't escaped at midnight,

229
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
I wouldn't have come to the Sand Gang.

230
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,680
So I'm lucky.

231
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,360
Drink this.

232
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,200
Our grudges will be over.

233
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,600
You're beautiful and skillful.

234
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,800
Sometimes you're in trouble.

235
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,640
You're just a fool.

236
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
Even if you don't meet the right person,

237
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,600
you'll be in trouble.

238
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,200
Once you blow away the sand,

239
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
you can still be saved.

240
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Yu Shi San.

241
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,160
You're a bad mouth.

242
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,520
You're a bad person.

243
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,160
I can live for a thousand years

244
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,200
to see you smoke.

245
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
I wish you will meet the one

246
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,920
who can control you one day.

247
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,120
I'll be the first one to come.

248
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,920
I'll see how miserable you are.

249
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,520
There won't be that day.

250
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,880
Because I don't want you to be sad.

251
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,320
God!

252
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,760
Father.

253
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,480
Do you want me to revenge?

254
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
Who can revenge for me?

255
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
No bunch of assholes, I dare not touch him because I am illiterate11

256
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:16,860
Hey you has wrong also

257
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,920
Who is she?

258
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,900
Your Majesty

259
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Your Majesty, what should we do?

260
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,720
Who is she?

261
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Why I can't remember his name?

262
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Tell me his name.

263
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,720
He used to be with the Empress.

264
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
What's his name?

265
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
It's me!

266
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,720
His Majesty is the one who mentioned his name in the palace.

267
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,720
He is the former left guard of the Imperial Guards.

268
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
OK.

269
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
How could it be the stone?

270
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,720
He didn't die. He killed the First Prince.

271
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,720
He wants to avenge the Empress.

272
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Chun Deng Hui, immediately, immediately!

273
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

274
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
You said before,

275
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,720
that the one who died with Duke Wang,

276
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
there is a person called...

277
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Tao Wei?

278
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Are you hinting at something?

279
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Say it.

280
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
The one who killed the First Prince,

281
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
the one who killed them,

282
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,720
is this person a woman?

283
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,720
A woman is called a human heart.

284
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Were you also suspecting at that time?

285
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Your Majesty, please help me.

286
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Then why didn't you say it clearly at that time?

287
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Why?

288
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I am guilty.

289
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
You are guilty.

290
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Hiding and deceiving the Emperor,

291
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,720
that is a death sentence.

292
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I am just guilty.

293
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
I still haven't found any evidence that shows my heart is alive.

294
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Then find it for me!

295
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Find it and kill it!

296
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Don't think that I only killed your men last time,

297
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
and didn't touch you.

298
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
You just passed the trial.

299
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Go and hand the Fifth Brother to the Palace Guards.

300
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
You focus on finding the human heart.

301
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,720
The one who I can't see for half a month,

302
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
that is your body.

303
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Get lost!

304
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Yes.

305
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,720
His Majesty is also very fond of you.

306
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
It's my turn.

307
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
I'll take revenge.

308
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
I'll go.

309
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,720
I am lucky that it wasn't the men who were killed.

310
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Otherwise, I can't even leave the Palace.

311
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Your Majesty.

312
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
His Majesty also guessed it was a human heart.

313
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Even if I don't want to arrest him,

314
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,720
there's still a chance of a death sentence in his life.

315
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,720
The Imperial Guards are very suspicious of Wei Zhong.

316
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I only heard that he has a few relatives, but they are all dead.

317
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
He has been alone all the time.

318
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Except for the order of the Empress,

319
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
he has given it to Marquis Changxin.

320
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,720
But these days, we have been watching Marquis Changxin.

321
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
He hasn't made any move.

322
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
This is a bit strange.

323
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Check it.

324
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Yes.

325
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,720
Salish.

326
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Be careful. I am Hurma Water.

327
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Halloween House

328
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,720
How did you get here?

329
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
Your Highness, when did you come back?

330
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,040
You didn't come back last night.

331
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,320
I was so worried.

332
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,800
I just came in to clean up.

333
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,160
There's no one in the room.

334
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,160
Why did you...

335
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,520
Why did you...

336
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,040
You had a beautiful dream.

337
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,880
You woke up when you asked.

338
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Is it really just a dream?

339
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,960
What did you say?

340
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,920
Nothing.

341
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
By the way,

342
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,480
can you help me find out

343
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
if there's any case

344
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,680
in Yongan Temple recently?

345
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,200
Case?

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,880
Are you talking about

347
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,720
the fire in Yongan Temple last night?

348
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,720
Think about it.

349
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,680
Although we were spheres not Thai Earth,

350
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,840
she can spin such a cyclic circle of speech.

351
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,160
Quy Anh,

352
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,520
I'll tell you.

354
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,960
Why is there a way to Hhouses of Pull霊?

355
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,940
It's your other тепed

356
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,640
policies

357
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
that I'll take on.

358
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,840
I've made it clear to her that we owe each other.

359
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,080
Meiniang just texted me.

360
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,320
She said she was worried.

361
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,360
So she was asked to be her identity.

362
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,480
She's the daughter of Duke Chu, Chu Yue.

363
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,720
I know.

364
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,880
She told me as soon as she met me.

365
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,080
Do you know that

366
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,800
she's the wife of Marquis Changqing of Wei's.

367
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Marquis Changqing?

368
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,920
It's true that Marquis Changqing has a wife of Wei's.

369
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,600
But I can't remember her name.

370
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,280
I didn't expect that she's Chu Yue.

371
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,040
Oh, no.

372
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,400
I drank with her last night.

373
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
And I gave her a lesson last night.

374
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,560
Do you know what I said?

375
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
I taught her how to seduce my husband

376
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,040
and take back his heart.

377
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,120
Just drink all night?

378
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Of course.

379
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,520
Why didn't you come?

380
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
Tell me the truth.

381
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,440
Did you harm her?

382
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,200
No.

383
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,680
I really didn't.

384
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
Please help me.

385
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,040
Please help me.

386
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,000
Please help me.

387
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,200
I can't help you.

388
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Li Dongguang is her apprentice.

389
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,440
You're my brother.

390
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,840
You're a brother of a robber.

391
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,960
You're a traitor.

392
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,760
As for Duke Yu,

393
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,160
Li Dongguang is cooperating with us.

394
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,800
If you delay the mission,

395
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,160
you'll be in trouble.

396
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
You can handle it yourself.

397
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
Meiren.

398
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,960
I swear I didn't do anything to her.

399
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,800
I didn't say anything

400
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,440
about our operation.

401
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,120
Others don't understand me.

402
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,960
Don't you understand?

403
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,320
Tao.

404
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,720
Tao.

405
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,760
What's wrong?

406
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,240
According to the report of Dufen Hall's brothers,

407
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,960
the An Guoyuan Formation is going to be transferred.

408
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
Which direction?

409
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,400
Up.

410
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,200
The guards in the guard post are all from the front.

411
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,920
They're going to the west.

412
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,640
They're probably going to Donghu Grassland.

413
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,520
Donghu Grassland?

414
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,280
The Hu Xin Island you mentioned?

415
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,720
Donghu Grassland was originally

416
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,160
a place for the cultivation of the land.

417
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,600
They chose the Hu Xin Island of Donghu

418
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,400
to stay away from the red dust.

419
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,680
Later,

420
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,240
Emperor An took a fancy to this place

421
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,040
and expanded it into a prison.

422
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,320
It was used to imprison the imperial concubines

423
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,240
who had not been executed but committed a serious crime.

424
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,560
In order to prevent someone from stealing grass from the land

425
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,680
and changing the roof of the old house

426
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,040
that was once covered with weeds,

427
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,000
they no longer allowed ordinary people to enter.

428
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,200
Only two ships on the island

429
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,000
could get out.

430
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,560
The prisoners could only live in the house in the center.

431
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,520
There were many people outside the house.

432
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,680
When people stepped on it, they would make a noise.

433
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
If outsiders wanted to break in,

434
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,040
there were small rooms in the south.

435
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,720
There were building buildings in the northwest and southeast.

436
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,080
There were swordsmen in the buildings.

437
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,800
In the high and low underground guard post,

438
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,760
the prisoners would be in a difficult situation.

439
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,560
But fortunately, I've been there before.

440
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,360
As long as there are no changes,

441
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
the structure inside

442
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,360
won't change much.

443
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,160
Mr. Sun,

444
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,560
go to the secret room to check.

445
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,160
Check the records of the East Lake and the soil in recent years.

446
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,960
Okay.

447
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,480
It seems that it's not difficult to capture this place.

448
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,280
At least it's easier than Yongan Tower.

449
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,480
It's not as easy as you think.

450
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,560
There are at least 100 pages in this island.

451
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,760
If we use the ship to guide the island,

452
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,320
it will take too long to come and go.

453
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
The fastest speed

454
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
will also take a lot of time.

455
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,320
In this process,

456
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,160
whether it's the defense on the island

457
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,360
or the guards on the shore,

458
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,480
once they find us,

459
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,080
we have nowhere to escape.

460
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,160
Then let me plan the evacuation.

461
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,440
Okay.

462
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
Let's split up.

463
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,560
Later,

464
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
you and your brother

465
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,240
take His Highness to the East Lake and the soil.

466
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,840
Although they won't let you in,

467
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,040
at least they can investigate.

468
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,240
Okay.

469
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,200
Okay, let's go.

470
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,780
took you 10 years

471
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:52,280
No one

472
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,360
Why haven't you come out yet?

473
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Let's pack up.

474
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Let's go.

475
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
What's wrong with this painting?

476
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I just want to ask the county magistrate something.

477
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
If you don't want to, I'll meet you.

478
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I am the chief commander Deng Hui.

479
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Please tell me.

480
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Why is the county magistrate suddenly here?

481
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
It's very lively.

482
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
You didn't go with Marquis Changning?

483
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
I heard you two had a fight.

484
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
So I came here to drink alone.

485
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
When will I not drink with him?

486
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
If dad didn't force me all day,

487
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
I wouldn't want to see him.

488
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,160
That day, when you met Marquis Changning

489
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
at the horse farm outside the city,

490
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
did you see anyone else?

491
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Other people? You mean...

492
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Marquis, Xiaosi...

493
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Other people?

494
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
No.

495
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
If the county magistrate asks,

496
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,160
is Li Tongguang doing something wrong?

497
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
If he has any situation, you must tell me in time.

498
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I'll ask the people of Sha Xi Department to help you investigate.

499
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
The marriage decree hasn't been issued yet.

500
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
If I can get him to be punished,

501
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
I don't need to marry him.

502
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
You're thinking too much.

503
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm just doing a routine investigation.

504
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Excuse me.

505
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Don't. It's not over yet.

506
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
Okay.

507
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
That's it.

508
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,160
In short, I didn't tell that woman anything.

509
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Thank you.

510
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
She's very important to me.

511
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
It's not important.

512
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,160
But he didn't mean to do it for nothing.

513
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Don't misunderstand.

514
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
If you want to get him back,

515
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
you have to learn to be soft first.

516
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Seeing a little lady

517
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
giving herself a hard time.

518
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Mister, I'm sorry.

519
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I was wrong.

520
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Most men will feel guilty.

521
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm sorry.

522
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I shouldn't have followed him that day.

523
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
But I can't control myself.

524
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
I was angry that day.

525
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
I was too much.

526
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Here's the point.

527
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Once he feels guilty,

528
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
you have to cry.

529
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
A woman's tears,

530
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
a man's knife,

531
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
and a knife of the devil.

532
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
When he feels soft,

533
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
grab the opportunity

534
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
and hold his hand.

535
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I usually wear strange clothes

536
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
like a kid.

537
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,160
But I will get hurt,

538
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
and I will be sad.

539
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Once a man and a woman have a relationship,

540
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
everything will be different.

541
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
At this time,

542
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
you have to lean on him.

543
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Then tell him

544
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
to let me lean on him for a while.

545
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Just for a while.

546
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Let me lean on him for a while.

547
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Just for a while.

548
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Let me lean on him for a while.

549
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Just for a while.

550
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Just for a while.

551
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Just for a while.

552
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Just for a while.

553
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Just for a while.

554
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Just for a while.

555
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Just for a while.

556
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Just for a while.

557
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Just for a while.

558
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Just for a while.

559
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Just for a while.

560
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Just for a while.

561
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Just for a while.

562
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Just for a while.

563
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Just for a while.

564
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Just for a while.

565
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Just for a while.

566
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Just for a while.

567
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Just for a while.

568
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Just for a while.

569
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Just for a while.

570
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Just for a while.

571
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Just for a while.

572
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Just for a while.

573
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Just for a while.

574
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Just for a while.

575
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Just for a while.

576
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Just for a while.

577
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Look.

578
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Just for a while.

579
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Just for a while.

580
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Just for a while.

581
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Just for a while.

582
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Just for a while.

583
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Let me ask you.

584
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
How did you fall in love with that

585
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,160
woman that you could even give up your life for?

586
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
She suddenly appeared.

587
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
I didn't have any feelings at first.

588
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
But then,

589
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,160
I suddenly fell in love with her.

590
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Let me ask you one last question.

591
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
The reason you gave me flowers that day

592
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
was really just because you were in a good mood?

593
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Of course.

594
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
She...

595
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
talked to me that day.

596
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
I was so happy.

597
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Then I'll make you feel better.

598
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Mr. Li.

599
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
From now on, we'll be a fake couple.

600
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
We won't even use each other as soldiers.

601
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Someone told me that

602
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
as long as I'm willing to be soft,

603
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
as long as I'm willing to shed tears,

604
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
I can save you.

605
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
But after trying half of it,

606
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
I found it boring.

607
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
We didn't like each other at first.

608
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Then we just agreed to work together

609
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
and then we were reluctant to meet.

610
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
You...

611
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
You're really pretty.

612
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
A girl like you

613
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
always hopes that her husband

614
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
will be kind and considerate

615
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
and be sincere to herself.

616
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
That's why I'm so sad.

617
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
But now I've figured it out.

618
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
I'm sad

619
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
because of my own pride.

620
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
It has nothing to do with you.

621
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
I just want you to take back

622
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
the words you look down on me.

623
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,160
I'm a better man out of the hospital.

624
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
I don't need to put all my hopes

625
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
on you.

626
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Does your father know about this?

627
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Of course he does.

628
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,160
We have to act in front of others.

629
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Then I'll cooperate with you.

630
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
But if you can do something big,

631
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
I want a position.

632
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
Someone who has the right to

633
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
serve his own army.

634
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
What do you think?

635
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Deal.

636
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
I don't have to pretend to be a good man

637
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
in front of you anymore.

638
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Go out and tell others

639
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
that I had another fight

640
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
in your mansion today

641
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
because Deng Hui

642
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
made trouble for you.

643
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
We didn't just have a fight.

644
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
We even had a fight.

645
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Then you definitely won't win

646
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
because you dare not

647
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
disturb our trip abroad.

648
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Before we leave tomorrow,

649
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
remember to put some

650
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
acupoints on your face.

651
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Goodbye.

652
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Wait.

653
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Did you say these words

654
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
because you fell in love with

655
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
another man?

656
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Don't misunderstand.

657
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm just worried that

658
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
if I show up,

659
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
how to explain to Ling Zun?

660
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
I can only say

661
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,160
that I spent a lot of money last night

662
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
to buy a handsome man a bowl.

663
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
He showed me a lot of

664
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
rare and strange things.

665
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
He also told me

666
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
that I was beautiful and good.

667
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Anyway,

668
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
he opened a window for me.

669
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
I look down on you.

670
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
What did the Marquis tell you just now?

671
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Why are you so happy?

672
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
I had a beautiful dream.

673
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
I want to see

674
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
if it's true.

675
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
The people of the courier station are looking for me?

676
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Why don't you go to Lao Ning?

677
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
You don't see us every day.

678
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
I have some small things to deal with him.

679
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
You go ahead.

680
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
It's really you.

681
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Why are you here?

682
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
You really have a good taste.

683
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
You look different every day

684
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
than the night.

685
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Yes, I do.

686
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Am I handsome?

687
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Wait.

688
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Let's go to another place.

689
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
Someone will find us here.

690
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Okay.

691
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Let's go.

692
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Don't worry.

693
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
The steward of the courier station

694
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
is from Sha Xi Bu.

695
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
He won't tell anyone.

696
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
And I'm from the door of the grocery store.

697
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
No one followed me.

698
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I want to tell you something.

699
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
The people of the courier station

700
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
have been watching me

701
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
for the Marquis Chang Qing.

702
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Although I pretended to be stupid

703
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
and tried to deal with them,

704
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm still worried

705
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
if someone saw us

706
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
in the Golden Sand House yesterday.

707
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
Will it be you?

708
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Thank you.

709
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Don't worry.

710
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
The people in the Golden Sand House

711
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
are all in the business.

712
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
We all have a tacit understanding.

713
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
We won't talk nonsense.

714
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
That's good.

715
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
You're different every day

716
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
than the night.

717
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
The night is a little girl

718
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
who is very stubborn.

719
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
But in the daytime,

720
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
it's really like

721
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
the meaning of the master of Sha Xi Bu.

722
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
I'll just take it as a compliment.

723
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
By the way,

724
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
I told him everything

725
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
about the trouble

726
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
I caused to the Marquis Chang Qing.

727
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Of course you should tell him.

728
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
You have a marriage contract.

729
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
You can't just let it go.

730
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
And you tell him

731
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
that you have a marriage contract with him.

732
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
It's just right

733
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
to make you two get back together.

734
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Do you remember what I told you last night?

735
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Yes.

736
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
That's good.

737
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Yuxi San, last night...

738
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Last night...

739
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
It's over.

740
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
Okay.

741
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
I'm leaving.

742
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Bye.

743
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Yuxi San,

744
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
I have many treasures.

745
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Can I buy you more tonight?

746
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
I'm a criminal.

747
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
I'm a scoundrel.

748
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
I'm a thief.

749
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
You're a good girl.

750
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,160
A good girl who's a good girl.

751
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
If you're in a bad mood,

752
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
you can go out and have fun.

753
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
You just don't have much experience.

754
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
You'll know when you go to the Golden Sand House.

755
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
As long as you have money,

756
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
there are many young people

757
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
who will make you famous.

758
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Remember to tell me your name when you go to the Golden Sand House.

759
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
The owner will give you a discount.

760
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm sorry.

761
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Take care.

762
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
I'm sorry.

763
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Give a discount on your name.

764
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Are you sure that Jin Meiniang

765
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
won't break your leg?

766
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I saw it.

767
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
You saw it?

768
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
You're here to report a letter,

769
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
not to avenge.

770
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
This is over.

771
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
You two don't have to mention it again.

772
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
What do you mean?

773
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Who is this?

774
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Chu Yue.

775
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
He's Chu Yue?

776
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
You don't know him?

777
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
What's wrong?

778
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Last time he followed me

779
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
and said that he was Chu Yue's maid.

780
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
I gave him to Jiu'er

781
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
and let him handle it by himself.

782
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
So you don't know Chu Yue either.

783
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Have you finished the plan to get on the island?

784
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Last year, Yuan Lu

785
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
dared to build a slide.

786
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm also wearing it this time.

787
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
I think it's just right to use on the island.

788
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Later, let's find an empty place

789
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
to practice.

790
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Okay.

791
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
Let's go.

792
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
Xiao Xiao.

793
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
No one is here.

794
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Retreat.

795
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Jin Meiniang must have received the news.

796
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
An Shao who was in charge of the security guard

797
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
outside the military building

798
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
was not bought by him.

799
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
So he closed the An Du branch

800
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
for safety reasons.

801
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,160
An Shao didn't increase

802
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
outside the private building.

803
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
That means

804
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Deng Hui doesn't know

805
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
how to hide himself.

806
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
But we can't hide.

807
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
I have to leave the private building immediately.

808
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Otherwise, I will involve you.

809
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
But there are people chasing after you.

810
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
Besides, the Golden Sands Tower is closed.

811
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Where are you going to hide?

812
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Since the day I planned to assassinate the prince,

813
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
I never thought about hiding.

814
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
Instead of hiding,

815
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
I'd rather take the initiative.

816
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
An Du is my old territory.

817
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Don't worry.

818
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
I'll listen to you.

819
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
But our action

820
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
must be done in advance.

821
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
I was just about to say

822
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
it's better to do it at the same time.

823
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Otherwise, it will be a big mess.

824
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
It's not good to call the outside force immediately.

825
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Okay.

826
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,160
Then start preparing now.

827
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
We'll set off after 12 o'clock.

828
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Yes.

829
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
Take care.

830
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
I'm leaving.

831
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Ruyi.

832
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
What's wrong?

833
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,160
You're leaving just like that?

834
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
You're going to the Ministry of Health.

835
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
I'm going to save His Majesty.

836
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
In the script,

837
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
it's considered to be a life or death.

838
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,160
But you just said I'm leaving.

839
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
And you really left.

840
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,160
But every time I went out,

841
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
it was always like this.

842
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
It was the past.

843
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Can you be the same as before?

844
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
I see.

845
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Then what do you want me to say to you?

846
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,160
If I say it,

847
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
what's the point?

848
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Why are you so awkward?

849
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Anyway, I'll be back safely.

850
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
You will definitely successfully save Wu Di.

851
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,160
Then we'll meet at the place we agreed on.

852
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
That's about right.

853
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
This is what I want to hear.

854
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
If I knew you were so easy to satisfy,

855
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
I would have said it earlier.

856
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
Then you just say it.

857
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
You have to say it earlier.

858
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,160
Then you go to the Ministry of Health.

859
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Only my mother will accompany you.

860
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,160
Don't worry.

861
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
We have our own arrangements.

862
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,160
Besides, I used to act alone.

863
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
You used to have the whole Department of Health as support.

864
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
But now you...

865
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Are you all ready?

866
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
I'm not ready yet.

867
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,160
What?

868
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Come with me to a place.

869
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Come with me.

870
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
Come with me.

871
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Come with me.

872
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
Come with me.
