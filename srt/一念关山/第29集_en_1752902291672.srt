1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My world shimmers like the sky

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't blame me for changing my mind

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I can't get what I want

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm afraid I can't forget what I lost

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm still here, I hope the day will come

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When the time comes, I'll be back

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How are you?

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Ruyi, I need you to...

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm more than you on the other side

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll go to Li Tengguang to discuss

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
From Yong'an Tower to the gate

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Find a way to get everyone out of here quickly and safely

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
OK

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 16

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You asked me what I wanted most

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Sir, please, please save my sister

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She was pulled out at the age of sixteen

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want to save her

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But she's in the name book

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't escape, I can't leave

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Senior, you've been in the stomach for so many years

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Is there nothing you want to do?

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've been living for thirty-five years

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's already a good fortune

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't want to think about anything else

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Meining, can you help me for a while?

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I need five hundred jin of big yellow

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
One hundred jin of white bamboo

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
One hundred jin of jujube

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You want so much medicine

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I remember

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I used this prescription for you before

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's the antidote for controlling white dogs and drugs

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The human heart

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Tiantai Eight-Year May

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Qi State's Pei Junming family

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's that

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is tying me up

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, tie up their names

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Only destroy their names

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They can really be free

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,480
Master.

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,960
Master.

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,040
I just received a message that you would come to me.

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,560
I thought I heard it wrong.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Zhao Qingjing.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
The dark young master of the Zhu Yi Division can't come in.

50
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,560
I heard that you own this land now.

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,560
Yes.

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm a hard worker.

53
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
I bought this land.

54
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,920
By the way, master.

55
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you have any instructions for coming here?

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,160
This is the withdrawal route of the Wu State Envoy's Regiment.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,800
You have three routes.

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
Help me to think about it.

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
See which route is more appropriate.

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
By then,

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,160
I need your Yulin Guards to cooperate.

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,400
Okay.

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,240
You can't go in.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
Why don't you let us in?

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,000
The county magistrate sent a message to your lord

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,440
according to our order to leave the country.

67
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,400
Lord is not here.

68
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,280
You can give the letter to me.

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,640
I saw him coming here just now.

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,600
Did I see it wrong?

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,520
He was here that day.

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,120
Did your master say that

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,040
as long as I want to come,

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
I can enter this horse farm at any time?

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,760
Our county magistrate will be the lady master

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,400
of your mansion soon.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,240
County magistrate.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
Please forgive me.

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,000
County magistrate.

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Go back.

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,600
Okay.

82
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,160
Choose this route.

83
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Keep this map.

84
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,720
By then,

85
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
the Six-striped Pagoda will notify you.

86
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,280
Okay.

87
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
But master.

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,840
This time,

89
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,040
will you take care of it with Ning Yuan?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It has nothing to do with you.

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,120
Can you not do it?

92
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
Last time,

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,560
you left me here.

94
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
Then you never came back.

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,720
Master.

96
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
Juer has grown up.

97
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,960
Can you wait for me for a few more years?

98
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,120
When I become the minister of the county magistrate,

99
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,800
I will take care of

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,000
everything in the world for you.

101
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
I believe

102
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,760
everything you said is good.

103
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,080
But

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,880
do you think

105
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,200
I will like

106
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,560
the best thing in the world?

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
But what Ning Yuan gave you,

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,280
you must like it.

109
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,600
Of course.

110
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
Because he is Ning Yuanzhou.

111
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,000
He is the person I like.

112
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,400
So Juer,

113
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,400
you are like this too.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,480
If you meet someone

115
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
you like in the future,

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
you will know

117
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
what is the best thing in the world.

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,920
That is your destiny.

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,440
But you are my life's wish.

120
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,000
If you are gone,

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
what is the meaning of my efforts?

122
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,280
I just like you and love you.

123
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,320
Am I wrong?

124
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,320
You love

125
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,320
the person you think

126
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,920
is the best.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,720
But

128
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,360
I am just a person.

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
If you cry again,

130
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,320
I will kill you.

131
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
Cry as much as you want.

132
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,680
Or I will kill you.

133
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,160
Master.

134
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,040
Go.

135
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,680
All right.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
Maybe you should go home now.

137
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,360
If you were me,

138
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,000
I would be again a crease on the ground

139
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,680
For i can't hear what I tell you.

140
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,240
And.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
you'll have many family members.

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
Why are you the only one who's left?

143
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,880
Have you cried enough?

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,400
Yes.

145
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,120
And I've thought it through.

146
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,840
It's okay if you don't harm me now.

147
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
I can wait.

148
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,560
I can wait forever.

149
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,000
After all, I'm younger than you.

150
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm more

151
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Who is he?

152
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Who is he?

153
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,400
Who is he?

154
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,880
Master.

155
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,800
Let's go.

156
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,920
Go to spicy food first.

157
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,080
Yes.

158
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,920
Show those requirement quits.

159
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,920
How's the matter?

160
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,520
Underage movie screen Gluttony.

161
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,280
Coming.

162
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm the daughter of the County Master of Jingming.

163
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Who are you?

164
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,280
He followed me and said that he was the daughter of the County Master of Jingming.

165
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
It seems that he saw me looking for you.

166
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,280
You handle your own affairs.

167
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Yes.

168
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Who is she?

169
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Who told you to come?

170
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
You don't need to care.

171
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
I'm your wife.

172
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Why can't I care?

173
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
If you want to achieve great things,

174
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
it's not enough to rely on the people who killed the West Department.

175
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
She is the one who killed the East Department.

176
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
You lie.

177
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
The girl who killed the East Department

178
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
can't have such a high martial arts.

179
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
She is from the Zhu Yi Wei.

180
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
She is Bai Que.

181
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
She is not.

182
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Anyway, if you don't want to be in trouble,

183
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
just pretend that you haven't seen anything today.

184
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Don't mention a word to your father.

185
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
I don't care.

186
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
But I just want to know what your relationship is.

187
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Do you like her?

188
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Like?

189
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Like the kind of love in the bones.

190
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,280
I'd rather die than love her.

191
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Are you satisfied?

192
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
If you like her,

193
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
why did you treat me so well two days ago?

194
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
I told you.

195
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
I'm willing to get along with you

196
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
because we have a partnership.

197
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
It's good for both of us to get along with each other.

198
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
If you like another man,

199
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
I won't mind.

200
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
In the future,

201
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
it's best to have a good relationship with him in person.

202
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Just be safe and sound in private.

203
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
I believe that

204
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
as long as we find the right way to get along,

205
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,280
we can also trust Rong Bin in the future.

206
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
I like this place very much.

207
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Can I come here often in the future?

208
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
If you like her,

209
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
you can come here anytime.

210
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
It turns out that I was wrong.

211
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
I should cooperate with you.

212
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
I should trust you.

213
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
That's what I meant.

214
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Go.

215
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Go.

216
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Go.

217
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
The superior has orders.

218
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Go to the temple.

219
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Go.

220
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Go.

221
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Go.

222
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Go.

223
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Go.

224
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Go.

225
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Go.

226
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Go out.

227
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Go.

228
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Go.

229
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Stop.

230
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
What are you doing here?

231
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Go.

232
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Go.

233
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Sir,

234
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I heard that

235
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
the scenery of our Yonghuan Lake is very good.

236
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
I came here to have a look.

237
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Go.

238
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Search the mountain.

239
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
It hurts.

240
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
It hurts.

241
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
It hurts.

242
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
You are not leaving today?

243
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Yes.

244
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
I'll come again in the afternoon.

245
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Goodbye.

246
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
It's a pity.

247
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Such a good scenery.

248
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
How can it be delicious?

249
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Go.

250
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,560
Go.

251
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,800
After him.

252
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,000
Step aside!

253
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
Go there.

254
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Let's go.

255
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Let's go.

256
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Ruo'er!

257
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Who are you?

258
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
What are you doing?

259
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
You are the first to be caught.

260
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Don't move.

261
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
It's not me.

262
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Let's go to the next room.

263
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Help me.

264
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Let's go.

265
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Who let you come in like this?

266
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Greetings, Miss Jinming.

267
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
The Imperial Guards are searching for the criminal.

268
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
It's you again.

269
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
What?

270
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I'm the criminal?

271
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Then am I a criminal

272
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
who goes out of the palace?

273
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Search.

274
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Search.

275
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Go find somewhere else.

278
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Yes.

279
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
You are really a criminal.

280
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
I'm still thinking of a reason.

281
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
What's good about it?

282
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
You've finished it for me.

283
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
By the way,

284
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
you said you were

285
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
the Jinming County Master

286
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
of the House of Duke of Chu.

287
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
What's your name?

288
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Chu Yue.

289
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
How do you know?

290
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
I'm the first to be caught.

291
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
You are the first to be caught.

292
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
You are the first to be caught.

293
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
You are the first to be caught.

294
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Do you know what kind of criminal I am?

295
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
A thief.

296
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
I know everything about

297
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,280
the family of the rich in the capital.

298
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I don't believe it.

299
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
What else do you know about me?

300
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Your name is Chu Yue.

301
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
When your mother gave birth to you,

302
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
she dreamed of the God of War

303
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
on the top of her head.

304
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
That's why she gave you this name.

305
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
You might think

306
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
you are really the God of War.

307
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
You are always

308
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
playing with your brother's sword

309
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
and dreaming of the glory of Sha Xi.

310
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Right?

311
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
I heard that

312
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
you are not a petty person.

313
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Today,

314
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
you are wearing a rouge.

315
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
You went to see the couple?

316
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
No.

317
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
It's just dark.

318
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
You came alone to the bar.

319
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Why didn't you light the candles?

320
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
The smell of the wine is so strong.

321
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
You drank a lot.

322
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
You took advantage of the wine

323
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
and got hurt by the couple.

324
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Who are you?

325
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
I didn't tell you just now.

326
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
A criminal.

327
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
A thief.

328
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
I don't believe it.

329
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
How can a thief

330
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
say that he is a thief?

331
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,280
The noble and noble

332
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Lady Jin Ming

333
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
helped me to get a position.

334
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
What's impossible

335
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
is impossible?

336
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
I...

337
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
I don't know why

338
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
I helped you so badly.

339
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
I had a fight with her today.

340
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I was in a bad mood.

341
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
I wanted to find a place to drink.

342
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
The lady boss just came in

343
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
and said that there was no A-class.

344
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
I don't want to

345
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
be with others.

346
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I want to say that

347
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I want to find a place to stay for a while.

348
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I just fell asleep while drinking.

349
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
And

350
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
I hate the doctor.

351
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
I mean

352
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
the A-class that has been booked

353
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
why is there

354
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
a little fairy?

355
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
You are interesting.

356
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's a good time to talk to you.

357
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
How about this?

358
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Drink with me a few more times.

359
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
How can I

360
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
bother the lady boss to come in person?

361
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Right?

362
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Yue'er.

363
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
It's getting late.

364
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
The wine smells good.

365
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
I have a few words

366
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,280
that you must listen to.

367
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
First,

368
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
when you are sad,

369
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
don't drink alone.

370
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
It's easy to get into trouble.

371
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Second,

372
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
don't drink with a stranger.

373
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
No matter how

374
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
handsome and gentle

375
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
the man is,

376
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
it's easier to get into trouble.

377
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Third,

378
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
next time when you have

379
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
a beautiful and kind

380
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
woman like me

381
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
to help you,

382
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
don't forget.

383
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
What if she doesn't recognize you?

384
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
What if she gets married?

385
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Third,

386
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
is that really going to happen?

387
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Okay.

388
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I'll leave the wine and the room to you.

389
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
I'll send someone

390
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
to the Palace of the State to burn the line.

391
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Let them

392
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
pick you up an hour later.

393
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
How about it?

394
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Goodbye.

395
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I can't bear to leave.

396
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
So,

397
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
for the sake of our meeting,

398
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
I'm begging you to help me

399
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
for the last time.

400
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Today,

401
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
it's a secret

402
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
that belongs to the two of us.

403
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I won't tell him.

404
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
You have to make a vow to Chu Yue.

405
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I'll believe you.

406
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
I'll make a vow.

407
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Hurry up.

408
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
You don't know martial arts.

409
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
The most important thing is to strike.

410
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
This is not bad.

411
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
Give it to me first.

412
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Ruyi,

413
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
you have two chances.

414
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
If you can't defeat me,

415
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
then you must be able to beat me.

416
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
I'll be the one who beats you.

417
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
I'll beat you.

418
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
I'll beat you.

419
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
I'll beat you.

420
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I'll beat you.

421
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Sister,

422
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
among the two of you,

423
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,280
am I better or Li Tongguang is better?

424
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
You're as smart as me.

425
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
And you're also

426
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
a jealous person.

427
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
It hurts.

428
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
I'm talking about you.

429
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
There's a person in the house who doesn't know you.

430
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Let go of me.

431
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
The more you live, the more you go back.

432
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm getting younger.

433
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Don't worry.

434
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
I know the little lady best.

435
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
I just need to look at her eyes.

436
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,280
I know she will never say it out.

437
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm telling you

438
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
to relax.

439
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
By the way,

440
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,280
I know the route here.

441
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
But the tower is really close.

442
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
From today on,

443
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
all the guests are not allowed to go up and down.

444
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
I'm worried.

445
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
If that's the case,

446
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
it's more troublesome.

447
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Don't worry.

448
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I'll take care of it.

449
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Okay.

450
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
I'll go to the bathroom.

451
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
I'll go with you.

452
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
I'll go with you.

453
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Okay.

454
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
I'll go with you.

455
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
I'll go with you.

456
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
I'll go with you.

457
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I'll go with you.

458
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I'll go with you.

459
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
I bought some of your favorite sweet things.

460
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,480
Peach blossom cake.

461
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
It's a nice name.

462
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,960
The workshop just heated it.

463
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,280
It should be heated to be delicious.

464
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,120
It's made of peach blossom honey and pear blossom honey.

465
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,320
It smells like flowers.

466
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,880
It smells good.

467
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,480
This taste is

468
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,480
average.

469
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,240
It's not funny.

470
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,760
Take it away.

471
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
You're in a good mood today.

472
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,640
What's wrong? What happened?

473
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
I want to know

474
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,760
how to deal with Zhu Yiwei.

475
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,880
How?

476
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,320
I'll destroy Zhu Yiwei's name list

477
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,040
and cure Bai Qun's illness.

478
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,880
That day, Deng Hui listened to you.

479
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,320
Under Andy's eyes,

480
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
he risked his life to let go of his own men.

481
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
I think

482
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,920
he's not as bad as Jialin said.

483
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,400
As long as he's willing to cooperate,

484
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,200
the name list of Zhu Yiwei

485
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
may be able to regain freedom.

486
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
My Ruyi

487
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,600
is really a man of spirit.

488
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,000
May the moon be clear.

489
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
Then I'll share my good luck with you.

490
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,920
Wish you

491
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,600
a successful career.

492
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:49,000
That means

493
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,120
good luck.

494
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,600
Go back.

495
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,100
I'll do what he asks of me.

496
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,400
Do you want me to play his impudence?

497
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,040
Hold on, hold on.

498
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:52,460
No one can Ukrainian

499
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,680
Sir, where are they?

500
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,620
There's someone here who will follow us.

501
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,280
Maybe soundproof????

502
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,440
Let's go, take them away together.

503
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,360
Yes.

504
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,560
No.

505
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,720
Be careful.

506
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,920
Stride forward to the corner of the bed its all yours.

507
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,920
5,003 yuan

508
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,720
Pretending to be beautiful but acting like one

509
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,420
Be careful

510
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,780
8,000 yuan

511
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,420
Tonight Naixia set up a banquet

512
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,620
I heard that his Yuchuan wine is very delicious.

513
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Let's go.

514
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Go!

515
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Let's go.

516
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
There are assassins!

517
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Be alert! There are assassins!

518
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
They're here.

519
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,420
They really came to save me.

520
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Let's go.

521
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
I'm just looking.

522
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Assassins! Come and help!

523
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Shoot!

524
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
Yes.

525
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Don't let them get away!

526
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Be careful!

527
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:51,400
Take him to the place where the

528
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
assassins are.

529
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Retreat!

530
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
Hurry!

531
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Stop!

532
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
The assassins are retreating.

533
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
Let's split up.

534
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
You're getting old.

535
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Find a place to rest.

536
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Sir, this way please.

537
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,420
Okay.

538
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Here.

539
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Here.

540
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
It smells so good.

541
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Forget it.

542
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,420
I'll treat you to a drink.

543
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Hurry!

544
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
This way!

545
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Sir, Wu Di is not dead.

546
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
The assassins have been all found.

547
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
They were shot in the arrow.

548
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
There's a poison in it.

549
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,420
But the Shi Teng has also checked it.

550
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
The people of the Sixth Route Hall

551
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
will accompany Prince Li to the Chengguo Prefecture to make a speech tonight.

552
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,420
This doesn't look like a person coming to save someone.

553
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Hurry!

554
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
It looks like a person coming to kill someone.

555
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,420
Look at the blood on the arrow.

556
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
It looks like it's from the army.

557
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
This way!

558
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Check it.

559
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
Yes.

560
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Sir, we've checked it.

561
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
The arrow is from the North Cang Army of Wu State.

562
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,420
It's not the Sixth Route Hall.

563
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
I knew it.

564
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
The Sixth Route Hall is not that stupid.

565
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Your Majesty,

566
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,420
can you remind me?

567
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Whose body is the North Cang Army

568
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
in the Gui State?

569
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
If you can't find it,

570
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
use the poison smoke.

571
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
It's really a good idea.

572
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
Yes.

573
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
You're really a close friend.

574
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Your Majesty,

575
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,420
were you happy just now

576
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,420
that someone came to save you?

577
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,420
It seems that

578
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
someone didn't want you to go back.

579
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
I want to check the number of casualties.

580
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,420
I want to report to His Majesty.

581
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,420
Your Majesty,

582
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
today is the first day of His Majesty's death.

583
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,420
I'm afraid that the palace is doing a magic ceremony.

584
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,420
It is late,

585
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
I won't let you go.

586
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Don't cry.

587
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,420
Miss Qi,

588
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
why are you so worried about me?

589
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
I want you to search for longer.

590
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
She's with a recibirIB guy.

591
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Don't worry, I won't look for anybody unwell who helped.

592
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Long Long,

593
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
have you noticed

594
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
someone in his house

595
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
who is taking dangerous steps?

596
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,420
I have to go now.

597
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
Perfect,

598
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
Miss Qi.

599
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Is that so?

600
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,180
Do you want to go back to jail?

601
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,220
Don't cry.

602
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,380
I wish I could cry.

603
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,400
10 days later

604
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,220
See?

605
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
Let's see.

606
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
Boss, this one is good.

607
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,220
Why are you always following me?

608
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
You're here to pick flowers again?

609
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
It's none of your business if I'm not picking flowers.

610
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
But if you keep following me, it's none of my business.

611
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,220
No, you... drink with me again.

612
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
I'll buy you a drink.

613
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,220
I don't care if you're a criminal or a talent thief.

614
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
I just want you to drink with me for a while.

615
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I'll really kill you.

616
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Even if you want to kill me, you have to get me drunk first.

617
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
No, I can't discuss it.

618
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
I'm begging you.

619
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
Pick flowers, make a good family.

620
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,220
I... I went home after hearing your words that day.

621
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,220
But I still feel uncomfortable when I get home.

622
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,220
I can't sleep these few nights.

623
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,220
I don't know why I came here tonight.

624
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,220
I just walked to the door and I saw you.

625
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
I'm begging you.

626
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,220
I really feel uncomfortable and want to drink.

627
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Just stay with me for a while.

628
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Let's go.

629
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
This way.

630
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,220
If I tell you like this, the wine in that house is actually quite good.

631
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,220
If you really want to get drunk, I'll take you to a good place.

632
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
You're so annoying.

633
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,220
I'm not annoying.

634
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
You're so annoying.

635
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
This is the good place you're talking about?

636
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,220
The golden palace in the sky, the golden sand building in the world,

637
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,220
and the moon.

638
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Not bad, right?

639
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,220
Today, I'll let you have fun.

640
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
Let's go. I'll take you down and take a tour.

641
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Upstairs is the elegant street, downstairs is the net.

642
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,220
It's so fresh.

643
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,220
The dancers in your country are not only good at dancing and dancing,

644
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
but also beautiful.

645
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,220
I'll take you to have fun today.

646
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,220
There is a gambling place over there.

647
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
Over there, over there.

648
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
There are many things that you can't see.

649
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,220
If the young lady sees it, she'll make a mistake.

650
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,220
You often come here?

651
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Of course.

652
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
But the best place in the world,

653
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,220
the best food, the best wine,

654
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
I'm like a rat.

655
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,220
The whole world has been hurt by a new woman.

656
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
It's not a big deal.

657
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
Why are you here?

658
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
I'm the owner of this place.

659
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
Why can't I be here?

660
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,220
Little girl, don't blame me for not reminding you.

661
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
This is not the place you should come to.

662
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
This person is not a good person.

663
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,220
He even lied to me.

664
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
He's a big silver thief.

665
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
I know. He said it.

666
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,220
He's a criminal and a thief.

667
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,220
Are you surprised?

668
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,220
Are you surprised?

669
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,220
Miss Yue'er likes me.

670
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220
One room, three talks.

671
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,220
Thank you.

672
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Miss Yue'er, please.

673
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,220
Please.

674
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Today, Commander Deng asked me to come here.

675
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
What's your opinion?

676
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,220
Why are you pretending to be stupid?

677
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
That day, outside the palace,

678
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,220
you were the one who saved the people we saved.

679
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,220
The headquarters have some people who came back from Wu State.

680
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,220
They said that when the officials were killed,

681
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,220
they would die with one person.

682
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,220
Isn't this the fire of Liudao Hall?

683
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Moreover,

684
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,220
the height of Lord Ning and his style

685
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,220
are too easy to identify.

686
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,220
So it's here.

687
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,220
The Guiwei and Liudao Hall are enemies.

688
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Why do you help me?

689
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
I'm the leader of Liudao Hall.

690
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,220
You're the commander of the Guiwei.

691
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,220
I understand how you don't want your men to die.

692
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,220
Since you're helping me,

693
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,220
I owe you a favor.

694
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
Yongan was attacked today.

695
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,220
The assassin failed, but he was injured.

696
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,220
One day, His Majesty will transfer Wu Di to another place.

697
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,220
I'll report to His Majesty.

698
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
The Guiwei is killed by the people.

699
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,220
They can't keep watch.

700
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,220
Please send other imperial guards to watch Wu Di.

701
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,220
I believe that there's no one to watch.

702
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,220
If Lord Ning does something again,

703
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,220
it should be much easier.

704
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,220
Is this a favor?

705
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,220
Thank you.

706
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,220
In this way,

707
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,220
Lord Ning has admitted the assassin today.

708
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,220
It's related to Liudao Hall.

709
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,220
I'm sorry.

710
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,220
If Lord Deng says no,

711
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,220
it means no.

712
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
If Lord Deng says yes,

713
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
it means yes.

714
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,220
Good.

715
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,220
I have another thing to tell you.

716
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,220
Is it true that the North Plains people secretly entered the Pass?

717
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,220
This is indeed true.

718
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,220
In this way,

719
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,220
we'll have a chance to fight against the North Plains people with Lord Ning.

720
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,220
We have to drink to this.

721
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,220
Please.

722
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,220
Cheers.

723
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
But before that,

724
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,220
we're still enemies.

725
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,220
I thought

726
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,220
what he said was like a friend

727
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,220
and like a couple,

728
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,220
loving and harmonious.

729
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,220
Who knows what he meant was

730
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,220
just two people fighting.

731
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,220
He already has someone else in his heart.

732
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,220
I'm just sad.

733
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,220
But I...

734
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,220
But I can't move my hand.

735
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,220
You can't open your mouth.

736
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,220
You just like him a little bit.

737
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,220
And you're a little bit unwilling.

738
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,220
Maybe I don't like him that much.

739
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,220
I know.

740
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,220
I've hurt a lot of little girls' hearts.

741
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,220
I know.

742
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,220
Why are men so bad?

743
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,220
Why do they like him so much?

744
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,220
Why do they treat me so well?

745
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
Why do they make me misunderstand?

746
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
Don't be sad.

747
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,220
It's like this.

748
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,220
It's because you're beautiful and good.

749
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,220
Even if he doesn't like you that much,

750
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,220
you must have a different light in you.

751
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,220
You can't help him to be nice to you again and again.

752
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,220
You're lying.

753
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,220
If I lie to you,

754
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,220
no other girl in the world will like me.

755
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,220
