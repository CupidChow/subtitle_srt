Episode 2

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No matter who it is, we should check every single person in the clinic

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Especially women

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Sun Long

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Lao Qian

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I told you to check carefully

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's wrong?

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't walk on the road when you see Yang Yong

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No flying sheep

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Only this little sheep

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Do you want it?

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It seems to be a sheep

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sun Long, take him to the sheep's den

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Master

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm late

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm late

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Please forgive me

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Not late at all

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You came just in time

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Liuli who followed me before

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I saw her too

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
After saying goodbye to master

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I followed your order

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've been keeping an eye on Zhu Yiwei's movements for you

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yesterday, I came to the road of He County

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I received a message from a flying pigeon in Jinbao station 200 miles away from here

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The shop owner said

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Seeing a woman wearing the old-fashioned earring of Zhu Yiwei

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I kept the letter

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Later, Wei Zhong recognized her

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She is Liuli who followed you before

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
After Liuli's fake death

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She was expelled from Wei Zhong

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I felt that she suddenly appeared

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not a coincidence

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This changed the schedule temporarily

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I rushed over to see her

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Linglong

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Liuli

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Unexpectedly, she just talked to me

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And started to ask me

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Master, are you still in the mortal world?

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I pretended to be shocked and talked to her

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Soon she said

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She is now following Li Tongguang

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And Li Tongguang asked her to come over to confirm if I was human

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Just as you expected

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then how did you tell her?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I just stood in her shoes

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I analyzed it for her

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
After Liuli left Zhu Yiwei

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She had a bad time

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It was Marquis Changqiu who took her in

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And took her as a close servant

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I just said

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Marquis Changqiu treated her well

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's just because

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She and your relationship is not good

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But if you are still in the mortal world

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She will retreat

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
With Liuli's temper

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm afraid I can hear your confession

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No wonder

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
In the army camp of Anguo

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She obviously saw me

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But she wasn't so shocked

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think in front of Li Tongguang

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She will say

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I just look like a human

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thanks for your secret

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are welcome

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm flattered

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm so happy

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But there is one thing

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I didn't think clearly

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
With your connection to the news

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why don't you know

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Marquis Changqiu is an old friend

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But why did you say something wrong

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When you mentioned him

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm guilty

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't like to hear wrong

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to hear the reason

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Marquis has seen you several times

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Didn't you notice

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Does he have any intention on you

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Not the kind of apprentice to the master

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But the kind of man to women

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Marquis almost went crazy after you left

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, he's crazy

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Master

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Marquis thought

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You really were in the fire in the prison

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In the fire

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just risk your life to resist the order to buy the guard

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Every night, you go into the ruins

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have to dig it little by little

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Fortunately, I was able to help you escape

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I was in the fire

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I made some bones in the soil

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How could you stop

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The court said

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You are the one who killed the late queen

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You are not allowed to enter the funeral

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Marquis

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He buried your fake bones in a secret cave

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
After that, every 15th of every month

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
As long as he is in An Du

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will go to worship before the day of the death

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Never cut

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I thought before

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is just a form of respect

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But later I entered the Golden Sand Gang

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I took the business of the second prince to investigate Marquis Chang Qing

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is when I found out

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He softened the painting of the jade painting you saw

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I hid your portrait in the mansion

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The clothes you wore before

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He also found it all

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Used to worship the Lord

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And all these years, no matter who says

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He refused

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You think too much

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He is responsible for the gathering of relatives

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Most likely because of the reason of the first princess

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Lord, you and I have done nothing

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This simple man's mind

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, no need to say

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So you saw it

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I and Ning Yuan Zhou are close

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I deliberately avoided mentioning Li Tong Guang

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Thank you

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But as a human heart, I have disappeared

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Just like you who call me sister now

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not Lin Lang anymore

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Zhu Yi Wei taught us a lot

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Also hurt us a lot

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We can't forget the past

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But it will never go back to the past

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
After I finish my work

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I also want to do something meaningful like you

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If I can help the past Zhu Yi Wei's Wei Zhou

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's better

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sometimes I also feel very confused

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was going to find Zhu Yi Wei to avenge

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But I still want to help him

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Lord, you are merciful

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know what you want to do

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I also want to participate in the second

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The reason why women become white birds

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Except for the heart of parents

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mostly because of the freedom of religion

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Simple mind, hard to protect

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Easy to be tempted

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I want to teach those

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
White birds who have become Zhu Yi Wei's wives

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Teach them the way to live

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This idea is good

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Can you reserve first

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
To teach the lesson of the plan

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I will

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Honored

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then Lord Ning

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Can you teach them

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We come with the same heart

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But whether it can continue to be together in the future

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Uncertain

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is not bad

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Anyway, Lord Ning is beautiful

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why don't you know

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I also know a lot of people

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Very good looking

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know a lot of handsome men

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Very good-looking men

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Young and handsome

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There are both mature and steady

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't let him hear this

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Otherwise, I have to demolish your golden sand building

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
General Yuan's matter

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Please write a letter to the governor of Lingzhou

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait for us to return to the capital together

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They can also be considered as making a contribution

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Ok, I'll go now

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No one told me that the young girl came

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's time to eat

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll go find Lao Qian

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Nothing, old trouble

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't tell everyone

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't mess up my morale

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The girl is not here to find you

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is here to find Ruyi

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But you can't let them stay together for too long

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't believe it

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
In the girl's mind

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Now it's all strange things

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You want her to bring back beauty

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You two in this life

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You talk about

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Where did I get weird

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Tao

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Marquis Changxin is here

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I just didn't say I wanted to see Ruyi

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Your Highness, Governor

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And you

219
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't want to talk nonsense

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Your princess suggested before

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
As long as I am willing to help everyone to bring back your emperor

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are willing to send me to Yun

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Two cities free

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Exactly

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
it is good

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I promise you

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And can guarantee

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let you make a great contribution in a month

229
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll tell you directly

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Your conditions

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Give it to me

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll let you think about it

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How dare you

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The princess is my sister

235
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Now you are begging me

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll give you a night's time to think

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tomorrow at four

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You either send her over

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Or

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Be ready to collect the body for Yang Xingyuan

241
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Stop

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How can you be so easy to get into the princess

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Lord Ning

244
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Interesting

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Interesting

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You want me with a clear conscience

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But you dare not even look at me

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Turn around

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Look at my eyes

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tell me

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What do you want me to do

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Do you want to punish me to do hard work

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
To take the humiliation of today

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or let me be the foundation for you to see

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
To help you do things every day

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How can it be

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I will be good to you

260
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What a good method

261
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Is it to invite palace painters to draw hundreds of small portraits

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Full of your secret room

263
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Or put the purple clothes in the morning

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Pearl clothes, flying clothes

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All on me

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Be a active doll

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How do you know

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You guys are all in the Wudu branch

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
All in the hands of Liudatang

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you think we don't know

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Li Tongguang, Li Jiu

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You took me away

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's just to make me the substitute for that person

274
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Like now

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You are as usual

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So ridiculous

277
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So ridiculous

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't say that

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Master

280
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I say it again

281
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I am not your master

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I am the Princess of Wuyang

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You think the biggest secret

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's just a layer of paper

285
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
After you took me away

286
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Who can you hide from

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Two princes of Anguo

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Know how happy you are to hide the Princess of Di state in the house

289
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So many doubts about the king of Anguo

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I've been cold to you for so long

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I just promoted you

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You want everything back to the original point

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And your smart county master

294
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You say

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If he suddenly knows

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I have a princess sister of the Wuguo

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Must be very happy

298
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You don't care about the head and tail

299
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Isn't it stupid

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You worked hard to climb to the current position

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
For what, have you forgotten

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You thought about it

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Once lost the king's confidant

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You have to go back to the days when people laugh at you

305
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The days when people look down on you

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You thought about it

307
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Your master has a soul

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Know you still hold on to him

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The thoughts of people who can't see

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
How disgusting it should be

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I didn't

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I didn't

313
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I didn't

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I didn't

315
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I didn't

316
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Really

317
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I didn't

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Solved

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Learn from this

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
A person's arrogant and extreme requirements

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Often his biggest weakness

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Ruyi

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ruyi

324
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What's wrong

325
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What did I say wrong again

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why are you looking at me like this

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yanzhou

329
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What's wrong with you

330
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Just in there

331
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They can't hear what you said

332
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But I heard

333
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I know you must be very sad

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You see the disciple you taught

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Become completely unfamiliar to you

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But you for us

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Have to untie your scar

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This is nothing

339
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I know you are strong

340
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm sorry about what happened before

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't need your sympathy

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But I need you

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You Yanzhou

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Don't do this

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can't solve our problems like this

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I know

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But as long as you are by my side

348
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
As long as you need me

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I will be there

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry

352
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm sorry

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sorry

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sorry

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm sorry

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm sorry

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm sorry

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry

363
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm sorry

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Absolutely sorry

368
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Year

369
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
My Lord

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
My Lord

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What's wrong with you

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
General Wu is still waiting in the military camp

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's up to you

374
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's get in the car

375
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,860
One, two, open your eyes,

376
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,220
and understand the power of dark moon and moon.

377
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,580
If you do not take a mouthsick groom from me,

378
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,160
who do you think I am?

379
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,820
Oh...

380
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,640
a motherub temperature seems to be wrong

381
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,020
I am the wrong one.

382
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,780
and I'm the right one.

383
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,440
But there's one thing that you should remember.

384
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,100
It's You�s.

385
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,140
Do you know what it is?

386
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,660
Is it important to think about it?

387
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,520
Are you having no Perfect considered?

388
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,940
Nonsense

389
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,760
You are only interested in master

390
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
There's an assassin

391
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,040
Restarting right away

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,360
Their formation is no match to that of Zhuyi聴

393
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
They're so vulnerable

394
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
Zhuyi聴? Just batt half the time

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,620
This opportunity allows us to resıldothat life.

396
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
You are already dead?

397
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,700
Built this as a Façade.

398
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,520
Kick F stays alive.

399
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,220
Grandfather!

400
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Why are there so many people?

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Go!

402
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Kill the enemy!

403
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes!

404
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Go!

405
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The enemy is here.

406
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Is there anything wrong with Marquis Changqing?

407
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The key to the military of the An State.

408
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The distance is about three miles.

409
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The line of the river and the military camp are ten miles away.

410
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's the light of the city.

411
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I know his martial arts.

412
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not much lower than the previous move.

413
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If it's a bandit,

414
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
it won't be necessary for him to send the enemy to ask for help.

415
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay.

416
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let's get ready and go save him.

417
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Save him?

418
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He needs us to save Man Tou.

419
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The An people can also see the enemy.

420
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The An people are a little farther away from us.

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And if it's a master,

422
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
it's no use to go to the ordinary soldiers.

423
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If we don't save him,

424
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
once he's in trouble,

425
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
it will definitely affect the peace talks.

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But if we save his life,

427
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Li Tung Guang will owe us a great favor.

428
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Is there any problem?

429
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
No.

430
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Shisan, Sun Lang,

431
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
take a few people with me.

432
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes.

433
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yuan Lu, Tian Zhao,

434
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you stay in the clinic to protect His Highness.

435
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes.

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Take care of His Highness for me.

437
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Rui Jian,

439
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the grenade.

440
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Thank you.

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let's go.

442
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Thank you.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Go.

444
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Go.

445
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Go.

446
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Go.

447
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Go.

448
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Listen to my order.

449
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's go.

450
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes.

451
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The sound system is right in front of us.

452
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You can't reveal your identity.

453
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We can go.

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't worry.

455
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I won't let anything happen to him.

456
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then be careful.

457
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Go.

458
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yong Lin.

459
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Go.

460
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Leave me alone.

461
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Go.

462
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Go.

463
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Go.

464
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Go.

465
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Ruan Lin.

466
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Sun Lang,

467
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
we need to be careful.

468
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Aim at the head and attack at the key point.

469
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Go!

470
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes!

471
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,500
Go!

472
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Hurry and hide!

473
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Go!

474
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,500
Old Ning!

475
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,000
Old Ning!

476
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Fireball, Yuan Lu gave it to you.

477
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Go to the north and rob the car!

478
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
If you kill him, you will forget!

479
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Hurry and help him!

480
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,000
No, your body...

481
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm fine, just a normal injury.

482
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Hurry and go!

483
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Hurry and go!

484
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,500
Hurry!

485
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,000
Hurry!

486
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Fireball!

487
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yuan Lu gave it to me, I'm done.

488
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What? Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

489
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,500
Be careful!

490
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Continue to attack!

491
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The leader is over there!

492
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Go and get him yourself!

493
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,500
No!

494
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Stop him!

495
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,500
Go!

496
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,500
Go!

497
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,500
Go!

498
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Ren Zhe!

499
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Li Niu!

500
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,500
Stop!

501
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,000
Don't run!

502
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,500
Don't run!

503
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,000
Don't run!

504
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,500
Stop!

505
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,000
Stop!

506
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,500
Don't run!

507
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,000
Don't run!

508
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,500
Don't run!

509
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,000
Old Ning!

510
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,500
Don't run!

511
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,000
Don't run!

512
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Ren Zhe!

513
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,280
living like a suppliers.

514
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,080
But those emerged to stand up

515
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,840
just simply look as building.

516
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,480
According to people,

517
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,260
يل xrefitch

518
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,600
They are generally

519
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,360
living rich

520
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,640
to pay for goods.

521
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,000
While

522
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,520
their mother

523
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,720
legs of a big market

524
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,240
whose іs

525
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,620
shei yu

526
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
Stealth bomb

527
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,320
Guanyin

528
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,920
Who killed them?

529
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,120
I killed all of you

530
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
I'll kill you all!

531
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
It's her.

532
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Stop playing!

533
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Go! Go!

534
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Don't chase her.

535
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
Nian Tao!

536
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Tao Er! Nian Tao!

537
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Wen Ni!

538
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Yuan Zhou!

539
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Come.

540
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
What's the relationship between you and Nian Yuan Zhou?

541
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
It's none of your business.

542
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
I don't care what the relationship is.

543
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Nian Yuan Zhou vomited so much blood.

544
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
She must be dead.

545
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Ou Yan!

546
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,120
She can only belong to me.

547
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
No one can take her away.

548
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
She's not the only one in this world.

549
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
How is she doing?

550
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
I have no idea.

551
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
She's poisoned.

552
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
I just don't know what kind of poison it is.

553
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
The Elixir of the Heavens.

554
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
She's been poisoned with the Elixir of the Heavens.

555
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
It's the secret medicine of the previous dynasty.

556
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
How could she take it?

557
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,120
In order to contain her, Zhang Song forced her to take it.

558
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Every ten days, she had to take the antidote from her.

559
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Zheng Qing Yun and Li Tong Guang were late to leave.

560
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
The antidote for this episode should have been taken by the Princess of Angu.

561
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
A series of pre-emptions started.

562
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
She has a pain of the spine.

563
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
The court couldn't stand it.

564
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
How could she hide it for so long?

565
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Let's not talk about this.

566
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
What's the way to detoxify her?

567
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
A series of pre-emptions.

568
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
We need a special antidote to detoxify her.

569
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
I have no way.

570
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Impossible.

571
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Didn't she just come back from the mountain of the lost?

572
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
There must be a way to save her.

573
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
It's useless.

574
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,120
I wanted to take a shot to detoxify her by releasing the blood.

575
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
But she's badly injured now.

576
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
She can't lose her blood.

577
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
Brother Qian, think again.

578
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
There must be another way.

579
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
Think again.

580
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Yes, Qian.

581
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
We need to think of another way.

582
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,120
If you can't release the blood, you can change it.

583
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
You can change my blood to Ning Tong.

584
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
My blood is enough for you to take mine.

585
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
I have blood.

586
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
How can you change it?

587
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Can you open her pulse?

588
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Who can save more?

589
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
How much time do I have left?

590
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
At most half an hour.

591
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Fortunately, she fell asleep.

592
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
She won't feel the pain.

593
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
Let me go pick up A-Yin.

594
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
At least let her see him one last time.

595
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Brother Qian,

596
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
do you have any antidote to detoxify her?

597
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
I'll go and ask her.

598
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
I'll go and ask her.

599
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
I'll go and ask her.

600
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I'll go and ask her.

601
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Do you have any antidote to detoxify her?

602
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
I'll go and ask her.

603
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
If you can't find it,

604
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
even if you find it,

605
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
it's too late.

606
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
The antidote to detoxify her?

607
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
What are you doing?

608
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Sister Ru Yi.

609
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
There's a poison in her blood.

610
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Even the blood phoenix of your six sects can be detoxified.

611
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
My lord.

612
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
You must cure her.

613
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
Yes.

614
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
There's no one left.

615
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
We surrounded a few people,

616
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
but they all died.

617
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
I'll leave first.

618
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Wait.

619
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Do you have any antidote to detoxify her?

620
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
No.

621
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
I'll leave first.

622
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
No.

623
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
I'll leave first.

624
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
No.

625
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I'll leave first.

626
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
No.

627
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
I'll leave first.

628
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
No.

629
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
No.

630
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
No.

631
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Do you have any medicine to detoxify her?

632
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Send them to her.

633
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Only the antidote to detoxify her.

634
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
You may leave.

635
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
Yes.

636
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
My lord, why...

637
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
I wanted you to stay away from death,

638
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
but I was afraid that in case something happened to her,

639
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Princess Hu Yang would hate me.

640
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
This is a gift from Duke Chu.

641
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
It's a golden egg.

642
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
Liu Li and I took this

643
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
and returned it to her.

644
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
How is it?

645
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Ning, it hurts.

646
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
Yuan Cheng.

647
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Yuan Cheng.

648
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Ning.

649
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
Ning.

650
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
Tao.

651
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Yuan Cheng.

652
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
My lord.

653
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Yes.

654
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
You're in my position.

655
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,120
The emperor of the country,

656
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Chuan Lu, has returned.

657
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
The people there are all dead.

658
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
They are all dead.

659
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
They are all dead.

660
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
They are all dead.

661
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
They are all dead.

662
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
They are all dead.

663
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
They are all dead.

664
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
The brothers over there

665
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
are Zhang Song's men.

666
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
We...

667
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
We have to let them

668
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
know what's going on here.

669
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Do you understand?

670
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
I understand.

671
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Don't talk.

672
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Save your energy.

673
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
Do you hear me?

674
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Tao.

675
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
Take a rest.

676
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
Don't talk nonsense.

677
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Luo Yi.

678
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I'm here.

679
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm here.

680
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Let's not talk about this.

681
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Keep drinking my blood.

682
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
There's a poison in it.

683
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
No.

684
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
It's useless.

685
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
It's my own life.

686
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
I know it.

687
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
I don't care.

688
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,120
You have to get better.

689
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Do you hear me?

690
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm sorry.

691
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
I was careless.

692
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
You have to get better

693
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
if you know you're sorry.

694
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
Do you hear me?

695
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
I'm sorry.

696
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
I...

697
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
I was too stupid.

698
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
I wanted to

699
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
explain to you

700
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,120
those useless things.

701
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,120
I won't let you die.

702
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Don't scare me.

703
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,120
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm sorry.

705
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Take this.

706
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
When you're unhappy,

707
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,120
remember to pick a big piece of paper.

708
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
I'll take it.

709
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
I'll take it.

710
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
I'll take it.

711
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
I'll take it.

712
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
I'll take it.

713
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I'll take it.

714
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I'll take it.

715
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
I'll take it.

716
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
I'll take it.

717
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
I'll take it.

718
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
I'll take it.

719
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
Alright.

720
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
If you die,

721
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
I'll tell the other people about you.

722
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Nhu Tung, wake up!

723
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,840
Let's go.

724
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
Yuanzhang.

725
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,240
Let's go.

726
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Yuanzhang.

727
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,480
I have the medicine for the western department.

728
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Wait.

729
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,320
We need to test it first.

730
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,280
If it's poisonous, I'll die with him.

731
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
You're not that cold-hearted.

732
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
Why are you so harsh?

733
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Go back and check those black people.

734
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
They're definitely not from the five countries.

735
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,120
The pulse is stable.

736
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Let's take him back.

737
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,520
Man Tian, come.

738
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Help me up.

739
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
Let's go.

740
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Will Yuanzhou wake up?

741
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
He will.

742
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
If he doesn't wake up,

743
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
I'll kill him.

744
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
How is it? Does it look like him?

745
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Wake up quickly.

746
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,320
I'm not as good as you in the world.

747
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,720
I'll make it up to you before I die.

748
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Waiting, waiting for you.

749
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,720
A long night of long nights.

750
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Waiting, waiting for you.

751
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,720
A long road ahead of us.

752
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
A long road ahead of us.

753
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,720
The road ahead of us is a dream.

754
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,800
Brother Zhou.

755
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,120
Brother Qian.

756
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,800
Brother Qian.

757
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,440
I'm fine now.

758
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,520
Great.

759
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,080
Okay.

760
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,920
Good night.

761
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,400
Ms Ru Yi.

762
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Please give me a new life

763
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,520
Please give me a new life

764
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:30,520
If the sky is clear, we will look back in our next life

765
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Please give me a new life

766
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,520
