00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Welcome to a new episode of Emancipation Gods!

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm not sure about this one...

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,400
Tah Еслиök

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,120
I'm sorry man

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,380
The

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
the

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,380
the

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,380
the

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,380
the

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,380
the

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,380
the

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,380
the

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,380
the

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:09,640
the

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,640
the

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
the

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
the

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,640
the

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,000
the

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,360
Lu Ding hands and heroin

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Who can piece?

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:53,280
The legal

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Agile

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,440
ığımız se portrait de

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,000
do

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
hey

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,580
do

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
When you killed Lou Qingqiang yesterday,

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
why did you say he was the first one?

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
The one who killed Linglong in the branch,

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
he was the first one.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Linglong?

33
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
That... your white-blooded sister?

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
But you shouldn't have done it at that time.

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
No one knows better than me

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
when to do it.

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
You can't even do a good job with white blood?

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
I'm the best killer.

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Except for assassinating,

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm not good at anything else.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Then how can the best killer

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
do such a stupid thing

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
like going back and forth and easily exposed his martial arts?

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Because Yuan Lu reminded me

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
that you killed Zhao Ji,

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
and he was the second one.

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I don't like to owe others in my life.

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I see.

49
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Then we're even.

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Now you're the owner of the Six Halls again.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Why did you let me go?

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Because this decision was made before I became the owner.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
And before, you were so shameless

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
that you went all out.

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I'll take it as a good luck.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
But you should be lucky that

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
your characteristics

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
are not the same as all the enemies

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
of the Six Halls in Siluo Hall.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Otherwise, I'm not that easy to kill.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
You're so soft-hearted.

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
No wonder you were betrayed by Zhao Ji.

63
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
We're the same.

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
You're the best killer.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
But you're willing to start from the beginning.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
And you killed the owner of the Six Halls

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
for a white bird.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
You're not smart enough to do that.

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
You're Zhu Yiwei's traitor?

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
No, I'm not.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm just a dead man.

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Okay.

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,200
I hope we can split up and meet again.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Then, can I stay?

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Aren't you going to save Wu Di?

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
In a few days, my inner power

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
will slowly recover.

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Take me on the road. I can do a lot for you.

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I know a lot about the case

80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
in the palace and the court.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
You want to get into the stone altar

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
and avoid Mr. Yue's pursuit?

83
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I just want to know who Mr. Yue is.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
This person

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
betrayed the entire Zhu Yiwei's Wudu branch.

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I know who Mr. Yue is.

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Only Zhao Ji and his party members.

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
But they're all dead.

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
But Yuan Lu and our An Shao

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
have found out

91
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
that Mr. Yue is about three inches taller than you.

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
When he appears, he wears a mask

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
and his skin is shaggy.

94
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
He came to Wudu three years ago

95
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
to calculate the situation based on martial arts.

96
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
At least it's a purple stone.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Can you help me investigate one more thing?

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
I have an important old friend

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
who was suddenly murdered a few years ago.

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
But before he left,

101
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
he wouldn't tell me who the murderer was.

102
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
I want to avenge him.

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
You're so smart.

104
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
You have such a powerful hell and Senluo Hall.

105
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Can you...

106
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I told you all this

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
to make you owe me a favor.

109
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
So I can keep the secret of the delegation.

110
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
As for you...

111
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Our delegation doesn't need assassins.

112
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
And you have too many secrets.

113
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
My mission is too heavy.

114
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
The best way for us to get along

115
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
is to walk side by side in the open.

116
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
By the way,

118
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Mr. Yue is the third one.

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
It's none of your business.

120
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
You're so smart.

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Of course I'm smart.

122
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Why are you all so fat?

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
It's been a long time.

124
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Why don't you ask for it?

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
In the right range,

126
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
you can make some money

127
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
for your own clothes.

128
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Why?

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
It's much better.

130
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Are you ready?

131
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,080
The

132
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
It's quite energetic.

133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Hall Leader.

134
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Get up.

135
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
What's wrong?

136
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Niang Tao.

137
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I'm sorry for the other brothers of the Heavenly Dao.

138
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
If I wasn't the one who blocked the Emperor's way,

139
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I would be fine.

140
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
They wouldn't be left on the riverbank

141
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
and die in the other country

142
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
with the name of a traitor.

143
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
As long as we don't let the people

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
of the Six Halls go to the valley,

145
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
we'll die the same way.

146
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
This operation is for the people

147
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
and for them.

148
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
We must prove that the Heavenly Dao is wise.

149
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
You and the two of them will be the leader of the party.

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
You can support us at any time.

151
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes.

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Bring the wine.

153
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
The first name is Heaven and Earth.

154
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
You two, together.

155
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
The third name is the future.

156
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Do it.

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Go.

158
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Go.

159
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Go.

160
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Go.

161
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Go.

162
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
The Emperor's wife is very cold.

163
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
But when he avenged his partner,

164
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
he was very determined.

165
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
He was probably a wife in a chess game.

166
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
That's why he had such a complicated relationship.

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Relationship?

168
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
What's so complicated about a relationship?

169
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Qian Zhao, where is Andy now?

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
After Andy took the third city of Xucai Jing,

171
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
the army reached the limit.

172
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
After Gu sent people to guard,

173
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
he led the army to return to the court.

174
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
He should have already reached Gui De Yuan.

175
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
The Emperor is also in the army.

176
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Okay.

177
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Sit.

178
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
I welcome you, Father.

179
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,200
May you return to the world and be victorious.

180
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Okay.

181
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Go.

182
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Soldiers, thank you for your hard work.

183
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Drink.

184
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

185
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Your Majesty.

186
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
This wine

187
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
is very good for your appetite.

188
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
It's bitter and bitter.

189
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
It's hard to swallow.

190
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Your country's banquet is full of confusion.

191
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
It's not good manners.

192
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
The war has already been over. People are no longer being punished.

193
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
So what if it's not good manners?

194
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Maybe the Emperor

195
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
will have to sit in our country for several decades.

196
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
It's better to get used to it earlier.

197
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Your Majesty,

198
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
the copper mine is already so big.

199
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
It seems

200
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I have to find a

201
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
noble girl for her earlier.

202
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Just giving away your marriage is not enough, right?

203
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
This time, I can be born without a place.

204
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
The little duke is a hand-made work.

205
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Your Majesty, except for the beauty,

206
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I only have one.

207
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm afraid that

208
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
you have to give me

209
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
a position as the Duke.

210
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Ah Jiu.

211
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
It's not easy to be a copper mine.

212
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
After all, you have half the blood of a nobody.

213
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Don't joke, brother.

214
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Copper mine is the only blood

215
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
of the Qinglin family.

216
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Father gave me a jade seal

217
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
and a precious treasure.

218
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
How can I have a blood of a nobody?

219
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm asking you all here.

220
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Who doesn't know that

221
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
his biological father

222
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
is a humble nobody?

223
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Brother,

224
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
you're drunk.

225
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Prince He Dong is really a crazy person.

226
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
He believes in all the wild words of the countryside.

227
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Brother,

228
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
drink.

229
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
All the soldiers, raise your cups.

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
You've worked hard.

231
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Drink.

232
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

233
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Every time I feel bad,

234
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I feel ashamed of myself.

235
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
What did

236
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
your master

237
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
teach you?

238
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Old man fell asleep?

239
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
He fell asleep.

240
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Otherwise how could I come?

241
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
You get up quickly.

242
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
There's too much ice in the water.

243
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Compared to my princess's

244
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
mother and those

245
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
who mocked me,

246
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
the water is warmer.

247
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
It's been months since we last met.

248
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Do you miss me?

249
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Do you miss me?

250
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Of course I miss you.

251
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Otherwise, I would miss

252
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
that old man.

253
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
That old man,

254
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
he married me for the sake of our Sha Xi tribe.

255
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I've been stupid for three years.

256
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
I've been awake for a long time.

257
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
You're hiding from me, aren't you?

258
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
If you don't want to see me,

259
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I'll leave. You're thinking too much.

260
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I just want to take this phoenix hairpin.

261
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
I found this when I was

262
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
in love with the emperor.

263
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
It's an antique from the past.

264
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
My mother loved me.

265
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
She always carried it with her as a souvenir.

266
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I hid it secretly

267
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
just for today.

268
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I'm willing to use this

269
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
to make a phoenix for Her Highness.

270
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Thank you.

271
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Thank you. I like it.

272
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
But you know

273
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
she won't let me be the empress.

274
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
In the harem,

275
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
there are no ladies.

276
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
She's just to balance the power.

277
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
That's why she always says

278
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
she misses my cousin

279
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Zhao Jie, the empress.

280
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
She's married and has a deep love for him.

281
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
The empress dowager

282
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
is also the head of the harem.

283
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
And she has more power

284
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
than the empress.

285
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You don't like the old man's killing.

286
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Then we should cooperate.

287
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
If I can get rid of the two princes,

288
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
I'll make your will

289
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
to fight come true.

290
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
You hate it.

291
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
It's not easy to fight.

292
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
If you become the head of the harem,

293
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Da'an will be far away from the war.

294
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
The enemy is everywhere.

295
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
I'm not alone.

296
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm the only one.

297
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Good night, my lord.

298
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Please rise.

299
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Brother Yuan Zhuang.

300
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Brother Yuan Zhuang.

301
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Your highness.

302
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Watch your head.

303
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Brother Yuan Zhuang.

304
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Your highness.

305
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Why are you back so soon?

306
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Why are you here all of a sudden?

307
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
You're the one who's been waiting for me.

308
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Why are you here all of a sudden?

309
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Who are you?

310
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I'm Ning Yuan Zhou, the chief of the six halls.

311
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Greetings, your highness.

312
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Brother Yuan Zhuang, please rise.

313
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Please rise.

314
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm here to protect you

315
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
from the secret order of Prime Minister.

316
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I'll protect you from all the troubles.

317
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I'm the only one who knows

318
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
the secret order of Prime Minister.

319
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Yes, your highness.

320
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Greetings, your highness.

321
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Brother Yuan Zhuang.

322
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm really scared.

323
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Chief of the six halls told me every day

324
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
that after we arrive in the country of An,

325
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
we might meet assassins.

326
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Will I die?

327
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Your highness should call yourself an orphan.

328
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Besides, you shouldn't call yourself that, your highness.

329
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Don't worry. We're here, aren't we?

330
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
This is Sun Lang.

331
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
From today on, he'll officially join

332
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
the guard of your palace,

333
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
and we'll be safe.

334
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Once we leave the capital, the attention of the guards

335
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
will increase. So to make it convenient,

336
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
we'll create an identity

337
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
to cooperate with the delegation.

338
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
After the war, the medicine is the most scarce.

339
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
So we'll be the medicine merchants of Chu.

340
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
We're afraid of danger along the way.

341
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
We'll act together

342
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
with the delegation.

343
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
The guard of the merchant team will be the frontman.

344
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Yuan Lu, you know him. He's the subordinate.

345
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
And the last one is...

346
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm the most important accountant of the merchant team,

347
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Yu Shi San.

348
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
I have a gift for you

349
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
when we first meet.

350
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
This is the one I picked up just now.

351
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
I hope you can see

352
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
the beautiful flowers.

353
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
So you can rest in peace.

354
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Here.

355
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Take it.

356
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
I saw you were not feeling well.

357
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
What did the doctor say?

358
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Since you left the capital,

359
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
you've been having a bad stomach.

360
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Since you left the capital,

364
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
you've been having a bad stomach.

365
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
We're in a hurry.

366
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
We didn't bring the doctor.

367
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Besides, a doctor like you

368
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
can't just ask a doctor from the private sector.

369
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Please forgive me.

370
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I didn't mean to get sick.

371
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
But I couldn't eat or sleep well on the way.

372
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Zhang Shi and Niu Guai

373
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
were always nagging at me

374
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
and forcing me to learn the things of the Dark Realm.

375
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
How did you learn it?

376
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Not bad.

377
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
It's not a big deal.

378
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,780
It's mostly because of the horse-drawn

379
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,780
That's good.

380
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
How about this?

381
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,780
I'll write a few prescriptions for His Highness.

382
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Okay.

383
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Then I'll write some prescriptions for His Highness.

384
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Then I'll write some prescriptions for His Highness.

385
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Then I'll write some prescriptions for His Highness.

386
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
How many princes are there in the Dark Realm?

387
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
What's their titles?

388
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Three.

389
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
One is called Luo...

390
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
King Luo Xi.

391
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
And two are...

392
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I just remembered.

393
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I suddenly can't remember.

394
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
I just remembered.

395
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
I just can't remember it all of a sudden.

396
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,600
Tao, didn't Brother Qian say that

397
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,300
the horse ride is too tiring.

398
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,700
Why don't you let Prince Li rest first?

399
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,300
Let's do it another day.

400
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,100
Okay. Since you're tired,

401
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,900
we'll take our leave.

402
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
Okay.

403
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,300
Ding Hui, come here.

404
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,600
Yes.

405
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,400
My lords, you've lost your jobs.

406
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm incompetent.

407
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,100
Your Highness has been feeling unwell lately.

408
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,100
I can't force you to come home.

409
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,700
Yes. Your Highness is too weak.

410
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,000
You miss the capital and cry when you're in a rush.

411
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I've reminded him many times.

412
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,700
But you're really talented.

413
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,200
Your Highness is actually quite smart.

414
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,300
But you're always in a rush.

415
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't know where to start.

416
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,800
I'll tell you more about it tomorrow.

417
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,700
I'll work harder to tell you more about it.

418
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,300
Yes.

419
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,400
What are you going to tell His Highness?

420
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,300
The grudges between our country and the An State.

421
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,200
The three princes and the ministers are all powerful.

422
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,400
The situation in the harem and the princes

423
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,900
are all under the control of the Emperor.

424
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,700
That's all?

425
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,200
That's all?

426
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Not even the imperial guards?

427
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Not even the power of the An State?

428
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,200
Not even the way we'll deal with the situation

429
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,400
if someone tries to make things difficult for us?

430
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,000
Only the three princes and ministers.

431
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,700
Let me remind you that General Chang Jing Hou

432
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,400
who took His Majesty away is just a simple prince.

433
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,000
How dare you!

434
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
You're just a beast!

435
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Okay. What else do you want to say?

436
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
Your Highness, don't be greedy.

437
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,500
Just tell me the most important thing.

438
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
After all, His Highness's responsibility is only to hand over the capital.

439
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,200
You're in charge of the negotiation with the An State.

440
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,800
That's right.

441
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,600
In the eyes of the world,

442
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Prince Li has been in different positions since he was young.

443
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,200
If he's too smart,

444
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,800
it's easy for the An State to suspect him.

445
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,000
If His Highness is a prince who cries all the time,

446
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,800
do you think the An State will suspect him?

447
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,400
Then how are you going to tell His Highness

448
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,200
about the?

449
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Noble Consort Chu?

450
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,000
Noble Consort Chu is the sister of Duke Chu's sister.

451
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Three years ago, she came to the palace and adored Duke Chu.

452
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
She was happy and kind to her sister.

453
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Enough.

454
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Thank you.

455
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Lord Du, after you arrive at the An State,

456
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
how are you going to negotiate with the An State?

457
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,200
I know the reason and I know the reason.

458
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,400
Naturally, I will still have to hand over the capital.

459
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,000
But if these three things are all over,

460
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
they still won't let go.

461
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,000
Even if we have to dethrone the whole troupe,

462
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
what should we do?

463
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
If it really comes to this,

464
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
I will go straight to the court

465
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,000
and make the An State angry

466
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
when it's full of officials.

467
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,200
Then I will die in peace

468
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
and be able to take the throne.

469
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
That's right.

470
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,600
Since we left the capital,

471
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,800
I have had a feeling of no return.

472
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
What?

473
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Well said.

474
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Where is our room?

475
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Go straight to the court and make the An State angry.

476
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
If you read too much, how will you play?

477
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,000
If the An State wants to cause trouble,

478
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,800
they just need to put our troupe in a secluded place.

479
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,400
They can't even get out of here.

480
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Come, let's make a bet.

481
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,400
How long will the little princess be exposed to the An State?

482
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
I bet a day.

483
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,000
Now we have to make a bet.

484
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,200
It will take two days.

485
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,400
At most half an hour.

486
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,000
This officer doesn't respect you.

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
How can we teach him a good lesson?

488
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
The little princess who grew up in the Cold Palace is so pitiful.

489
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Look, I knew it wasn't easy for you to find me.

490
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,400
But this Danyang King is also a drunkard.

491
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
He doesn't want you to go back,

492
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
but he doesn't want to be too obvious.

493
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Fortunately, he sent that Governor Du

494
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,000
who is a loyal official who doesn't know how to change.

495
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,200
If we mess this up,

496
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,600
it will be really hard for us.

497
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
What should we do?

498
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What should we do?

499
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,800
We can't change this Governor Du.

500
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,200
We have to find a way to get the Empress

501
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
to send a capable officer here.

502
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
There's no one else.

503
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
There are only a few female officers in the palace.

504
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,800
Unless you want to find an excuse

505
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,800
to call that beautiful and strong Pei.

506
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
But it seems that she has set a date.

507
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's not suitable.

508
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
Of course it's not suitable.

509
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Forget it.

510
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,600
If there's a beauty who knows nothing about the country,

511
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,200
who can come from the sky,

512
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
that would be great.

513
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
Take me to the palace.

514
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
I can do a lot of things for you.

515
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,800
First,

516
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,000
I know a lot about the palace and the court.

517
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,400
Yuan Luo,

518
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
immediately send a letter to the General Hall.

519
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,200
Tell them to call the party members back.

520
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,800
You must know where Mr. Yue is.

521
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,200
Yes.

522
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,600
Miss, come back.

523
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
Brother, there's a guest.

524
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Okay.

525
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Come.

526
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
The secret letter has been released.

527
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,600
Please rest assured.

528
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,800
Once that person appears,

529
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,600
it's a dead end.

530
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,200
But the people in the Six Halls have been removed.

531
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,800
I'm afraid there will be any changes.

532
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,200
You're afraid.

533
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
I dare not.

534
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,400
But the person you said escaped

535
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
has a drug problem.

536
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,600
Could it be a drug?

537
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,800
What's a drug?

538
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,000
Even if it's a single drug,

539
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
it will still kill the person who dare to harm our master.

540
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,600
Yes.

541
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I'll go take a look.

542
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,600
Miss, what kind of silk do you want?

543
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Xiao Si.

544
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm sorry, ladies.

545
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,200
Our shop closed today.

546
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,600
I'm sorry.

547
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,200
Thirty-six Palace, Tuhua Wall.

548
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,600
If the heavens have feelings, the heavens will be kind.

549
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Master Shen, you're still alive.

550
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
This is great.

551
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,000
I have urgent news to send back to the headquarters.

552
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Is there any news about Fei Ge?

553
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yes.

554
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,600
I'll take you to the secret room.

555
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
Please.

556
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Please.

557
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Who is she?

558
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
It's you?

559
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
You know her?

560
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,600
She's the head of the West Street Blue Fang Tower.

561
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Usually, she's the best at talking.

562
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Speak! Why are you here?

563
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,000
How did you get that flower and cut?

564
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,200
This morning, a woman gave me a pound of gold.

565
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,200
She told me to learn from her and then come here.

566
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh no. Oh no.

567
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,200
It was Zuo Shi who sent her here on purpose.

568
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,400
Now, we can't live anymore.

569
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,600
Zuo Shi? Chen Zuo Shi?

570
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
No.

571
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,800
It's... it's Ren Xi.

572
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Chen Zuo Shi?

573
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Impossible. He's dead.

574
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Send her back to the capital. Right now.

575
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Master, who is Ren Xi?

576
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,400
Don't mention her name.

577
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,400
We can safely return to Angu with these gold.

578
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,000
It's already God's blessing.

579
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,200
Why are you so afraid of her?

580
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,600
You've been in the Chinese Medical Corps for only two years.

581
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,200
Of course, you wouldn't know how scary she was back then.

582
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
In the eyes of the Chinese Medical Corps,

583
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,600
she was a legend.

584
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Back then, she was just a small Chinese Medical Corps.

585
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,400
But she fought against the enemy and made great contributions to the Great An.

586
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,800
She was promoted to the Purple Doctor by the command of the Red Division.

587
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,000
She was the most successful assassin of the Chinese Medical Corps.

588
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
As long as she made a move, she couldn't complete the mission.

589
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Nanping's surname was Wang.

590
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,600
The Chu people, the Empress Dowager, all gave up on her.

591
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,800
Later, she even died in a month

592
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,800
during the three-man battle of Fengxiang.

593
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,600
She was personally assassinated by His Majesty.

594
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,400
But why have I never heard of her?

595
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Five years ago, she was killed

596
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,400
and the assassin summoned the Empress.

597
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,400
After being captured, she was sent to the Imperial Prison.

598
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,400
His Majesty ordered her to be buried in the ashes

599
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,800
and asked no one to mention her name again.

600
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,800
But I never thought that she was still alive.

601
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
What's going on?

602
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,800
Li Wang!

603
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800
Li Wang!

604
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
Li Wang!

605
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,200
Li Wang!

606
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,800
Li Wang!

607
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,400
Li Wang!

608
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Li Wang!

609
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Go!

610
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,800
Go!

611
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,800
You sent me here on purpose?

612
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,200
I'm confused.

613
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,200
You're in the dark alone. I'm under the control of the people.

614
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,800
You deliberately led me away from the Kanyang Branch

615
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,800
and then attacked us half-way.

616
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,600
You really are a man of the people.

617
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Who are you?

618
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm the daughter of the Kanyang Branch's head of the Wu State.

619
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
When you were in danger,

620
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I was just a small Zhu Yizhou.

621
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,800
I didn't have the chance to receive your summoning.

622
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Since you recognize me, you should know my methods.

623
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Tell me.

624
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,200
As the head of the Wu State,

625
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
why did you betray your men

626
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,800
and kill 47 people in the Wu State?

627
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
How dare I tell you?

628
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
I wouldn't dare to tell you.

629
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This is the headquarters' order.

630
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm in danger. How dare I tell you?

631
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,400
Last year, I was the one who took 2,000 taels of gold from the Wu State

632
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,000
to buy the eunuch who was with Wu Di.

633
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But this amount was in the headquarters' account.

634
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,800
It was 5,000 taels.

635
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Someone in the headquarters was corrupt?

636
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
Yes.

637
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,400
The head of the Wu State found out about this.

638
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,600
The headquarters were afraid that he would report it.

639
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,800
Fortunately, they ordered me to kill him.

640
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
In order to make this work go smoothly,

641
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
I found the Six Halls.

642
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,600
They also wanted to take this opportunity to make a contribution.

643
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,000
So they gathered together.

644
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,200
The people of the Six Halls gave you 3,000 taels

645
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,600
to summon 47 people.

646
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Mr. Yue, your business is really good.

647
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Please forgive me.

648
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Don't you want to know who the person in the headquarters is?

649
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Do you know how to tell me?

650
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,800
As long as you spare my life, I will tell you everything.

651
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,000
That person is...

652
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,800
You are even shaking your sword.

653
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,200
It seems that Sister Wando is still working.

654
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
You really don't have any inner power.

655
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
No.

656
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,300
Kill them!

657
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:48,700
Yep

658
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I will not tell you.

659
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
If he can't reach me,

660
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
he will find you.

661
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
I will not tell you.

662
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Are you going to chase the princess?

663
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Why are you here?

664
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I came to find you

665
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
because I was worried about you.

666
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
You remember the place where you need me?

667
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
You regret not making a deal with me?

668
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Anyway,

669
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,600
do what you said that day.

670
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
You will tell the king

671
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
everything about Anguo.

672
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
I will help you find out

673
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
the real murderer who killed your benefactor.

674
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
The price has changed.

675
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
You need to send someone to the king

676
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
to send my aunt to her mother's house

677
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
and make sure

678
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I arrive safely before the capital.

679
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
No problem.

680
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
But I have to check it first.

681
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
If before entering Anguo,

682
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
the things you taught the prince

683
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
did not meet my standards,

684
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
then our deal is invalid.

685
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
You didn't even pay the deposit.

686
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
You want to empty your hands and rob the white wolf?

687
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I saved your life just now.

688
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
This is the deposit.

689
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
And you said

690
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
you don't like to owe others.

691
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Deal.

692
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
But I want you to make a vow.

693
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
You believe this?

694
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Believe?

695
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
I want you to make a vow

696
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
in the name of your brother.

697
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Okay.

698
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
I, Ning Yanzhou, the leader of the six halls,

699
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
make a vow in the name of my brother.

700
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
I will keep my promise.

701
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I will make a vow

702
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
that all brothers in the heaven will enter the hell.

703
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Never surrender to the gods.

704
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Okay?

705
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Say it again.

706
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
My name is not Ruyi.

707
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
It's Ren Xin.

708
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
The heart that changes the mind.

709
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
You are Ren Xin?

710
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Yes.

711
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
When I died five years ago,

712
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
you were not the leader of the hall.

713
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
You are just the leader of the hall.

714
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Ren Xin is a man.

715
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
And he is tall and has a scar on his face.

716
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
That's the identity I used

717
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
to assassinate the empress dowager of Chu.

718
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Just a mask.

719
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Don't you have six halls?

720
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Yes.

721
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Brother Yu is very good at it.

722
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
It seems that

723
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
your Hall of the Sun and the Sun's Hall

724
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
is not as powerful as

725
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Zhang Song's.

726
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
There are also many things that can't be found.

727
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
I regret making this deal.

728
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,600
But you have no choice now.

729
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Let's go, Yue Luo.

730
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Okay.

731
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Ren Xin is actually Ruyi.

732
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
This is good.

733
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Sister Ruyi dressed up as a man.

734
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Let Sister Ruyi go to teach the emperor.

735
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
She will definitely not show any flaws.

736
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Go!

737
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Go!

738
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Go!

739
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Tong Guang has saved the emperor this time.

740
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
You have made a great contribution.

741
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
You have not been awarded yet.

742
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I will now confer you as the first-class duke

743
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
and the general of the imperial guards.

744
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Congratulations, my lord.

745
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
You have passed the test today.

746
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
General Lin Wei is the new father of the emperor.

747
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
Yes.

748
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Who doesn't know that

749
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
the emperor has always treated my lord

750
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,600
like his own son.

751
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
My lord,

752
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
the bird over there was caught by

753
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Luo Xi's followers.

754
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
He must not give it to him.

755
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
My lord,

756
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
the bird is not here.

757
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
It's not here.

758
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
It's not here.

759
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Go!

760
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
I promoted him

761
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
just to beat up two scoundrels.

762
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Once I leave the battle,

763
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
these two kids will not be at peace.

764
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,600
My lord,

765
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Marquis Changqing is a stone.

766
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
I want to use it

767
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,600
to grind the unsightly blades.

768
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
I understand.

769
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Letting him take over the imperial guards

770
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
is to keep him in the capital.

771
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Should I give him a jade stone

772
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,600
to give him a way to gain military power?

773
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
My lord,

774
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
someone was behind the tree.

775
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
It's Marquis Changqing.

776
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Did he hear it?

777
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
He heard it on purpose.

778
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
Bastard!

779
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
He can't even see the bird.

780
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
He's not even able to see the bird.

781
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
He's not even able to see the bird.

782
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Go!

783
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
He can't even see the bird.

784
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
What happened?

785
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I saw you were worried

786
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
about the scoundrel.

787
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
So I came to you.

788
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Nothing.

789
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Tell me.

790
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Or I'll be mad.

791
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I know.

792
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
He just gave birth to me.

793
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Then he tried to suppress me.

794
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
It's nothing.

795
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Giving birth is a good thing.

796
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
Besides,

797
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
you have to be patient.

798
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
I know.

799
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
He heard it on purpose.

800
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
So I had to be mad.

801
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,600
If I had to be patient like Yan Qicheng,

802
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
he would have been more worried about me.

803
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,600
You are too deep in your heart.

804
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Not deep, not deep.

805
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
Not always rational.

806
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
How can you achieve our dream?

807
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,600
I hope you lose your rationality.

808
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
Losing your rationality to me.

809
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Li Tongguang,

810
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
you know I'm fascinated by you.

811
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
But I'm not a fool.

812
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,600
For so long,

813
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,600
you've never been close to me.

814
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
You think I'm dirty, right?

815
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Kill him.

816
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Or we'll be late.

817
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
My lord.

818
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
My lord.

819
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
My lord.

820
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
My lord.

821
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
My lord.

822
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
My lord, please.

823
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
My lord, please.

824
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Close your eyes.

825
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
Close your eyes.

826
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
I won't say anything.

827
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,600
It'll be over soon.

828
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,600
My lord, please.

829
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
What did you call me?

830
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Liuli.

831
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Nine years ago,

832
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,600
I served you with my lord.

833
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
One.

834
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
Remember this humiliation.

835
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,600
You won't lose next time.

836
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,600
I'm sorry.

837
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,600
I'm sorry.

838
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Li Li.

839
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
I love you.

840
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
I love you.
