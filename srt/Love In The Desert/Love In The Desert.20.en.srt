=Episode 20=

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,340
Greetings, Brother.

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,500
I really appreciate

26
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,780
how you care for me.

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,140
But my back hasn't recovered yet.

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,340
I can't get into water.

29
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,940
Hasn't recovered?

30
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,830
Sorry, I'm being inconsiderate.

31
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,990
The weather is nice today.

32
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,510
So, I wanted you to bathe
and get rid of the chill.

33
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,580
I didn't know your injury was...

34
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,900
Come on. Sit down for some tea.

35
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,830
Brother, you can understand

36
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,460
and I really appreciate it.

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,830
I dispatched troops

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,620
for an emergency.

39
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,710
I disobeyed you, Brother.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,950
Please forgive me.

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,390
I can't interfere with your business.

42
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,830
But the lashes...

43
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,790
Your back hurts.

44
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,860
And my heart hurts.

45
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,990
In recent days,

46
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,740
I can't eat or sleep well.

47
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,740
I have a lot of dreams.

48
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,110
I often think of the fun stories

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,420
we had in our childhood.

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,580
How time flies!

51
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,620
So soon, we're nearly 30.

52
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,390
Brother, you work day and night.

53
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,780
Maybe you suffer from overwork.

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,950
It's my fault.

55
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,830
Don't blame yourself.

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,020
I have a present for you.

57
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,670
Do you remember this?

58
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,950
In childhood,

59
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,140
we were naughty and we fought.

60
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,670
I snatched it from you.

61
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,180
Later, I lied

62
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,140
that it was lost.

63
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,990
A mere jade pendant.

64
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,420
If you like it, keep it.

65
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,860
Father gave it to you.

66
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,550
It doesn't belong to me.

67
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,630
Brother,

68
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,860
Father passed away.

69
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,590
Whatever it is,

70
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,350
what's yours is always yours.

71
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,860
I'd never rebel.

72
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,670
You and I are brothers.

73
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,790
If we had an after-life,

74
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,230
hope we could still be brothers.

75
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,060
I wish you and I would be

76
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,940
the children of an ordinary family.

77
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,950
Action!

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,900
Brother,

79
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,150
don't be deceived by outsiders.

80
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,260
Somebody.

81
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,550
Leave us.

82
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,550
So, you're really rebellious.

83
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,230
How dare you?

84
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,940
Point at His Lordship with a sword?

85
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,500
Put it down now

86
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,550
and you won't die.

87
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,060
Brother, today,

88
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,860
you gave me a present.

89
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,990
I also have a present

90
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,910
for you.

91
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,780
(To Liu Qi)

92
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,260
(Use Huo Yanqi to kill Huo Qingyun.)

93
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,550
Liu Qi,

94
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,860
how long have you colluded with Yunpei?

95
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,310
Framed.

96
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,230
I'm framed.

97
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,740
Who wrote this?

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,940
I don't know.

99
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,780
You don't?

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,220
Fine.

101
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,060
Let me recall it for you.

102
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,830
Brother,

103
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,980
this is a report Na Zhan reviewed.

104
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,100
(By Commander Wang Qishang)

105
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,420
His handwriting is the same

106
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,420
as in this letter.

107
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,300
This evil man

108
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,860
has served me for years!

109
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,350
I've been breeding evil!

110
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,670
My Lord, don't believe
such an evil accusation.

111
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,750
This letter...

112
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,500
It must be faked!

113
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,110
Stop denying it!

114
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,790
Colluding with our enemy,

115
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,150
you deserve a miserable death!

116
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,630
My Lord,

117
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,110
I did so many things for you.

118
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,300
You can't discard me just for this.

119
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,910
Don't you remember
I risked my life to...?

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,970
I'll kill you.

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
Brother,

122
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,300
don't be angry.

123
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,860
Give him to me.

124
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,870
Qingyun,

125
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,990
don't trust his gibberish.

126
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,030
He's poisoning you against me.

127
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,670
I won't believe what he says.

128
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,860
Like you said,

129
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,990
he's an outsider.

130
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,060
- Somebody.
- Here.

131
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,500
- Take him away.
- Yes.

132
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,430
Move.

133
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,430
Qingyun,

134
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,550
this guy provoked me.

135
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,070
If you

136
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,820
prefer to be the Lord,

137
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,590
I'll make you.

138
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,910
From now on, I'll move to the mountains

139
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,230
and never come out again.

140
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,580
Brother,

141
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,180
I'd never rebel.

142
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,860
We'll always serve you, My Lord,

143
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,110
even at the risk of our lives.

144
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,620
We pledge our loyalty.

145
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,670
He's tough.

146
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,830
Can't make him talk.

147
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,500
Boa Agents can do extreme torture.

148
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,660
It hasn't been used for a long time.

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,470
Use a sharp knife

150
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,140
to sting through his skin

151
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,780
and leave a tiny hole.

152
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,990
When stabbed,

153
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,020
he won't die immediately.

154
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,540
He'll just lose all his strength

155
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,900
as if he's a puppet.

156
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,060
You make your choice.

157
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,990
Where shall we start,

158
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,350
from your head or foot?

159
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,430
Mercy, Your Lordship.

160
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,070
Be patient.

161
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,070
I'd like to see what is tougher,

162
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,660
your tongue or my knife?

163
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,660
Your knife, of course.

164
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,780
I'm a coward.

165
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,660
Please spare me.

166
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,230
Na Zhan and I

167
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,380
have communicated for two years.

168
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,540
Na Zhan promised me
the best house in Yunpei.

169
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,310
He also took my parents

170
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,590
to Yunpei.

171
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,270
He said

172
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,430
he would look after them for me.

173
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,190
Your Lordship,

174
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,230
I've kept all the letters from Na Zhan.

175
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,860
I'll give them to you.

176
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,830
The Ninth Lady of Masui

177
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,380
and the Ninth Princess
are heading for Tiandu.

178
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,990
Once they get in town,

179
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,500
await an opportunity

180
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,030
to kill them.

181
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,230
I know I'm wrong.

182
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,140
Just as I received the letter,

183
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,500
the two of them came to Tiandu.

184
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
You ordered to kill Masui soldiers

185
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,110
and let them go.

186
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,260
I faked another order.

187
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,990
And they are trapped at the city gate.

188
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,900
Orders, Your Lordship?

189
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,860
Will we help?

190
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,900
Shoot those Masui soldiers who hunt them.

191
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,950
Let go of the two women.

192
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,790
Yes.

193
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,990
What order did you give?

194
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,330
"Kill

195
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,580
them all."

196
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:12,180
(Tiandu)

197
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,020
Your Lordship, she's dead.

198
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,710
Bury

199
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,190
this lady.

200
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

201
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,700
Chief!

202
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,310
Chief, he can't die.

203
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,380
If he dies,

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,620
you can't explain anything.

205
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,350
Give him paper and ink.

206
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,803
He'll write a letter of confession.

207
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,380
You...

208
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,390
Are you going to see her?

209
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,500
No.

210
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,950
When possible,

211
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,190
give her the letter

212
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,780
and explain everything to her.

213
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,790
Are you sure

214
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,260
you won't try again?

215
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,460
You

216
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,020
and Boa Agents

217
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,260
are waiting to take revenge.

218
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,070
How can I dwell in love?

219
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,710
What did you come for?

220
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,670
Chief,

221
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,230
on Miss Beishuang's way back to Yunpei

222
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,190
after sending away her clansmen,

223
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,830
she was kidnapped by Ruo Wen

224
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,790
of Desert Rankers.

225
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,740
(Heyan Mansion)

226
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,580
Look.

227
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,500
It was Masui and now it's Fentian.

228
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,310
Congratulations. You've got what you want.

229
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,150
No.

230
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,660
This is what we both want.

231
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,990
Huang Beishuang, remember.

232
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,230
I'm a master falconer.

233
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,140
No falcon will peck my eyes.

234
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,740
One more thing.

235
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,590
I want to make a deal with you.

236
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,260
Masui is impregnable
with complicated terrains.

237
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,110
There's a great trick in this pouch.

238
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,350
The location of the Lord's Mansion

239
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,070
and the rota of the guards.

240
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,710
How do you have this?

241
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,950
The Architecture Volume
is in Masui, I guess.

242
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,430
I want you to find it

243
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,860
and give it to me.

244
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,270
Deal.

245
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,860
Fentian is built.

246
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,070
What about the book I want?

247
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,070
I haven't found it yet.

248
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,140
You broke your promise.

249
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,190
Be patient. I promised to help you.

250
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,260
And I have a big present for you.

251
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,230
Why do you take me here?

252
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,350
Your big present is here.

253
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,710
- Bring him in.
- Yes.

254
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,500
Move.

255
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,110
My Lord, he's here.

256
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,500
My Lord, do you know her?

257
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,430
You...

258
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,430
It's you.

259
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,950
Come on. Kill him yourself.

260
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,620
I am...

261
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,470
Lord of Masui...

262
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,340
You...

263
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,620
You're all mine.

264
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,260
You're insane.

265
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,900
Killing you now

266
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,380
will be mercy.

267
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,660
Who dares to kill me?

268
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,950
I'm the Lord of Masui.

269
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,780
You killed your brother for the throne,

270
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,260
murdered loyal officials,

271
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,380
and mistreated your people.

272
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,070
You ruined the century-old city.

273
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,070
How dare you call yourself Lord of Masui?

274
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,070
Kill my brother?

275
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,540
Ge'er Re was indecisive.

276
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,950
He was a nice guy,

277
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,230
but not a good lord.

278
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,470
Na Zhan kept offering us the alliance,

279
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,190
but he always rejected it.

280
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,380
I would rather accept it for him.

281
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,830
Na Zhan?

282
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,950
Yes.

283
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,540
Without his help,

284
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,780
how could I kill Ge'er Re that easily?

285
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,070
You beast.

286
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,900
I shouldn't have let you go.

287
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,350
You jinx.

288
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,590
Again.

(Father,)

301
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,750
(Mother,)

302
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,950
(your daughter is back.)

303
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,260
(I killed Ge'er Jinqin.)

304
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,230
(Before, I was deceived)

305
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,110
(and didn't know the truth.)

306
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,740
(Then, I let Na Zhan go.)

307
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,100
(One day, when I take revenge,)

308
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,580
(I'll make him pay with blood.)

309
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,390
(By then, I'll come back here)

310
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,260
(and completely grieve for you.)

311
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,260
(Huo Qingyun from Tiandu)

312
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,150

(We love and hate.)

314
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,430
(It's hard to break up.)

315
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,390
(I know he's the enemy
who killed my mother.)

316
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,060
(But I still can't kill him.)

317
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,230
(Father,)

318
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,420
(Mother,)

319
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,300
(can you forgive me?)

320
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,820
I knew you were here.

321
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,190
Thank you for all this.

322
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,230
You're welcome.

323
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,990
And it's for Ge...

324
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,470
For that madwoman.

325
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,020
I told you,

326
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,740
whatever I want, I get it.

327
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,180
Ruo Wen,

328
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,820
I made use of you.

329
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,430
No one can make use of me.

330
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,500
It's my will to take Masui.

331
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,710
Thank you

332
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,820
for letting me kill my enemy, but...

333
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,150
I haven't found the book yet.

334
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,820
What's the mystery in your eyes

335
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,430
that makes me fall?

336
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,910
How about you tell me?

337
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,510
Ruo Wen,

338
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,990
you know very well

339
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,820
that you don't like me.

340
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,670
Don't bother to read my mind.

341
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,190
Ruo Wen, put me down.

342
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,030
Don't struggle.

343
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,620
Ruo Wen,

344
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,190
I know you haven't given up.

345
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,710
What are you doing?

346
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,580
How dare you yell at me?

347
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,740
Still looking?

348
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,900
Are you all right?

349
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,900
I'm fine.

350
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,260
You're right.

351
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,780
I'm here in Masui.

352
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,670
You killed Ge'er Jinqin.

353
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,100
If you want to come back...

354
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,110
You're the real Ge Xinwei.

355
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,020
I'll leave after I find the Desert Scroll.

356
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,540
The Desert Scroll?

357
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,670
All right. I'll help you.

358
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,470
You're familiar here.

359
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,270
Where shall we check?

360
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,110
The inner mansion.

361
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,950
I failed my job

362
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,500
due to my negligence.

363
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,940
Ridiculous!

364
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,300
Do you know

365
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,340
who Huang Beishuang is?

366
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
The First Lady of Yunpei.

367
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,780
What about Ruo Wen?

368
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,300
The Lord of Fentian.

369
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,230
Do you know the stakes?

370
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,670
Her Ladyship is kidnapped.

371
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,340
It's a burning shame to us.

372
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,430
If people know about it,

373
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,630
there has to be a war.

374
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,540
Or our city will be disgraced.

375
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Before you get back Huang Beishuang,

376
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,470
don't let anyone know this.

377
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,380
No word of this must leave here.

378
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,340
Got it?

379
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,230
Yes.

380
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,660
My Lord,

381
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,580
can I lead a squad to save Her Ladyship

382
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
and make it up?

383
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,470
Get her back in such a big way?

384
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,100
Isn't it shameful, Wu Jihai?

385
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,940
Forget it.

386
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,790
Since she

387
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,740
managed to escape from Ruo Wen,

388
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,990
she could do that again.

389
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,910
I still hold

390
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,780
Enaqi people.

391
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,390
She won't stay there.

392
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,060
But she isn't the princess of Enaqi.

393
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,710
Will she really care?

394
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,430
She will.

395
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,020
She'll be back.

396
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,750
My Lord,

397
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,910
if Ruo Wen kills her...

398
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,740
You idiot.

399
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,710
Get out!

400
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,270
Yes.

401
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,260
Chief, Mr. Sha,

402
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,630
Lady Beishuang is in Fentian.

403
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,190
Since Ruo Wen ruled the city,

404
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,230
former servants have been dismissed.

405
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,190
He uses new servants.

406
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,230
We haven't planted new spies yet.

407
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,950
So, we don't know
what's happening in there.

408
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,230
I get it.

409
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,630
- Leave us.
- Yes.

410
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,660
Chief.

411
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,710
Tomorrow, I'll try

412
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,020
to sneak into Feitian and check

413
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,510
before we think of a plan.

414
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,470
What do you say?

415
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,340
No need.

416
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,670
Ruo Wen is arrogant and insane.

417
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,560
But he's straightforward, too.

418
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,230
We don't need to beat about the bush.

419
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,230
Tomorrow, I'll go to his mansion.

420
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,150
Who on earth are you?

421
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,250
Give it back to me.

422
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,990
Give it back.

423
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,580
Do you love her eyes that much?

424
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Shall I dig them out for you?

425
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,820
You also think
she has Huang Beishuang's eyes?

426
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,710
Yes. Is it not her?

427
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,260
Ruo Wen, you're possessed.

428
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,950
You're spaced out all day.

429
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,420
All you care for are eyes.

430
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,910
I don't think her eyes are great.

431
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,830
Look at my eyes.

432
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,220
- Pretty, aren't they?
- I won't look.

433
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,540
I said, look at my eyes.

434
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,510
I just won't.

435
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,540
You have to.

436
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
Ruo Wen,

437
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,950
don't come to me if you dare.

438
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,990
If I come to you again,

439
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,390
you'll be a dog.

440
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,380
Woof, woof.

441
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,700
(Fentian)

442
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,510
Chief.

443
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,910
Huo Qingyun is here.

444
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,750
What for?

445
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,510
I won't see him.

446
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,150
With some treasures,

447
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,780
I'm here to congratulate you
on your new city.

448
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,660
What?

449
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,830
I'm unwelcome?

450
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,990
Leave the presents.

451
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,620
You go away.

452
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,870
Is this how you treat a visitor?

453
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,950
Fentian is newly built.
Why would you expel a visitor?

454
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,070
Besides,

455
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,407
I have a deal to make with you.

456
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,790
Fox,

457
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,070
the throne doesn't feel good.

458
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,510
Smash it and get me a new one.

459
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,470
Yes.

460
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
We blew up your den.

461
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,710
Sorry for that.

462
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,030
I'll drink this

463
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,190
as an apology.

464
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,190
I'm always fair.

465
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,670
Boa Agents helped me take Masui.

466
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,630
I'll drink with you.

467
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,340
In Yunpei,

468
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,150
you helped me get away.

469
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,830
I'll drink this

470
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,340
as a gratitude.

471
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,060
One cup of wine isn't enough

472
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,820
for your life.

473
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,900
Fine.

474
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,140
Three cups, then.

475
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,380
All right.

476
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,580
Why did you save me?

477
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,540
I have few rivals.

478
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,380
You're one.

479
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,380
Even if you're dead,

480
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,780
you should be dead by my hand.

481
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,060
If one day I capture you,

482
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,100
what you said today can keep you alive.

483
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,230
What do you say?

484
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,990
Do you think that will happen?

485
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,070
You owe me

486
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,630
your life.

487
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,950
Let's wait and see.

488
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,070
All right.

489
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,820
You know what I came here for.

490
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,470
Then, you'll leave empty-handed.

491
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,340
I have a man.

492
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,230
Maybe you want to see him.

493
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,900
Who?

494
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,870
Rong Huo.

495
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,620
I don't know him.

496
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,190
He's a former official in Yunpei

497
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,100
who served Na Qida,
the late lord of Yunpei.

498
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,230
Not interested.

499
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,780
(Does he pretend he doesn't know him?)

500
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,420
(Or...)

501
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,910
(Is he not Rong An?)

502
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,470
Even if he's Rong An,

503
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
it's been 15 years.

504
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,100
People change.

505
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,790
Young Lord,

506
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,630
be very careful.

507
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,950
Before you totally control him,

508
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,580
do not reveal yourself.

509
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,100
What is your point?

510
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,430
He claims to be your uncle.

511
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,830
And of course,

512
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,990
maybe it's because

513
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,340
you're the Lord of Fentian

514
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,900
and he wants to play up to you.

515
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,153
Small talk is over. Let's drink.

516
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,710
Where is he?

517
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,780
Since you don't know him,

518
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,163
I can't tell you where he is.

519
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,870
I was injured in my childhood.

520
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,710
I don't remember

521
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
a lot of things.

522
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,100
You want to see him.

523
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,110
Maybe he'll remind you of something.

524
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,100
That's not necessary.

525
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,190
In this case,

526
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,430
I'll get it straight.

527
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,830
Name your price.

528
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,990
I'll take away Huang Beishuang.

529
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,340
Anything but this.

530
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,900
With this token,

531
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,430
you can get any intel from Boa Agents.

532
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,710
Fine.

533
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
You can see her.

534
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,750
But take her away...

535
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,723
Don't even think about it.

536
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,510
Cheers.

537
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,380
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

538
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,123
Do you really hate to see me?

539
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,070
Since you know,

540
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,300
why do you pester me?

541
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,990
Your Lordship,

542
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,180
behave yourself.

543
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,990
After I take you away from Fentian,

544
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,110
I won't pester you anymore.

545
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,300
I appreciate it.

546
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,710
But I volunteered to come here.

547
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,230
I want to talk about your mother.

548
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,990
If you feel guilty,

549
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,300
get out of here now,

550
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,150
in case you disturb her in heaven.

551
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,300
Someone else killed your mother.

552
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,100
My Lord,

553
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,900
My Lady,

554
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,430
if you're in heaven,

555
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,870
please be my witnesses.

556
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,910
If I fake anything,

557
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,230
put me to Hell

558
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,030
and I will

559
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,390
spend eternity in limbo.

560
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,420
(Letter of Confession)
I'm Liu Qi,

561
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,870
the eunuch of the Lord of Tiandu.

562
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,870
Bribed by Na Zhan, Lord of Yunpei,

563
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,060
I betrayed my master

564
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,910
and offered intel to Yunpei.

565
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,500
In the past two years, Na Zhan and I
have had over a hundred letters.

566
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,390
Now, I exchange them

567
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,990
for my life.

568
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,230
At the city gate of Tiandu,

569
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,780
I ordered to shoot
the Lady and the Princess of Masui

570
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,190
under the command of Na Zhan.

571
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,390
The Ninth Lady and the Ninth Princess

572
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,740
are heading for Tiandu.

573
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,470
Once they get in town,
await an opportunity to kill them.

574
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,500
It's Na Zhan's handwriting.

575
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,500
But I heard it was the order
of the Lord of the North.

576
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,390
I ordered to shoot

577
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,580
Masui soldiers who hunt you

578
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,950
and let the two of you go.

579
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,020
Liu Qi faked an order

580
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,580
and pretended it was manslaughter.

581
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,580
Sorry.

582
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,580
It's my fault.

583
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,990
I got your mother killed.

584
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,910
My sin can't be redeemed.
