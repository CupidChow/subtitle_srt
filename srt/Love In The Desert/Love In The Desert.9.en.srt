Lady Beishuang.

My Lady,

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
where have you been?

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,980
I've been looking for you.

33
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,670
I was separated from everybody

34
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,870
and I lost my way.

35
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,730
The show is about to begin.

36
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,110
Please come with me.

37
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,460
Let's not be late.

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,830
Mr. Rong,

39
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,990
look around.

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,510
Under my administration,

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,740
Yunpei has been so prosperous
with rich and happy people.

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,420
What still worries you?

43
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,460
There's nothing I worry about.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,300
Today, you held the lantern show

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,110
among common people.

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,420
Chief, everything is ready.

47
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,790
I guess you want to celebrate with them.

48
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,990
It's very thought of you.

49
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,110
You know what?

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,580
When one is powerful enough,

51
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,110
everything in this world

52
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,860
will surrender at his feet.

53
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,140
Is Yunpei

54
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,860
really this thriving?

55
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,110
If everything is as true as I see,

56
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,900
I'd wish Yunpei

57
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,420
a great prosperity forever.

58
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,070
Thanks, then.

59
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,550
Blessed by His Lordship,

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,580
Yunpei has enjoyed prosperity and peace.

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,390
Today, His Lordship
will celebrate with his people

62
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,350
and pray with them.

63
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,860
His Lordship hereby permits

64
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,700
people in Yunpei oases
will not pay tax for one year.

65
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,670
No free for grains and livestock.

66
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,790
- Great. Thank you, My Lord.
- Thank you, My Lord.

67
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,270
Felons can get a reduced sentence.

68
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,790
Minor offenders can pay a bail

69
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,500
to save themselves from penalty.

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,060
Great.

71
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,910
- Thank you, My Lord.
- Thank you, My Lord.

72
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,380
This month, young men

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,260
who serve the city or join the army

74
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,550
can get ten taels of silver each.

75
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,420
Yeah!

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,590
Next, performers will come up.

77
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,790
Nice!

78
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,230
(Huo Qingyun?)

79
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,230
(Why is he disguised as a performer?)

80
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,940
How are our preparations?

81
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,260
Don't worry, Chief.

82
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,300
- All ready.
- All ready.

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,260
Off you go.

84
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,590
Come on. Let's go.

85
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,620
(Oh, no. Qingyun is in danger.)

86
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,740
My Lord, wish you good health.

87
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,420
May Yunpei always be
prosperous and peaceful.

88
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,420
Today, I've made you

89
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,300
the five-flavor herbal tea.

90
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,910
Look, My Lord.

91
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,180
These five cups of tea
not only taste good

92
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,060
but also offer nourishment.

93
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,620
Keep looking, My Lord.

94
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,420
The five cups of tea

95
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,990
have different colors.

96
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,620
They represent

97
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,860
heart, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney.

98
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,550
Nourishment to the five organs
makes you live longer.

99
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,260
There are also refined grains in the tea.

100
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,150
It means Yunpei

101
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,590
will have bountiful harvests

102
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,670
and incredible peace.

103
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,190
Good.

104
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,510
Really good.

105
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,870
What?

106
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,300
Shouldn't you offer me some tea?

107
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,750
Nice tea.

108
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,590
Guys, pray for Yunpei

109
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,990
with me.

110
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,470
Wish our city

111
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,150
great prosperity

112
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,590
and bountiful harvests.

113
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,590
Who blew the action whistle?

114
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,550
I don't know.

115
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,830
Not a chance today.

116
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,030
Youjia, I wonder

117
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,860
what present you'll offer His Lordship.

118
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,590
Don't worry about me.

119
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,110
My Lord, I only prepared some tea.

120
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,430
However,

121
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,060
I have something precious for you.

122
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,350
So, you got a present for me?

123
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,380
My Lord, this is the White Tiger Cup.

124
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,110
A rare treasure of my tribe.

125
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,780
Wet it before making tea.

126
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,350
The tea will remain fresh and sweet.

127
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,380
It won't get cold, either.

128
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,620
Now, I'm giving it to you, My Lord.

129
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,310
It's a rare treasure, indeed.

130
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,350
Congratulations, My Lord.

131
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,230
Nice tea in a fancy cup.

132
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,260
One offered nice tea.

133
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,900
The other offered a fancy cup.

134
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,830
It's thoughtful of you,

135
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,950
my ladies.

136
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,950
Chief,

137
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,490
why did you blow a retreat whistle?

138
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,340
I didn't blow that.

139
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,590
There's a peer here.

140
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,020
No way.

141
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,710
Let's sit down and watch.

142
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,990
This is all my performance.

143
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,950
Thanks for watching.

144
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,710
We enjoy it and you deserve a reward.

145
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,590
What reward do you want?

146
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,780
Money?

147
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,740
Some office?

148
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,230
Or a woman?

149
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,140
My Lord, it is my duty

150
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,620
to perform for you.

151
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,310
I don't deserve a reward.

152
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,260
I'm just very thirsty.

153
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,020
May I ask for a cup of tea

154
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,470
Her Ladyship just made?

155
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,350
Such an unusual reward.

156
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,780
One cup isn't enough.

157
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,990
You'll have a pot of it.

158
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,350
Na Zhan has a lot of nasty rules.

159
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,860
Thank you, My Lord.

160
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,590
The tea is cold.

161
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,700
But my heart is hot.

162
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,070
Leave us.

163
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,620
Yes.

164
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,790
My Lord,

165
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,260
today, our men took over

166
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,830
a big fertile oasis

167
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,950
and sieged hundreds of bandits.

168
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,780
Please handle this oasis.

169
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,350
General Wu,

170
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,470
thanks for your hard work.

171
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,430
My Lord,

172
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,140
this oasis is rare and hard-earned.

173
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,500
The two ladies

174
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,310
balance each other in the art of tea

175
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,860
and can hardly win.

176
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,950
I have a proposition.

177
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,350
Why don't they compete

178
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,470
and see who will win?

179
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,590
Best two out of three.

180
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,500
The winner can get this oasis.

181
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,620
She can also earn a place to live

182
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,780
for her own tribe.

183
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,620
Just what I want.

184
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,020
We can't move today.

185
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,150
Fall back.

186
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,430
Let's go.

187
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,230
The whistle blow was weird.

188
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,470
Did Na Zhan play a trick?

189
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,190
This fair is guarded

190
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,780
by Yunpei soldiers.

191
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,620
If we moved abruptly,

192
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,110
we'd fall into his trap.

193
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,590
That's exactly what he wants.

194
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,260
But Na Zhan didn't blow the whistle.

195
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,140
I guess he heard it

196
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,350
but didn't know what it meant.

197
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,860
Then who blew it?

198
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,550
Sha Qu,

199
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,990
have our men check on Desert Rankers.

200
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,870
I must know where Ruo Wen is.

201
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,830
Yes.

202
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,950
Chief, shall we move on

203
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,910
and attack again?

204
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,770
Not now.

205
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,260
Let's secretly find out where Rong Huo is.

206
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,350
At the lantern show, he looked florid

207
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,460
and neatly dressed.

208
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,540
I don't think he's kept in a dungeon.

209
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,860
I guess he is taken good care of.

210
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,780
We were searching the wrong places.

211
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,860
If one lives in a dungeon,

212
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,990
he'll have dark skin,
flagging spirit, and weak bones.

213
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,350
But Rong Huo looks vigorous.

214
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,470
His room must be available to sunlight.

215
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,100
The front yard.

216
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,740
The backyard.

217
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,980
All the chambers.

218
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,020
These places are crowded.

219
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,540
Nobody can be hidden there.

220
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,590
Apart from that,

221
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,260
there are very few places.

222
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,310
Let's make a comeback.

223
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,660
Silly man.

224
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,620
(Miss you.)

225
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,430
My Lord,

226
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,660
when we cleaned up
after the lantern show,

227
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,190
we found this on the stage.

228
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,430
It's made of some iron

229
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,590
out of our city.

230
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,430
What does the yellow ribbon mean?

231
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,230
I don't know.

232
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,550
General Wu,

233
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,710
do you know the whistle blows?

234
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,470
On the battlefield,

235
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,590
drums and horns are used to give orders.

236
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,900
I think whistles are used by bandits.

237
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,860
I don't know too much.

238
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,590
As the general of Yunpei,

239
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,780
you're utterly ignorant.

240
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,860
Oh, General Wu.

241
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,070
At the lantern show last night,

242
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,740
I exempted people from taxes.

243
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,990
I want you

244
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,260
to get them back from weaker tribes.

245
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,780
Can you do that?

246
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,710
I will, My Lord.

247
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,070
Rest assured, My Lord.

248
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,910
Good.

249
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,220
Very good.

250
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,540
A chess player

251
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,830
never cares

252
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,590
what pieces he directs.

253
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Since the pieces move,

254
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,710
do not let them

255
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
stop.

256
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,800
It's wise of you, My Lord.

257
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,710
Yesterday, those bandits

258
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,740
must have come for Rong Huo.

259
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,190
Shall we strictly guard him

260
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,020
or move him somewhere else?

261
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,620
You've worked for me for years

262
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,310
but haven't improved at all.

263
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,660
I get it, My Lord.

264
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,310
Since they have come,

265
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,500
we should give them

266
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,140
a really good lesson.

267
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,430
Draw them out.

268
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,370
Fancy pendants.

269
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,900
I'm so exhausted.

270
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,140
Chief,

271
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
I caught two snoops

272
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,940
and asked about it.

273
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,630
Have some water and speak.

274
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,550
They told me

275
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,060
in Yunpei,

276
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,300
there are indeed Boa Agents.

277
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,340
In a teahouse in the west of town.

278
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,260
The teahouse is open
for business in the day.

279
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,470
But in the night,

280
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,710
those who have intel

281
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,390
go there at the hour of Xu.

282
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,620
Fox,

283
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,390
are you sure a Boa Agent

284
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,510
blew the whistle last night?

285
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,470
No one else

286
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,580
understands our whistle.

287
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,910
Then why did they blow a retreat whistle?

288
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,470
Idiot.

289
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,870
Do you even have to ask?

290
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,190
Boa Agents must have

291
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,820
colluded with Na Zhan.

292
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,340
Where's the madwoman?

293
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,230
Who?

294
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,100
Ge Xinwei.

295
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,090
Chief,

296
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,430
wasn't she with you last night?

297
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,510
I didn't see her.

298
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,380
Yeah.

299
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,660
Come with me.

300
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,940
Let's handle everything together.

301
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,180
- Let's go.
- All right.

302
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,790
Old guy.

303
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,020
Thank you, gentlemen.

304
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,660
(Teahouse)

305
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,670
Get us some fancy tea!

306
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,070
Be seated, please.

307
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,710
Get us your shopkeeper.

308
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,020
He isn't in.

309
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,670
Let's go.

310
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,990
Shopkeeper,

311
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,510
show yourself.

312
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,780
It's indeed you.

313
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,340
I want to see your head.

314
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,540
Get him out.

315
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,380
We meet again.

316
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Am I unwelcome?

317
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,630
Not at all.

318
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,950
We live in the same world.

319
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,630
We won't laugh at each other.

320
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,620
Take your seat.

321
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,020
Gentlemen, this way, please.

322
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,660
Make some tea.

323
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,150
You blew up my den
and took away my woman.

324
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,430
Now, I'm coming for you.

325
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,380
Cool guy.

326
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,100
I'll be straightforward, too.

327
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,100
What do you want?

328
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,230
To burn your teahouse

329
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,710
and cut off your head.

330
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,020
Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers.

331
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,430
What you want

332
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,540
is too little.

333
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,100
I love negotiation. How about...?

334
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,990
Too bad.

335
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,950
I hate negotiation.

336
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,020
I take those I like and kill those I don't.

337
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,260
You can risk your life.

338
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,950
But your men need somewhere to stay.

339
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,780
Just get it to me straight.

340
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,470
Your den was blown up.

341
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,910
You have nowhere to settle down.

342
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,340
What?

343
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,300
Will you

344
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,670
lead a wandering life?

345
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,670
I may hire more men or take a city.

346
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,910
Who knows

347
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,260
if Yunpei

348
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,910
will have a new ruler?

349
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,780
To take a city,

350
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,380
you need weapons.

351
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,070
I know a man

352
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,580
named Qin Duo.

353
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,830
He's a womanizer,

354
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,940
living in Liuyue Lane in the east of town.

355
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,300
He's in charge of Yunpei's arsenal.

356
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,150
With those weapons,

357
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,670
you'll have greater power.

358
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,190
Isn't that great?

359
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,150
I want specific intel.

360
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,260
You decide

361
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,500
what deal we make.

362
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,580
I always have time for you.

363
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,340
Help me to find her.

364
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,190
Then your debt to me is over.

365
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,070
Chief,

366
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,740
Ruo Wen is fierce and savage.

367
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,710
What if he brings disaster?

368
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
In my opinion,

369
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,390
- we should have...
- He's sharp.

370
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,820
But we can use him wisely.

371
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,140
Ruo Wen has great martial arts.

372
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,340
And his men are outside the city.

373
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,570
Now, we can't get into trouble.

374
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,460
How's the Mansion guarded lately?

375
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,100
You fear he'll sneak in for Miss Beishuang?

376
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,140
Don't worry, Chief.

377
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,990
There have been more guards.

378
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,230
He can't sneak it, however hard he tries.

379
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,220
Don't let down our guard.

380
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,950
Where am I?

381
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,030
Ruo Wen?

382
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,620
Ruo Wen!

383
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,990
Come in, please.

384
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,260
Sir, come in.

385
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,390
Entertain him.

386
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,500
Sir, you haven't been here in a while.

387
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,540
The girls miss you so much.

388
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,780
Come in, please.

389
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,820
Hey, girls.

390
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,740
Be wise, all right?

391
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,740
Make all these men happy.

392
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,270
Madam.

393
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,470
What do you think of today's girl?

394
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,790
Here.

395
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,230
Where did you get her?

396
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,190
The more, the better.

397
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,180
All right.

398
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,950
Don't be fussy.

399
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,510
- Go away.
- Welcome next time.

400
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,470
Thank you, Madam.

401
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,780
Girl, you're awake?

402
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,870
Is this a brothel?

403
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,500
Clever girl.

404
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,100
This is Zuixiang Brothel,

405
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,540
the most famous brothel in Yunpei.

406
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,100
Zuixiang Brothel?

407
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,060
Yeah.

408
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,390
Good. Fancy place.

409
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,550
Isn't it?

410
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,740
What is wrong with her?

411
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,700
Never seen this before.

412
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,190
She just went up.

413
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,070
Yeah.

414
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,580
This house is built

415
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,550
upon the best restaurant
in the Central Plains.

416
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,910
A bumpkin like her
has never seen it before.

417
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,820
Hey, girl.

418
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,660
It's a fancy place, isn't it?

419
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,510
Yes, indeed.

420
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,430
I've never been in such a wonderland.

421
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,260
Then you can stay.

422
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,950
With this pretty face,

423
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,950
you can be a top girl here.

424
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,470
Top girl? Me?

425
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,870
Yes.

426
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,020
But too bad.

427
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,780
I have a man.

428
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,100
Where is he?

429
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,540
Don't think of him.

430
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,190
He has abandoned you.

431
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,820
Or why did he sell you like this?

432
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:04,990
Ruo Wen?

433
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,190
Don't let her get away!

434
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,060
Get her!

435
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,270
Hurry!

436
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,430
Run after me, huh?

437
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,620
Screw you.

438
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,100
Go get her.

439
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,390
Stop running. Get down here.

440
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,230
Go, guys!

441
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,170
Where do you want to go?

442
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,230
Hurry. Get down here.

443
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,100
Get her down. Hurry.

444
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,630
Let me go!

445
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,630
Terrible girl.

446
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,270
Let me see where you can go.

447
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,120
Don't struggle.

448
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,940
(Miss you.)

449
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,710
Mr. Zhu.

450
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,300
Oh, it's you, My Lady.

451
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,580
I wondered who was
playing the flute so late.

452
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,820
What were you playing?

453
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,870
I've never heard it before.

454
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,430
A song of Enaqi.

455
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,340
You've been away from it for some days.

456
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,060
You must be homesick.

457
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,670
Thanks for understanding.

458
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,230
But I think

459
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,950
I heard another sound

460
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,540
come from far away.

461
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,020
The flute gives a melodious sound.

462
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,470
It's sometimes near
and sometimes far away.

463
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,860
Oh, I see.

464
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,020
What brings you here so late, Mr. Zhu?

465
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,230
I nearly forgot.

466
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,980
The needlework competition is coming.

467
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,260
Only so many threads and they're precious.

468
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,190
Hope you'll make an exquisite embroidery

469
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,780
to make His Lordship happy.

470
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,830
Thank you

471
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,100
for coming so late.

472
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,190
I wouldn't dare to hold it up.

473
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,300
Get some rest early, My Lady.

474
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,510
I'll take my leave.

475
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,660
(Library)

476
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,910
What you did at the lantern show

477
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,990
was really impressive.

478
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,100
Mr. Rong,

479
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,390
I didn't do that

480
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,060
simply for you.

481
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,910
As long as my people believe it,

482
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,500
I'll be a great lord.

483
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,710
Lately, I've been sleepless.

484
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,820
In my heart,

485
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,670
something keeps bothering me.

486
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,470
You charge excessive taxes

487
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,500
and reign over thousands of soldiers.

488
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,740
I guess you'll get your retribution.

489
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,740
I'd like to know

490
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,780
what exactly

491
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,910
bothers you.

492
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,430
I guess you know what it is.

493
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,710
My instincts tell me

494
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,910
that boy is still alive.

495
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,990
I want to find him

496
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,630
and share this great city with him.

497
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,820
Are you delusional?

498
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,100
That boy

499
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,820
was killed

500
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,780
by your soldiers in red.

501
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,990
Can a dead boy

502
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,740
still scare the Lord of Yunpei?

503
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,340
What on earth are you scared of?

504
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,950
Mr. Rong,

505
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,950
you get me wrong.

506
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,990
I just want to find my brother

507
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,580
who is wandering far from home.

508
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,780
Before I find his dead body,

509
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,300
I'll keep searching for him.

510
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,620
Forever.

511
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,630
What you're doing

512
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,630
really touches me.

513
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,060
This world is so big.

514
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,950
Take your time to search for him.

Don't worry, My Lady.

544
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,060
This time,

545
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,660
we will not lose.

546
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,700
Now, His Lordship favors me.

547
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,910
But I still have to be alert.

548
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,180
I won't let her reap the benefits

549
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,270
and overwhelm me.

550
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,470
Yes, My Lady.

551
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,870
We will win the competition.

552
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,220
His Lordship is here.

553
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,180
- How do I look?
- Good.

554
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,950
My Lord,

555
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,310
there you are.

556
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,220
Lady Youjia,

557
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,830
what are you doing up this late?

558
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,790
You have no idea, My Lord.

559
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,390
Every night, Her Ladyship
stays up late for you.

560
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,060
In this case,

561
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,350
I always keep you up, huh?

562
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,470
Then,

563
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,830
I would rather not come.

564
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,660
My Lord,

565
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,990
don't say that.

566
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,580
Get some rest early.

567
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,420
Got it?

568
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,620
Oh, I forgot.

569
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,220
You prefer the herbal tea.

570
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,060
