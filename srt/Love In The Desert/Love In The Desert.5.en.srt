Plain noodles? Are they enough?

Sir, serve us with the best food and wine.

27
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,110
All right.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,360
It's been so long since I saw
such a pretty woman.

29
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,510
That's right.

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,540
Come on.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,870
Let me check it first.

32
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,840
Come on. Let's drink.

33
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,510
Can you read it?

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,390
As a princess of Masui,

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,830
you can't even read your city map.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,670
I was kept in my room.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,420
I had no time for this.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,020
In your room?

39
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,830
Then who are you here?

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,750
You know what will happen if you lie.

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Hi, there.

42
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,460
Beef noodles for you.

43
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,790
You don't behave like a princess.

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,580
You've been stalling for time.

45
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,420
Rather suspicious.

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,140
I'm just hungry, all right?

47
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,490
Besides,

48
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,670
even if I lied to you,

49
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,470
what can you do to me?

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,860
Just kidding.

51
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Don't be angry. Don't.

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,060
We share the world in northwest.

53
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,740
The desert remains

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,740
in a state of disunity.

55
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,060
Man, you're dressed up...

56
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,260
Are you one of us?

57
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,500
We don't have a family.

58
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,060
Friends in the desert unite as one.

59
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,700
In this case,

60
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,580
let's make a deal.

61
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,420
Is she the woman you got?

62
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,380
We don't rob you of money or water.

63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,060
We just haven't had a woman for days.

64
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,460
You go and leave the woman.

65
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,100
What do you say?

66
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,580
What is he talking about?

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,260
They want you.

68
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,260
Me?

69
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,140
Yeah. They outnumber me.

70
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,070
I don't have a choice.

71
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,460
But you promised me.

72
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,220
What kind of bandit would keep a promise?

73
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,660
You're so heartless.

74
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,940
Want to leave?

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,180
Young girl,

76
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,900
you look pretty.

77
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,860
Go with me.

78
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,260
Quite a character.

79
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,380
I love it.

80
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,700
Buddies, get her together.

81
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,020
Ruo Wen, you punk.

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,140
You're not a man at all.

83
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
Ruo Wen!

84
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,100
Ruo Wen?

85
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,620
You're Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers?

86
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,260
Chief.

87
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,620
Chief, we're wrong.

88
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,140
We shouldn't have fought for her.

89
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,380
Chief, we're sorry.

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,820
Please spare us.

91
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,660
Chief.

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,660
Get lost.

93
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,740
Let's go. Come on.

94
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,340
How dare you fool me?

95
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,740
I can keep my promise.

96
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,620
But don't think I'm a real fool.

97
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,900
This is a lesson you should learn.

98
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,140
If I can't get the treasure of Masui,

99
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,940
you'll suffer a hundred times more.

100
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,740
Pick something useful and go.

101
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,260
You...

102
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,540
You...

103
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,780
You want me to carry all this?

104
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,020
But I...

105
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm not strong enough.

106
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,580
I... I won't take this.

107

191
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,260
♪Turn all sorrow into infinite hope♪

192
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,600
♪I look up at the stars
and light up the night sky♪

193
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,060
(Yun)

194
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,100
(Huayu Mansion)

195
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,500
(Fengtian Pavilion)

196
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,460
At the order and with the blessing

197
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,700
of the Lord of Yunpei,

198
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,580
the ceremony will start momentarily.

199
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,140
(Fengtian Pavilion)

200
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,340
Princesses from all tribes wait here.

201
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,620
No one can get in

202
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,380
until she is summoned.

203
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,360
(At the order of the Lord of Yunpei...)

204
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,740
Princess Nakuo'er Helin
of the Nakuo'er Tribe is summoned.

205
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,020
Princess Guhe Shuyue
of the Guhe Tribe is summoned.

206
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,460
Princess Qiangxi Meng
of the Qiangxi Tribe is summoned.

207
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,660
Princess Shanle Pingqiao
of the Shanle Tribe is summoned.

208
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,980
Princess Loukangnan Feng
of the Loukangnan Tribe is summoned.

209
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,980
(Fengtian Pavilion)

210
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,260
Princess Zhenqu Youjia
of the Zhenqu Tribe is summoned.

211
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,900
I'm Zhenqu Youjia.

212
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,740
Greetings, My Lord.

213
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,980
May Yunpei prosper
and reign over the desert.

214
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,380
Get up and talk.

215
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,420
(Princess of Zhenqu)

216
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,900
(Zhenqu Youjia)
I have come here

217
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,660
with the treasure of my tribe,

218
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,980
Glazed Jade Cup.

219
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,220
And three boxes of jewels and fancy wine.

220
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,660
Please accept them, My Lord.

221
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,220
What is that?

222
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Quite a nice painting.

223
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,460
But why does this man
stand with his back to us?

224
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,260
Let me explain this.

225
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,980
Please don't blame me.

226
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,500
Go ahead.

227
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,380
This is what happened in my dream.

228
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,980
I once dreamed that Your Lordship
dominated over the desert,

229
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,780
but I only saw you from behind.

230
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,180
I'm afraid

231
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,300
I had a dream that I shouldn't have.

232
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,180
After I woke up,

233
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,940
I thought about it

234
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,140
and had a painter paint it out.

235
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,540
When you dominate over the desert,

236
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,300
I can give it to you personally.

237
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,020
It's very nice of you.

238
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,660
Why do you sound so humble?

239
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,860
I'm here to serve you, My Lord.

240
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,940
Since I arrived in Yunpei,

241
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,500
I've no longer been what I used to be.

242
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,740
Now,

243
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,100
I'll wait until you title me.

244
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,580
Good.

245
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,540
Leave us.

246
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,740
Is there anyone else I have to see?

247
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,940
Princess of Mizan Tribe.

248
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,740
The last one?

249
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,180
Yes.

250
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,380
Get her in.

251
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,340
I'm tired.

252
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,020
Princess Mizan Yuwei
of the Mizan Tribe is summoned.

253
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,460
Sir, please wait.

254
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,580
Who are you?

255
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,020
You're late.

256
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,220
The ceremony is over.

257
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,420
- You go back.
- Sir.

258
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,260
I'm Huang Beishuang from Enaqi.

259
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,340
I came all the way from the north desert.

260
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,700
We traveled day and night
just to see His Lordship.

261
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,260
Please kindly help me.

262
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,780
It's not that I don't help you.

263
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,860
But His Lordship will see no one.

264
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,300
As for you...

265
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,940
Go back to where you came from.

266
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,460
It took us so much trouble to come here.

267
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,740
Why can't you just tell His Lordship?

268
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,460
What do you think you are?

269
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,180
How dare you disobey His Lordship?

270
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,780
His Lordship means what he says.

271
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,020
Who dares to disobey him?

272
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,940
I don't care how far

273
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,260
you have traveled.

274
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,780
Just get out of here.

275
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,660
If you make trouble,

276
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,940
you may get killed.

277
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,780
Sir,

278
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,500
Enaqi is very far away.

279
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,300
In the past century, we have
never been summoned.

280
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,980
Now, by His Lordship's grace,

281
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
we received a marriage pass.

282
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,300
As the princess of Enaqi,

283
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,540
I started my journey
with the determination to die.

284
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
If I didn't make it here,
it would be my luck.

285
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,260
But I made it here,

286
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,140
so I was blessed by His Lordship.

287
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,340
Now, if I can't see him,

288
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,940
I have to kill myself right here.

289
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,300
But before I do that,

290
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,780
please allow me to call out
the name of His Lordship.

291
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,140
I can't see him.

292
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,100
But if he can hear my voice,

293
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,140
I'll die with nothing to regret.

294
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,340
Get up. Get up.

295
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,460
Don't threaten me like this.

296
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,940
What if you ruin the ceremony?

297
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,140
Such bad luck.

298
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,780
When I can't see His Lordship,

299
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,980
good luck or bad luck

300
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,380
will mean nothing

301
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,780
to me.

302
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,540
I don't mean you have bad luck.

303
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,740
I don't want you
to bring bad luck to His Lordship.

304
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,380
- Don't move.
- Put it down. Don't.

305
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,260
Then I'd be very guilty.

306
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Don't.

307
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,900
Come on. You...

308
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,020
Fine, fine.

309
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,060
I'll report to His Lordship.

310
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,260
Let's see if he will see you.

311
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,700
Thank you so much.

312
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,780
Now, I have nothing with me.

313
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,020
But you have my word.

314
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,940
I'll make it worth your while.

315
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,820
All right.

316
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,660
You just wait here.

317
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,860
Stay and don't do anything.

318
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,700
Don't scare me.

319
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,860
Oh, my heart hurts.

320
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,180
So much for today.

321
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,020
My Lord.

322
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,620
What?

323
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,700
Princess Huang Beishuang of Enaqi
in the north desert asked to see you.

324
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,660
The north desert?

325
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,220
Thousands of miles away.

326
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,900
In the past century, no one from Enaqi

327
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,060
has ever come here.

328
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,620
What took her so long?

329
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,140
My Lord,

330
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,940
she is out there.

331
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,300
If you don't see her,

332
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,060
I'll send her away.

333
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,180
The north desert.

334
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,460
Over the century, she's the first lady

335
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,980
who has come from the north desert.

336
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,740
Fine. Get her in.

337
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,900
Yes.

338
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,820
Princess Huang Beishuang
of Enaqi is summoned.

339
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,140
So, you are Huang Beishuang?

340
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,100
Yes. Greetings, My Lord.

341
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,420
May Yunpei

342
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,100
always be admired
and dominate over the desert.

343
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,900
What's that in your hand?

344
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,940
Soil?

345
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,580
To be honest, My Lord,

346
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,580
I came all the way here

347
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,140
and ran into some bandits.

348
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,100
Nearly all my escorts died.

349
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,020
Only the three of us survived.

350
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,020
Our offerings were taken away, too.

351
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,540
In the purse

352
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,620
is the soil of Enaqi
I got when I left it.

353
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,300
I present it to you, My Lord.

354
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,220
It means I give you my hometown

355
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,860
and present our loyalty

356
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,180
and submission to you.

357
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,700
I get what you mean.

358
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,420
But like you said,

359
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,820
you traveled all the away
at the risk of your life

360
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,940
to have come here.

361
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,740
If I don't marry you,

362
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
what will you do?

363
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,340
If you don't marry me,

364
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,780
it means my tribe isn't lucky enough

365
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,020
to serve Your Lordship.

366
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,940
But don't worry, My Lord.

367
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,580
We'll always keep in mind

368
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,540
the grace from you.

369
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,820
We'll be always loyal and never betray you.

370
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,900
Good point.

371
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,620
Very good.

372
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,460
I can get you a husband.

373
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,300
What do you say?

374
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,100
I appreciate it, My Lord.

375
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,140
If I'm not lucky enough to marry you,

376
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,860
I have vowed

377
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,220
that I'd be single all my life.

378
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,100
Please let me be.

379
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,860
It's embarrassing, then.

380
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,460
If I marry you...

381
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,140
I don't like you that much.

382
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,700
If I don't marry you...

383
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,700
You said

384
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,380
you came from far away.

385
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,780
It was really hard.

386
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,660
So a hard choice to make.

387
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,460
You care for me, My Lord.

388
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,860
I really appreciate it.

389
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,660
I have another present for you.

390
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,140
Please accept it.

391
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,740
What is it?

392
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,940
A dance I've been practicing.

393
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,340
Do you know in Yunpei,

394
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,380
there are many great dancers?

395
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,100
What if you teach fish to swim

396
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,140
and be the laughingstock?

397
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,100
Even in this case,

398
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,140
I'll make Your Lordship

399
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,740
and these officials laugh.

400
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,260
It is indeed my honor.

401
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,060
Go ahead, then.

402
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,300
Marvelous.

403
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,420
Is that "Phoenix Nirvana"?

404
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,220
So, your dress was immersed in flint powder.

405
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,640
You're knowledgeable, My Lord.

406
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,820
When the phantom dress is burned,
the new dress appears.

407
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,850
It is "Reborn from Fire".
