- Come on.

Let's check it out.

45
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,180
- Chief.
- Chief.

46
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,830
- What are you looking at?
- Just for fun.

47
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,830
Let us see, Chief.

48
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,670
Get lost, all of you.

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,950
Just one look.

50
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,790
Yeah.

51
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,750
Get lost.

52
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,820
Let me sober you up.

53
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,820
Strong, indeed.

54
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,590
Feel terrible, huh?

55
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,110
What do we do?

56
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,180
Let me help you.

57
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,870
I'll help you

58
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,460
to calm down.

59
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,350
You actually stir me up.

60
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,670
Under such circumstances,

61
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,060
you look pretty.

62
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,500
You look handsome, too.

63
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,220
You're awake?

64
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,300
Last night, you had a fever

65
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,140
and tortured yourself.

66
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,060
Can't hold on, huh?

67
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,500
Luckily, your fever is gone.

68
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,470
Last night,

69
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,550
what happened to me?

70
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,780
You sank into the lake.

71
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,340
You saved me again.

72
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,430
I just got you out of the lake.

73
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,910
Thank you for last night.

74
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,900
It's nothing.

75
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,350
For the water you gave my horse.

76
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,620
I'm Huang Beishuang.

77
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,140
Anyway, I won't owe you.

78
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,710
I always return the favor.

79
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,540
You take revenge, too.

80
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,700
Let's go.

81
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,310
Where are we going?

82
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,580
Wherever you want to go,

83
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,220
I'll send you there.

84
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,070
Yunpei or Enaqi.

85
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,860
Anywhere you want.

86
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,620
No need.

87
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,110
This is where we part.

88
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,980
Where are you going?

89
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,740
I can't leave my clansmen there.

90
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,670
This is yours.

91
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,860
I picked it up in the mess.

92
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,990
Since you want to save them,

93
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,340
how about we make a deal?

94
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,220
What deal?

95
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,580
I help you save them

96
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,340
and you give me this book.

97
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,700
Deal.

98
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,620
You have some skills.

99
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,140
You cooperated, too.

100
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,860
If I hadn't had the sap,

101
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,790
I wouldn't have slept with you.

102
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,710
You're my first man.

103
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,710
Lucky you.

104
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,140
This is a reward mark for you.

105
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,790
Remember.

106
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,260
Last night, you didn't have me.

107
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,950
I had you instead.

108
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,660
From this day on,

109
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,080
you're my man.

110
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,210
Crazy woman.

111
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,070
You're really daring.

112
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,540
I'm Ge Xinwei.

113
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Let me say it again.

114
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,950
From now on, you're my man.

115
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,020
It looks good.

116
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,620
Is it for me?

117
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,670
You wish.

118
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,380
Just a simple hairpin.

119
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,270
Don't be impatient.

120
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,260
What? Who gave it to you?

121
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,700
Someone you love?

122
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,620
In this case,

123
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,990
why didn't you have her?

124
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,400
Shut up.

125
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,480
So, you failed to get her.

126
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,260
Didn't dare? She rejected you?

127
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,030
If you keep talking,

128
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,540
I'll silence you forever.

129
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,380
Calm down. So, I'm right.

130
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,650
A pretty girl isn't interested in you.

131
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,550
Nonsense.

132
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,990
If she hadn't run away,

133
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,190
you wouldn't have had me.

134
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,310
So, she ran away.

135
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,470
(She ran away.)

136
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,620
(So, she'll get helpers to save my clansmen.)

137
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,380
(Oh, no.)

138
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,660
(I must lure Ruo Wen away.)

139
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,860
(Then she can move smoothly.)

140
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,900
Since you're my man,

141
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,310
I should give you something.

142
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,260
I don't care.

143
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,190
I'm the Ninth Princess of Masui.

144
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,540
If you have your men

145
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,780
send me back to Masui,

146
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,230
I'll get you into the Lord's Tomb.

147
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,500
There is endless treasure.

148
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,540
You... A princess?

149
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,470
Give me the treasure?

150
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,500
Instead of keeping it in the dust,

151
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,830
why don't we take it out and share it?

152
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,260
We're a family, after all.

153
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,540
If you truly mean it,

154
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,950
my men will be at your disposal.

155
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,830
I'll wait for you here.

156
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,260
If you don't want my dowry,

157
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,500
never mind.

158
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,350
You're opening your home to a bad guy.

159
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,830
What if one day,

160
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,660
I take over your city?

161
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,830
Whatever.

162
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,310
Even in that case, it's still my home.

163
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,310
Stay close.

164
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,550
Stop.

165
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,430
Who are you?

166
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,540
We're Mr. Dong's friends.

167
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,470
We're here to give him a present.

168
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,580
Friends?

169
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,310
Why do I not know

170
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,350
I have some friends like you?

171
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,350
They said they'd give you a present.

172
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,470
Present?

173
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,710
That's good.

174
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,070
So, is this the present?

175
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,550
Mr. Dong,

176
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,230
can we talk alone?

177
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,030
Talk alone?

178
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,860
That's good.

179
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,900
Keep the woman and kill the man.

180
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,780
- Chief.
- Stay still.

181
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,030
(Boa Agent?)

182
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,430
Can we talk now?

183
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,740
Yes, yes.

184
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,430
Let's just talk.

185
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,030
Chief,

186
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,710
did this crazy woman fool us?

187
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,950
Besides, we live in nature

188
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,030
and don't lack food.

189
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,020
You have no idea, boy.

190
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,540
Want to stay here forever?

191
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,990
Chief, instead of being bandits,

192
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,100
what else can we do?

193
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,860
When I'm away, be wise.

194
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,470
Watch those guys closely.

195
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,790
Rest assured, Chief.

196
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,830
Let's go.

197
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,030
Are they not going?

198
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,980
Don't overthink.

199
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,500
My point is...

200
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,710
What if you can't

201
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,230
fight Masui soldiers?

202
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,780
Isn't that your hometown?

203
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
Do I need to fight?

204
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,970
Of course.

205
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,470
What if people find us?

206
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,070
I can take care of that alone.

207
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,070
Let's go.

208
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,030
Fox,

209
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,830
do you think

210
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,860
this woman fooled Chief?

211
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,860
Chief is going there

212
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,110
to check the terrain of Masui

213
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,260
and get us a new home.

214
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,700
Masui?

215
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,150
Good place.

216
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,910
What do we do with them?

217
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,190
According to Chief,

218
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,070
their princess

219
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,660
may come back to save them.

220
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,830
He asked us to be careful.

221
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,950
Let's lure them in

222
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,830
and let them die here.

223
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,230
Think about it. When that woman returns

224
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,140
and sees her clansmen dead,

225
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
will she be scared?

226
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,900
No. She's not coming back.

227
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,500
The explosives have been planted.

228
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,830
Ruo Wen is away.

229
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,430
He is?

230
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,260
It's much better. Trust me.

231
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,620
Take this.

232
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,380
Just in case.

233
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,500
Listen. See the signal and ignite it.

234
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,710
Who are you? Stop.

235
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,100
Somebody.

236
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,340
Let's go.

237
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,620
(The Dead Zone)

238
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,470
Who are you?

239
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,750
Come and look.

240
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,950
Look who this is. Oh, Mr. Dong.

241
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,870
Long time no see.

242
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,100
What are you doing here?

243
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,710
Mr. Dong, have a death wish, huh?

244
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,230
Gentlemen,

245
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,500
I'm Mr. Dong's deputy.

246
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,580
He has the desert hallucination.

247
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,430
He's too hoarse to talk.

248
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,710
He has made me the Chief.

249
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,540
Life is hard for us.

250
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,060
I know this is one of the best places

251
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,500
in the desert.

252
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,500
See? I took my men here

253
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,190
for a better future.

254
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,650
For shelter?

255
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,110
Then you should do something, huh?

256
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,270
Otherwise,

257
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,500
I can't explain it to Chief.

258
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,190
Don't worry, Mr. Fox.

259
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,550
We've brought a present.

260
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,630
Nice present, indeed.

261
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,030
Chief will love it.

262
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,260
How did you catch her?

263
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,500
What exactly

264
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,990
are you up to?

265
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,470
Mr. Fox,

266
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,100
we don't dare to do any trickery.

267
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,870
Here we are, in front of you.

268
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,150
You decide if we live.

269
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,230
Mr. Fox,

270
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,470
if you don't want this woman,

271
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,870
I'll take her.

272
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,820
Be my woman, huh?

273
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,780
I'm going to kill you.

274
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,620
Stop.

275
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,780
Mr. Dong, your man is really unruly.

276
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,540
To tell you the truth,

277
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,230
I don't call the shots.

278
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,470
Chief Ruo Wen does.

279
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,230
But if you kill someone first,

280
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,630
I may put in a good word

281
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,630
with Chief Ruo Wen.

282
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,470
Who do you want me to kill?

283
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,340
Her.

284
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,870
That's easy. Wait and see.

285
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,230
No, no. Don't.

286
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,270
No.

287
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,630
Get out of my way.

288
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,470
Duozai.

289
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,900
Duozai.

290
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,310
Duozai!

291
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,270
Stop right here.

292
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,340
You killed my clansmen.

293
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,740
You'll die!

294
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,030
Don't be so impatient.

295
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,470
I'll have you now.

296
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,740
Let's enjoy some food and wine.

297
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,670
Ignore her.

298
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,620
Come on.

299
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,500
- Let's go.
- Come on.

300
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,750
Let's drink.

301
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,230
You'll be my friend.

302
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,070
All right.

303
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,620
Get in there.

304
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,660
Behave yourself.

305
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,990
Your Grace.

306
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,380
Your Grace.

307
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,470
Where are the others?

308
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,990
They're dead.

309
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,540
Follow me closely.

310
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,790
I'll take you out.

311
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,470
Guys, come on.

312
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,500
Let's eat and drink.

313
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,560
Cheers.

314
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,410
Bottoms up.

315
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,870
- All right.
- Cheers.

316
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,270
Fill your cups.

317
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,170
- Drink.
- Come on.

318
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,540
All right. Now, we're a family.

319
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,300
Mr. Fox, Mr. Wolf.

320
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,740
Let's drink.

321
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,140
Come on.

322
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,230
Let me fill your cup.

323
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,570
Here's the wine.

324
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,620
Let's drink.

325
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,060
Chief, he's one of them.

326
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,630
Your Grace, run.

327
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,660
Catch them.

328
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,710
Don't run.

329
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,030
Stop!

330
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,230
Stop!

331
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,870
- Forget about me. Just run.
- Duozai.

332
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,230
How can I forget about you?

333
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,740
Madam Duozai, run.

334
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,750
Hurry!

335
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,140
Hold on tightly.

336
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,260
Don't let them get away.

337
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,270
Come on.

338
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,230
Run, Duozai.

339
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,070
The rest of you, catch up!

340
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,940
After them!

341
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,100
Get on the horse. Hurry.

342
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,950
- Catch them.
- Run.

343
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,060
- After them!
- Stop!

344
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,230
Archers.

345
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,260
- Shoot!
- Yes.

346
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,660
Fall back.

347
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,340
(I wonder if she's got helpers.)

348
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,990
We went in circles for three laps.

349
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,820
Do you or do you not know the way?

350
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,790
I'm tired.

351
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,670
Mad woman, playing a trick, huh?

352
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,470
What trick am I playing?

353
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,630
How can a princess not know the way home?

354
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,540
I don't know where I am.

355
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,950
Unless you send me back
to where I was kidnapped.

356
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,670
Or how can I know where to go?

357
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,580
Then why did you give confusing advice?

358
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,340
All the paths here look the same.

359
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,510
If you didn't tell me,

360
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,720
I wouldn't know we were going in circles.

361
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,950
Since we're held up,

362
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,230
how about we take some rest?

363
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,510
I warn you.

364
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,060
Keep your eyes wide open.

365
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,870
If you go the wrong way again,
I will dig them out.

366
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,020
It's just a few minutes.

367
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,550
Ruo Wen.

368
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,380
Ruo Wen!

369
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,300
Duozai, hang in there.

370
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,150
I won't let you die.

371
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,150
I just won't let you die.

372
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,390
You're going to Yunpei with me.

373
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,150
I'll wrap you now.

374
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,740
No need. I'm dying.

375
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,510
No, Duozai.

376
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,430
You promised to go to Yunpei with me.

377
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,820
Without you,

378
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,470
I would have lost my nerve.

379
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,320
You promised me

380
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,100
you'd always be with me.

381
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,150
Good girl.

382
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,470
Listen to me.

383
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,440
Everything comes to an end.

384
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,200
Sadness.

385
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,890
Happiness.

386
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,360
Poverty.

387
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,820
And wealth.

388
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,300
But desire and wisdom just don't.

389
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,340
Good girl, remember.

390
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,150
Take back everything with wisdom.

391
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,500
But don't be overwhelmed by desire.

392
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,740
Kid,

393
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,990
please allow me

394
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,340
to call you Ninth Princess again.

395
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,830
Duozai.

396
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,190
Your Grace...

397
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,420
Duozai.

398
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,630
I...

399
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,150
I can no longer keep you company.

400
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,990
I'm going to see your mother

401
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,430
and go back to Enaqi with her.

402
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,020
I'm going back home.

403
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,630
Duozai.

404
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,910
Kid,

405
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,870
can you play

406
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,900
the Song of Enaqi

407
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,820
- I once taught you?
- Sure.

408
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,070
Sure.

409
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,950
Duozai.

410
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,230
Have some water.

411
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
Thank you.

412
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,060
The world is dangerous.

413
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,710
The desert is merciless.

414
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,990
Even if you don't want her to die,

415
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,390
you should let her be.

416
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
This is what you told me.

417
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,430
I'm just thinking.

418
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,500
This woman

419
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,740
devoted all her life

420
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,720
to her masters and clansmen.

421
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,260
I'm also a woman in the desert.

422
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,500
What is my destiny, then?

423
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,420
Have you figured it out?

424
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,470
Destiny can never be figured out.

425
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,470
My current destiny

426
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,150
is to get to Yunpei.

427
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,390
Then, you'll yield to destiny.

428
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,100
Just a friendly reminder.

429
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,580
I know future is uncertain

430
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,060
and destiny is fierce.

431
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,060
But I don't have a choice.

432
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,500
All I can do

433
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,950
is to be pushed forward.

434
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,740
Yepei, Lianhuan.

435
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,890
Your Grace.

436
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,510
Your Grace.

437
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,390
I came with many people.

438
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,390
Now, only the two of you survived.

439
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,510
You can leave.

440
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,340
Future is uncertain.

441
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,190
I can go to Yunpei alone.

442
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,150
On the day we left Enaqi,

443
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,820
we solemnly vowed.

444
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,870
However hard the journey was,

445
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,740
we would keep going.

446
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,230
Your Grace, for Enaqi,

447
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,230
you'd sacrifice yourself.

448
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,470
We'll protect it with you.

449
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,950
He is right.

450
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,470
Wherever you go, we will go.

451
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,310
Fine.

452
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,540
Then, let's face it together.

453
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,910
Where did you get the new clothes?

454
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,950
I asked Dong Bahe for some rewards.

455
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,870
You saved us.

456
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,470
We will always remember that.

457
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,580
I promised to give you this.

458
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,550
This is where I leave you.

459
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,870
Wish you all the best.

460
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,220
Wait, Mr. Huo.

461
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,340
One more thing.

462
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,960
Escort us to Yunpei.

463
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,470
Now, you trust me?

464
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,470
We exploded Ruo Wen's den.

465
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,020
They won't let us go.

466
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,060
I need to reach Yunpei safely.

467
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,430
What else can you trade with me?

468
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
The trip was tough.

469
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,830
I no longer have

470
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,950
anything valuable with me.

471
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,940
How about this?

472
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,740
You make a promise to me

473
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,030
and fulfill it later.

474
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,270
No problem.

475
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,230
Get me to Yunpei within three days.

476
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,820
I will keep my promise.

477
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:15,990
Feita will make it within two days.

478
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,510
Let's go.

479
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,710
Your Grace.

480
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,860
Sit down here.

481
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,870
She was poisoned before.

482
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,710
And she was overcome by grief.

483
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,940
Now, she's very weak.

484
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,990
She can't hurry on with the journey.

485
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,820
Why don't we rest before setting out?

486
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,230
No.

487
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,430
The ceremony is coming.

488
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,910
I have to reach Yunpei before that.

489
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:48,850
How about this?

490
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,950
The two of you rush to Yunpei

491
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,190
and hand over the pass.

492
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,390
She and I will arrive the next day.

493
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,070
But...

494
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,190
It must not be delayed.

495
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,140
Yes.

496
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,070
Yes.

497
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,990
Thank you, Mr. Huo.

498
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,950
It's a song of Enaqi, right?

499
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,070
What is it about?

500
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,500
Love and departure.

501
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,820
It's about lovesickness.

502
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,340
Enaqi.

503
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,910
What kind of place is your hometown?

504
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,880
Life there is poor and hard.

505
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,710
But people struggle tremulously

506
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,020
to survive.

507
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,130
To live,

508
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,920
we have to rely on stronger tribes.

509
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,670
Nothing is special.

510
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,250
It's just a normal tribe

511
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,950
in the merciless desert.

512
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,700
I always have some confusion.

513
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,870
Why do you have to travel

514
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,060
all the way for an uncertain future?

515
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,950
Maybe marriage doesn't suit you.

516
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,150
Mr. Huo, you saved me.

517
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,580
But it doesn't mean

518
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,540
you can comment on my business.

519
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,430
Just saying.

520
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,150
There are more cities in the desert.

521
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,260
Why must you go to Yunpei?

522
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,990
The other two cities don't want me.

523
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,230
Why?

524
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,950
With traitors, Masui has failed.

525
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,780
It can't even survive.

526
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,190
How can it protect my tribe?

527
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,860
What about Tiandu?

528
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,270
Tiandu.

529
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,340
It's not good enough for me.

530
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,300
What happened?

531
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,070
As far as I know,

532
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,670
Tiandu has been closed for years.

533
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,630
It can't be against Enaqi.

534
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,940
Get on the horse.

535
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,150
Or when can we reach Yunpei?

536
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,620
Feeling any better?

537
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,870
The wind blows and the sand moves.

538
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,020
The vast desert

539
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,580
makes me forget myself.

540
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,740
Hope you won't be unhappy

541
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,580
with what I said.

542
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,340
I know you mean well.

543
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,340
There's no way to heaven.

544
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,870
But people keep trying.

545
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,310
I'm just finding a way

546
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,470
to the upper class of Yunpei.

547
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,900
Turn left.

548
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,340
- Why?
- Just listen to me.

549
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,870
They're right around here.

550
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,310
They're up ahead.

551
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,790
Hurry.

552
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,390
How do you know this forest?

553
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,540
I observed the terrain.

554
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,990
There must have been a riverbed.

555
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,580
Along a riverbed

556
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,470
is where plants grow.

557
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,580
But you...

558
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,340
How do you know this pit?

559
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,420
I guessed.

560
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,580
Big caravans

561
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,310
usually make camp.

562
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,750
But businessmen who travel alone

563
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,430
usually find a pit in this kind of forest

564
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,310
to hide from beasts.

565
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,500
You know so well about the desert.

566
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,500
So do you.

567
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,590
Where are they?

568
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,350
I just saw them here.

569
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,140
- Search carefully.
- Yes.

570
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:32,750
Let's go.

571
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,700
