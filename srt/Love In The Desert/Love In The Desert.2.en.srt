00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,180
(Enaqi has the Desert Scroll.)

25
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,100
(Instead of letting Na Zhan have it,)

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,540
(why don't I...?)

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,460
Old pal,

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,700
they saved us.

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,980
If we do this,

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,740
will we be ungrateful?

31
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,020
Yan'er, I want to drink that.

32
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,980
Get it to me.

33
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,880
Look.

34
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,700
Guo'er.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,860
My quilt was torn when I moved it.

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,580
Please help me mend it.

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Yes, Your Grace.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,660
Give me some more.

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
A little bit more, please.

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,060
You're bleeding.

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,940
It's all right. Thanks for your concern.

42
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,780
There's powder in my camp.

43
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,340
Come get some.

44
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,820
Actually, my caravan

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,940
also planned to go to Yunpei.

46
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,260
What do you sell?

47
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,780
Fur, cloth, spices, and ore.

48
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,300
What spices?

49
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,900
Sandal and agarwood.

50
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,180
Where are they from?

51
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,580
The Central Plains.

52
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,180
Which of the spices

53
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,620
is more expensive?

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,860
Sandal, of course.

55
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,380
You were robbed.

56
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,220
You must have lost a lot.

57
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
I'm just an escort.

58
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,060
I survived,

59
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,780
but the goods were lost.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,500
I think I need a new job.

61
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,020
Drink.

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,740
Six. Double six and seven. Seven of eight.

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,580
Six.

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,980
- Drink it.
- All right.

65
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,500
- I'll drink.
- Go ahead.

66
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,780
Wrap it yourself.

67
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,380
Come on.

68
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,100
Cheers.

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,900
Lianhuan.

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,940
Yes, Your Grace?

71
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,500
What are you doing?

72
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,260
Playing and drinking.

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,420
I'll dismiss them.

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,060
No need.

75
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,700
We had a long trip.

76
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,540
They can relax.

77
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,780
Ask them to sleep early.

78
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,700
Tomorrow morning, we'll move on.

79
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,020
All right.

80
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,140
Lianhuan.

81
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,860
The weather is strange.

82
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Be very careful.

83
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,580
Come on. Let's drink.

84
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,140
What are you looking for?

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,700
The bandage ran out.

86
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,740
Sorry. I shouldn't have searched it.

87
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,260
Can... Can you help me?

88
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,300
Thank you.

89
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,020
(He's really up to something.)

90
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,140
Mr. Huo.

91
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,940
Tonight, rest without concern.

92
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,940
But sorry, we have

93
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,260
limited food and water.

94
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,900
We can't keep you for long.

95
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,700
I get it.

96
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,420
Thanks for saving me.

97
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,740
Tomorrow morning, I'll leave.

98
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,560
Hit you.

99
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,420
What are you doing?

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,350
Be gentle.

101
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,260
One more time.

102
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,170
Come on. One more time.

103
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,220
Duozai, stop it.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Your eyes are weak. Don't get pricked.

105
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,660
Unless mended, the hole will get bigger.

106
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,540
Then, it can't be mended.

107
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,460
It makes sense.

108
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,820
Guo'er.

109
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,940
Go get the windsock.

110
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,020
All right.

111
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,180
Madam Duozai,

112
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,140
Your Grace asked you to get the windsock.

113
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,780
Guo'er.

114
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,700
Go plug the windsock on the high dune.

115
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,700
All right.

116
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,340
Madam Duozai.

117
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,500
Get up, all of you!

118
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
What's wrong?

119
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,820
How long?

120
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,460
How long have you been bullying Duozai?

121
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,460
Forget it.

122
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,980
Who started this?

123
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,780
I'm asking one last time.

124
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,060
It started on the day we set out.

125
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Guo'er started this.

126
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,020
Is that true?

127
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,460
Guo'er, you stand there.

128
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,300
The rest of you can sit down.

129
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,620
If you're tired,

130
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,060
you can go back and sleep.

131
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,300
Kneel!

132
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,500
Your Grace, you're noble.

133
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,100
Even if you willingly marry the Lord,

134
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,900
you have dignity.

135
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,540
But what about us?

136
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,580
We're slaves.

137
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,740
We keep you company

138
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,100
to find a way out for Enaqi.

139
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,180
The trip to Yunpei is dangerous.

140
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,260
I just want to know

141
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,380
how it feels to be served.

142
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,860
What is wrong with that?

143
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,260
Look!

144
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,060
This is the hand of an old lady.

145
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,780
She raised five sons and three daughters.

146
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,860
Now, she is skinny.

147
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,540
What is she doing here?

148
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,300
Going where there's no turning back.

149
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,340
We all had physical and mental suffering

150
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,460
and faced a difficult choice

151
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,300
before starting this dangerous trip.

152
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,700
Don't forget.

153
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,180
We travel all the way for Enaqi!

154
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,540
You can't stand the pain
or resist the temptation.

155
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,620
You want to be served.

156
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Then you bully an old lady.

157
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,100
Don't you fear you'll get retribution?

158
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,020
This is a dangerous trip.

159
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,460
Unless we unite as one,

160
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,300
we can't get to Yunpei.

161
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,580
Manmade trouble can get us killed here.

162
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,100
Within today,

163
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,740
anyone who wants to leave can go.

164
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,980
So can the guards.

165
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,820
Just forget you're from Enaqi!

166
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,620
I will not complain.

167
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,940
After today,

168
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,860
those who stay

169
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,900
will go to Yunpei with me.

170
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,460
After that,

171
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,940
we'll leave our lives to fate.

172
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,860
Chief.

173
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,710
Speak.

174
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,180
The pretty's convoy travels slowly.

175
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,060
We'll catch up in half a day.

176
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,020
Got it. Sit down and drink.

177
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Drink.

178
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,220
Take it away.

179
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,980
We're ready to go.

180
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,860
Yes.

181
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,700
Catch up.

182
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,700
- All right.
- Coming.

183
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,340
Your Grace,

184
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,260
are you wary of this guy?

185
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,260
He claims to be an escort.

186
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,620
Yesterday, I tested him.

187
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,860
He knows the price and origin of the goods.

188
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,180
But his robe is rather expensive.

189
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
I guess he lied about something.

190
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,740
- Shall I...?
- Don't kill him.

191
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,300
Let's just be cautious.

192
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,740
But when we set out,

193
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,100
we will wake him up.

194
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,260
It's all right.

195
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,260
He won't wake up very soon.

196
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,420
Old pal, this woman isn't simple.

197
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,540
If we keep pursuing her,

198
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,900
I'm afraid she'll suspect more.

199
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,820
Maybe another time.

200
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,420
Good drug, indeed.

201
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,140
Just a waste of water.

202
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,180
- Fox.
- Guys,

203
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,340
all the offerings and money.

204
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,740
Take whatever you want.

205
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,780
Your Grace.

206
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,700
If anyone resists, kill him!

207
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,100
Your Grace, you can't go out.

208
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,420
Your Grace.

209
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,060
Protect Her Grace.

210
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,420
Or shall I wait until they break in?

211
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,020
Stop, all of you.

212
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,460
Drop your weapons and do not resist.

213
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,460
Gentlemen,

214
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,220
we are not your enemies.

215
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,060
We're just passing by.

216
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,580
We don't want to lose our lives here.

217
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,460
Jewelry, water, wine,
and food are in the carriages.

218
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,180
We'll give you everything.

219
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,100
Just spare our lives.

220
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,340
In some twisted turn,

221
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,580
we will certainly

222
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,500
repay you.

223
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,300
In the past dozen years
throughout the desert,

224
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,940
I've never seen a prey

225
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,380
stand out and negotiate with me.

226
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,220
Not to mention you're a woman.

227
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,900
Pretty,

228
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,860
you have to know.

229
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,340
Since you surrendered,

230
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,580
you've been in my back pocket.

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,380
Don't negotiate

232
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,700
with my own stuff.

233
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,180
How dare you!

234
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,060
Lianhuan.

235
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,220
Tell me your name.

236
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm just one of the convoys to Yunpei.

237
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,580
My name is nothing.

238
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,700
These offerings

239
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,420
were collected by our tribe

240
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,900
for entirely five years.

241
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,620
It's the thorn in our flesh

242
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,540
and the blade that scrapes us.

243
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,660
Now,

244
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,500
we will give you everything.

245
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,540
Please spare our lives.

246
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,060
Na Zhan will not get anything.

247
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,220
Chief,

248
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,780
we can't abandon

249
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,380
the miserable land
where we were born and raised.

250
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,980
Nor can we abandon

251
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,660
our family back there.

252
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,860
Now, they're worried.

253
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,940
If we can't make it to Yunpei in time,

254
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,220
what awaits them

255
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,020
will be a catastrophe.

256
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,940
Why do you laugh?

257
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,580
Do you not have parents?

258
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,060
Do you not have any goodness?

259
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,900
Guys,

260
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,660
where are our parents?

261
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,340
No parents raised us!

262
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,860
Where are our family?

263
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,620
Either eloped or ran away!

264
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,540
Guys,

265
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,860
if you want money, get some money!

266
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,660
If you want a woman, get a woman!

267
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,300
- Guys, come down.
- All right.

268
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,900
- Let's go.
- Come on.

269
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,780
I, Ruo Wen, am not affiliated with any city.

270
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,580
There's no room for me in this world.

271
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,420
Nor do I care about anything.

272
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,140
Old pal,

273
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,100
such a great chance.

274
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,580
(The Dead Zone)

275
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,140
(Ruo Wen is brutal.)

276
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,300
(But he's good at observing the terrain.)

277
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
(He encamps in the Dead Zone)

278
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,780
(with little quicksand and few storms.)

279
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,380
(When they rob people)

280
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,300
(for daily life,)

281
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,180
(the Dead Zone)

282
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,740
(without water or animals)

283
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,780
(can be the best campsite.)

284
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,180
Guys, divide up everything.

285
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,960
Great.

286
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,220
Lianhuan,

287
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,820
ask everybody to stay alive.

288
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,340
Do not struggle for nothing.

289
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,660
Only when we're alive

290
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,180
can we try to get out.

291
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,420
Yes.

292
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,620
You, you, and you.

293
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,540
You guys come with me.

294
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,740
Hurry.

295
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,380
Your Grace, take care.

296
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,820
What is this?

297
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,900
We're done sorting.

298
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,140
Go report to Mr. Wolf.

299
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,900
- Bring back some wine and meat.
- All right.

300
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,860
I'll be waiting.

301
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,100
(Herb Volume of the Desert Scroll)

302
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,500
The woman Chief brought back

303
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,980
is really pretty.

304
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,980
After he has a good time,

305
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,140
can we also have her?

306
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,740
Stop daydreaming.

307
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,020
Just thinking.

308
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,060
I want to see Ruo Wen.

309
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,420
I want to see him.

310
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,420
You can't see him just as you wish.

311
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,860
Stop yelling.

312
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,100
Or I'll pull your tongue out.

313
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,260
Get them in.

314
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,260
Hurry.

315
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,140
Behave yourselves.

316
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,580
Then you may live for several more days.

317
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,700
Guys, let's go have a drink.

318
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,580
Let's go.

319
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,230
- Your...
- Shh.

320
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,860
Your Grace.

321
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,710
Why are you here?

322
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,420
Why were you kidnapped, too?

323
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,020
What do we do next?

324
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,540
Where's your princess?

325
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,820
She was also taken here.

326
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,500
But she isn't locked with us.

327
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

328
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,060
So, the Prettiest Lady in the desert

329
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,820
turns out to be her.

330
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,740
Let's drink it up. Come on.

331
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,500
See who drinks faster.

332
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,980
Three bowls.

333
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,020
I won't drink.

334
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,500
You drink first.

335
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,100
You can't hold it. You lost, huh?

336
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,660
You just lost. Here.

337
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,560
Come on. Let's drink.

338
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,780
Guys, enjoy yourselves.

339
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,940
Come on. Cheers.

340
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,420
Five, the best.

341
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,100
Triple six.

342
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,900
- Drink.
- Cheers.

343
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,340
Come on. Fill your cup.

344
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,700
Drink.

345
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,180
Aren't you hungry?

346
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,540
We have only one meal a day.

347
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,980
If you miss this one,

348
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,460
you can't eat until tomorrow night.

349
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,820
Interesting woman.

350
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,300
You're full?

351
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,340
Fox, eat this.

352
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,180
All right.

353
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,300
Let's eat.

354
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,420
Come on.

355
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,260
Leaving already?

356
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,740
The Prettiest Lady in the desert.

357
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,500
What makes you so different?

358
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,380
Eyes.

359
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,580
You have angry and proud eyes.

360
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,980
And your heart

361
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,900
is filled with passion and bravery.

362
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,100
Tell me. What is your name?

363
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,860
Chief.

364
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,260
Have a drink and get excited.

365
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,340
I don't want it.

366
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,460
You're my woman now.

367
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,340
I don't want it.

368
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,980
It's not up to you.

369
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,980
In this case,

370
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,540
let me be honest, too.

371
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,540
I'm on a mission

372
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,380
to marry the Lord of Yunpei.

373
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,180
Nobody and nothing

374
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,420
can escape my eyes.

375
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,700
But I once swore.

376
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,460
I'd only marry someone
who could unify the desert

377
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,380
instead of a savage bandit

378
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,300
just like you.

379
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,020
For a dozen years in the desert,

380
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,660
no one has dared to underestimate me.

381
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,620
Even Na Zhan wouldn't dare.

382
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,420
Not to mention a woman like you.

383
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,860
What?

384
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,260
Feel bad when a woman despises you, huh?

385
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,460
I can look up at you.

386
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,420
Just release my clansmen.

387
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,420
Negotiate with me?

388
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,860
You know what?

389
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,940
If you weren't this pretty...

390
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,060
Does this blade weigh a lot?

391
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,700
Do you know its name?

392
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,460
Ghost Slayer.

393
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,780
I don't remember how many people

394
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,300
it has slayed.

395
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,620
You drugged me?

396
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,500
So, the drug is working.

397
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,340
Do you know the sap of twin fruit tree?

398
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,260
It weakens you and turns you on.

399
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,380
How shameless!

400
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,300
Tell me.

401
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,940
What is your name?

402
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,540
I will never tell you my name.

403
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,060
Someday, you will.

404
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,980
From this day on,

405
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,020
you'll be my girl.

406
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,900
Don't turn around.

407
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,580
Huo Qingyun?

408
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,380
Still remember my name?

409
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,140
Since you dare to break in,

410
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,500
you should negotiate to my face.

411
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,860
What? Too ashamed to see me?

412
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,380
Do you think you can provoke me?

413
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,740
Fine. If you kill me,

414
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,220
you can't get out of here.

415
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
I don't mean to kill you.

416
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,340
So, you want to take her away.

417
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,580
Yes.

418
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,980
Fine.

419
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,740
Exchange her life for mine.

420
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,420
You can take her away.

421
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,140
And my clansmen.

422
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,580
Release them.

423
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,020
I said,

424
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,540
exchange your life for mine.

425
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,260
Or nobody can leave.

426
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,540
Bottoms up.

427
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,420
All right.

428
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,380
Today, I'll let you live.

429
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,500
Drink it.

430
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,980
No.

431
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,420
I don't need this.

432
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,900
Tastes great.

433
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,140
I'll take it

434
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
as our wedding wine.

435
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
One day,

436
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,180
you will be my woman.

437
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,300
Let's drink it up.

438
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,340
Nice wine.

439
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,340
Let's drink.

440
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,580
Unconvinced? Keep drinking.

441
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,260
- Chief.
- Chief.

442
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,500
Chief,

443
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,260
why did you finish so soon?

444
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,140
Chief, is she really that sexy?

445
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,740
She ran away.

446
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,340
Chief, let me fill your cup.

447
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,460
You guys go on.

448
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,580
Go on.

449
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,420
Let's enjoy ourselves.

450
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,540
Let's drink. Come on.

451
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,380
Cheers.

452
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,580
Where are you taking me?

453
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,880
To save your life.

454
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,700
Thank you.

455
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,080
I'm repaying you.

456
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,180
Let me go. I can ride myself.

457
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,780
The ride is bumpy.

458
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,220
And Feita is tough.

459
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,020
I have to protect you.

460
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,340
You pushed my hair back?

461
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,500
The wind blew hard.
Your veil was blown away.

462
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,020
Your hair...

463
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,690
I can't see the way clearly.

464
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,440
I'll buy you a new one.

465
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,900
The wind blew it away.

466
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,550
Not your fault.

467
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,340
The wind is to blame. So am I.

468
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,340
What's wrong?

469
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,980
Is the drug working?

470
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,180
I'm cold.

471
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,580
Cold.

472
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,140
So cold.

473
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,420
What? Feeling any better?

474
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,860
Sorry.

475
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,780
It's not your fault.

476
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,580
I failed to protect you.

477
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,540
Hang in there.

478
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,740
An oasis is over there.

479
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,460
We'll spend the night here.

480
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,660
I've secretly hidden these jewels.

481
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,860
Take them as traveling expenses.

482
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,660
I will help you out.

483
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,820
- Open the door.
- Yes.

484
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,840
You...

485
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,060
Where are you taking me?

486
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,940
You...

487
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,840
Your Grace.

488
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,180
- Go back.
- Where are you taking me?

489
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,340
Behave yourselves.

490
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,480
Have some water.

491
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,940
Don't be so vigilant.

492
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,840
This isn't the water you gave me.

493
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,060
The desert is unstable
and people are hard to see through.

494
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,900
I know little about you
and I have to be vigilant.

495
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,140
Do you think I'm a nice guy?

496
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,180
You saved me, anyway.

497
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,700
Here. Eat it.

498
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,780
The Eternal Winter Grass is an antidote.

499
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,340
But it'll make me sleep
for seven days and nights.

500
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,300
I can't waste so much time.

501
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,580
It's better than dying, anyway.

502
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,340
You still don't trust me.

503
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,980
I have to reach Yunpei within five days.

504
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,980
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

505
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,460
What? Are you all right?

506
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,020
Yes. I'm fine.

507
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,180
So hot.

508
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,540
You can't continue like this.

509
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,980
Hurry. Eat it.

510
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,030
No.

511
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,660
I will get over it.

512
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,380
Stop being stubborn, will you?

513
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,820
