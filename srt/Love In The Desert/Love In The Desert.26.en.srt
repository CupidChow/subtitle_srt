Are you all right?

196
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,790
Your Grace,

197
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,070
we heard about everything.

198
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,500
Mr. Huo...

199
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,780
Princess Xinwei isn't dead.

200
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,740
Na Zhan hung her up.

201
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,100
She isn't dead?

202
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,220
No.

203
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,900
Na Zhan wants to use her

204
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,320
to get you back to Yunpei.

205
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,070

For the last moment of Ge Xinwei.

226
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,070
Get in.

227
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,380
For a mere edict,

228
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,260
you've done so much.

229
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,860
Now, the whole desert is yours.

230
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,430
Does your identity

231
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,950
really matter that much?

232
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,110
People will gossip about my throne.

233
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,740
I should make absolutely certain.

234
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,990
Are you born to be so ashamed?

235
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,710
You're here to save her, huh?

236
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,950
What can you offer in return?

237
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,950
I can help you to unify the desert.

238
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,710
Only I

239
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,020
know the beset about Tiandu.

240
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,700
All right.

241
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,860
Bring her to us.

242
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,870
Ge Xinwei,

243
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,670
be grateful to your lifesaver.

244
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,950
Because of her,

245
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,230
I let you live.

246
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,900
Why do you bother to save me?

247
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,230
I'm saving myself.

248
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,630
Keeping you alive

249
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,910
is my responsibility for Enaqi.

250
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,150
Fulfill your promise.

251
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,190
Let her go and keep me.

252
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,390
But now, I don't want to do that.

253
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,540
Because she read

254
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,580
Rong Ruo's suicide note.

255
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,340
So, the two of you...

256
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,670
One can live.

257
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,820
The other will die.

258
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,990
What?

259
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,910
You won't move?

260
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,300
Let me help you, then.

261
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,020
This blade...

262
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,190
We're so familiar with its owner.

263
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,220
Of course.

264
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
He kidnapped you

265
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,100
and saved you.

266
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,100
He loved me

267
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,500
and left me alone.

268
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,580
Who will be killed

269
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,300
by Ruo Wen's blade

270
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,380

you wouldn't be suffering this.

283
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,100
I don't regret it at all.

284
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,100
I was being Ge Xinwei, the free girl,

285
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,910
and I met Ruo Wen.

286
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,230
I've never been so carefree before.

287
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,470
Now,

288
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,630
I can go where he is.

289
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,030
Ge Xinwei.

290
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,900
Ge Xinwei.

00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,950
Somebody!

292
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,430
Do you think

293
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,020
you've taken control of everything?

294
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,500
All alone,

295
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,300
even if we break in,

296
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,910
we can't kill Na Zhan.

297
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,470
Miss Beishuang,

298
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,670
actually we have

299
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,950
a trump card.

300
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,620
Commander Shi,

301
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,620
come in.

302
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,030
Mr. Sha.

303
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,710
Commander Shi is one of Boa Agents.

304
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,940
He's lurked around Wu Jihai for ten years.

305
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,820
Wu Jihai thinks very highly of him.

306
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,990
Na Zhan trusts him, too.

307
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,710
After Wu Jihai died,

308
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,870
he became the commander.

309
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,660
The passageways are available now.

310
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,340
All Boa Agents

311
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,870
will ambush in the Council Room.

312
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,470
Are you going to rebel?

313
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,910
Time to reveal the truth.

314
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,710
Huo Qingyun is dead.

315
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,820
You can't prove anything.

316
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,740
What if he isn't dead?

317
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,790
Na Zhan.

318
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,070
No way.

319
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,030
No way.

320
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,060
In no way can you still be alive.

321
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,470
Na Zhan is suspicious.

322
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,820
Will it work?

323
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,300
I don't mean to fool him.

324
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,390
Act like Qingyun well enough

325
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,990
and distract him

326
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,820
to create a time gap.

327
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,990
I'm sure I can kill him.

328
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,230
It can't be.

329
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,500
No one

330
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,060
can take away my throne.

331
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,270
Traitor,

332
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,220
you've taken this throne

333
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,740
for 15 years.

334
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,150
In people's eyes,

335
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,870
you're a heartless wolf.

336
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,630
You never know

337
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,630
the pain and despair
of losing your family.

338
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,540
To realize your selfish desires,

339
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,740
and to chase power,

340
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,990
you killed hundreds of innocent people.

341
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,100
The late lord Na Qida,

342
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,580
Rong Ruo and his brother,

343
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,860
Ruo Wen,

344
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,620
and the family of Boa Agents

345
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,430
who are right here.

346
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,870
You're definitely condemned.

347
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,790
In the future,

348
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,710
your sinful name

349
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,780
will spread in the desert

350
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,150
and be repugnant forever.

351
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,670
In the history book,

352
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,630
you'll be cursed through the ages.

353
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,430
Your so-called dignity

354
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,260
will be worthless.

355
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,380
Na Zhan,

356
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,470
you usurped power 15 years ago

357
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,820
and poisoned Lord Na Qida of Yunpei.

358
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,430
I witnessed that.

359
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,030
Later,

360
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,260
you murdered my brother and his wife

361
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,150
and killed many innocent civilians.

362
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,470
For all these people,

363
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,740
you have to pay with blood!

364
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,260
Get lost!

365
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,340
Get lost!

366
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,950
My father An Yang

367
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,100
(Father An Yang)
was murdered by Na Zhan

368
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,630
in the 338th year!

369
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,950
My father Qin Feng

370
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,910
was lashed to death by Na Zhan

371
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,670
in the 330th year!

372
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,710
My father Liu Xi was forced to suicide

373
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,380
(Father Li Lin)
in the 331th year!

374
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,340
My father Li Lin was killed

375
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,820
by Na Zhan in the 334th year!

376
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,580
My father Han Lin was killed by Na Zhan

377
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,870
in the 338th year!

378
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,740
My father Cui Cheng was lashed to death

379
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,940
by Na Zhan in the 332th year!

380
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,100
Get out!

381
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,230
Get out of here!

382
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,470
Now!

383
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:20,580
Kill him! Kill him!

384
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,190
(Father)
Kill Na Zhan, the evil!

385
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,990
(Father)
Kill this evil man!

386
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,630
- Kill him!
- Kill!

387
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,060
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

388
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,060
I never expected

389
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,020
the edict

390
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,950
was hidden under my throne

391
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,910
for 15 years.

392
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,870
According to Na Qida,

393
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,470
the 49th lord of Yunpei,

394
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,390
my son Na Yanxing

395
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,740
is as respectable as me

396
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,740
and he can take the throne.

397
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,430
I'm making him Lord of Yunpei

398
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,870
to reign over the city.

399
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,710
Greetings, My Lord.

400
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,060
That's fake!

401
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,820
I'm the real lord.

402
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,990
He doesn't know Yunpei at all.

403
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,470
How can he be the Lord?

404
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,260
I'm the real lord.

405
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,630
I'm the real lord.

406
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,260
I'm the king of the desert.

407
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,710
Under my command, everybody.

408
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,950
Abolish everything
between Yunpei and other tribes.

409
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,030
Harsh taxes,

410
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,140
annual tribute,

411
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,270
corvee,

412
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,230
and marriage system.

413
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,300
Return the oases where they belong.

414
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,380
The six volumes of the Desert Scroll

415
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,300
made by the late lord Na Qida

416
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,230
will be spread widely
to benefit the people.

417
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,670
We'll share the methods
of desertification control and forestation.

418
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,420
Carry them out without delay.

419
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,870
Yes, My Lord.

420
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,870
You did a good job.

421
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,100
Promise me.

422
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,710
You'll live.

423
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,020
Qingyun!

424
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,230
Let go!

425
