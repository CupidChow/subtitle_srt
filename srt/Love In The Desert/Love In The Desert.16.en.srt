00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,230
We'll use all this.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,700
Got it.

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,140
Look.

27
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,860
(The hour of Hai today)

28
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,020
I verified it.

29
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,500
According to the Herb Volume,
the skin mask is resilient.

30
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,900
But do not wet it.

31
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,700
Or it'll melt.

32
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,540
Listen.

33
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,740
Na Zhan loves to play chess in the night.

34
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,450
At the hour of Hai every day,

35
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,670
he has Wu Jihai play chess in his study.

36
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,460
Whether he wins or loses,

37
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,500
there's only one round.

38
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,070
Wu Jihai plays poorly.

39
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,460
He can't defeat Na Zhan

40
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,670
and will lose.

41
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,670
About half an hour at most.

42
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,700
It's a perfect opportunity.

43
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,350
A quarter.

44
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,630
That's enough.

45
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,110
You must not take it lightly.

46
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,030
There are patrols outside the mansion.

47
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,500
To get Rong Huo out of the dungeon,

48
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,670
you need Na Zhan's token and warrant.

49
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,470
I've prepared them for you.

50
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,380
This is Wu Jihai's armor and sword.

51
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,670
Most importantly,

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,700
to leave the mansion at night,

53
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,260
you need Wu Jihai's token.

54
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,140
It's the hardest thing to get.

55
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,670
When I was hunted by him,

56
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,860
I remembered what it looked like.

57
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,870
Paint it.

58
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,620
Boa Agents can fake one.

59
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,790
Everything's ready.

60
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,740
Let's fake a scene.

61
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,620
(General's Token)

62
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,740
After we succeed, we'll

63
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,540
signal with fireworks.

64
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,700
Mr. Rong Huo.

65
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,740
- Decoction.
- Qingyun.

66
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,110
Qingyun, sit down.

67
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,590
Let me take a good look at you.

68
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,230
All these years,

69
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,030
you've been away from home.

70
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,150
You must have suffered a lot.

71
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,780
Mr. Rong Huo,

72
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
I bear responsibilities.

73
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,300
What I've suffered

74
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,990
is nothing.

75
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,860
But Na Zhan is cunning.

76
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,470
You don't have enough power against him.

77
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,260
Whatever you do,

78
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,470
be very careful.

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,180
Don't worry about me.

80
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,260
Mr. Rong Huo.

81
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,140
These are

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,340
distress letters

83
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,500
sent to Tiandu

84
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,940
by weak tribes near Yunpei.

85
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,300
According to them,
Na Zhan holds the tyranny

86
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,390
and extorts taxes

87
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,410
(To the Lord of the North)
to satisfy his desires.

88
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,860
He even had Soldiers in Red
rob people everywhere,

89
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,110
disguised as bandits.

90
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,300
His sins are heinous.

91
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,990
Sadly,

92
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,300
even if we have these letters,

93
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,420
we can't do anything.

94
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,990
Everybody knows Na Zhan

95
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,500
is the Lord of Yunpei.

96
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,870
Qingyun,

97
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,790
for the future,

98
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,470
what plan do you have?

99
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,460
I'll take revenge

100
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,670
for what he's done

101
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,910
and get justice for people in the desert.

102
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,420
Qingyun, you're just

103
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,550
as resilient as the late lord.

104
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,310
Mr. Rong Huo.

105
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,950
Mr. Rong Huo.

106
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,260
In this world,

107
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,710
you're the only one

108
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,710
who knows my real identity.

109
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,350
So, I beg you to help me.

110
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,710
For people in the desert,

111
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,350
for Yunpei,

112
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,820
and for your brother Mr. Rong Ruo,

113
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,030
let's find the real edict.

114
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Good.

115
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,790
Very good.

116
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,910
Qingyun, take your seat.

117
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,620
Actually,

118
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,380
only my brother knows

119
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,150
where the edict is.

120
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,350
So far,

121
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,710
he's been gone for 15 years.

122
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,860
Mercy, My Lord. Mercy.

123
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,230
That man looked exactly like General Wu.

124
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,620
He had the token and warrant.

125
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,950
The light was too dim.

126
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,660
I just...

127
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,860
I just didn't see the seal clearly.

128
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,380
I failed my job.

129
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,950
Punish me.

130
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,070
Punish me, My Lord.

131
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,780
Without seeing the seal clearly,

132
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,020
why did you release Rong Huo?

133
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,790
My Lord,

134
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,110
someone pretended to be me

135
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,780
and did something so treasonous.

136
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,070
I will investigate it!

137
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,230
They ran away.

138
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,110
What's the point of that?

139
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,950
You.

140
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,190
Come over here.

141
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,740
Mercy, My Lord.

142
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,220
My Lord.

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,340
It's all right.

144
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,030
It's all right.

145
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
No one will steal my throne.

146
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,260
No one! No one!

147
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,150
The rebels

148
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,590
made it under our noses.

149
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,660
He even pretended to be our general.

150
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,190
Smug, indeed.

151
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,710
You.

152
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,860
Close the city gate

153
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,070
and search the city.

154
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,140
Bring him to me,

155
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,310
alive or dead.

156
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,230
Besides, kill everyone

157
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,590
who knows this secret.

158
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,270
Yes.

159
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,950
My Lord.

160
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,700
Letter.

161
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,950
Letter for you.

162
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,310
My Lord,

163
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,350
that's a distress letter from Masui.

164
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,140
The Lord of Masui...

165
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,620
I helped him once.

166
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,460
I'll leave the rest

167
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,260
to his fate.

168
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,740
Enemies! Shoot!

169
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,380
(Wine)

170
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,990
Guys,

171
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,230
move forward

172
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,990
for another 50 li

173
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,740
and we'll reach Masui.

174
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,620
I'll lead you

175
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,350
to conquer Masui!

176
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,620
Conquer Masui!

177
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,070
Conquer Masui!

178
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,980
Guys,

179
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,230
we're born in the endless desert.

180
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,670
To go insane,

181
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,260
let's go crazily insane!

182
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,310
To kill,

183
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,740
let's kill all the way there!

184
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,540
From this day on,

185
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,810
we're no longer bandits

186
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,990
who wander in the desert.

187
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,660
I'll take you

188
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,020
to build our own city.

189
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,070
Let's march all the way south,

190
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,900
raise the yellow flag,

191
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,860
and print the black crown on it!

192
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,780
We'll occupy wherever we want

193
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,070
and take whatever we want.

194
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,020
Our name will be

195
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,020
Army of Desert Rankers!

196
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,900
Go insane and kill!

197
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,070
Go insane and kill!

198
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,860
Guys,

199
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,710
let's drink it up.

200
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,860
Unless we die,

201
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,230
we won't stop!

202
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

203
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,940
(Masui)

204
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,380
My Lord,

205
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,350
Desert Rankers have
come up to the outer city.

206
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,900
Our soldiers can stop them.

207
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,710
They assault really fiercely.

208
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,670
I'm afraid

209
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,020
we can't hold for very long.

210
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,990
Any reply from Yunpei?

211
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,660
We've sent three letters
for reinforcements.

212
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,580
So far,

213
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,660
there hasn't been a reply.

214
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,780
Officials,

215
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,990
any opinions?

216
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,430
My Lord.

217
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,500
In my opinion,

218
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,710
we should send
an envoy to Yunpei immediately.

219
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,900
If we get Na Zhan's Soldiers in Red,

220
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,070
we will certainly

221
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,110
exterminate the 4,000 bandits.

222
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,590
It's a good idea.

223
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,380
But the point is

224
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,860
this envoy has to arrive
within three days.

225
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,900
Or our city can't hold for that long.

226
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,910
Besides,

227
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,430
who shall we dispatch?

228
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,260
Once he's out of the city,

229
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,620
he has to leave his life to fate.

230
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,030
I'll go.

231
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,980
My Lord,

232
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,100
I'll go.

233
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,790
Good.

234
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,660
Zhan Bie, come back soon.

235
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,700
I will.

236
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,150
My Lord,

237
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
why don't you write a letter?

238
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,190
First, for peace.

239
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,310
Then...

240
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,460
Speak.

241
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,190
General Hua Yu has two daughters.

242
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,830
As the deputy leaders of dark guards,

243
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,950
the two of them

244
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,740
have enmity with Hua Yu.

245
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,190
They're loyal to you.

246
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,990
Why don't you send them for peace?

247
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,260
If Ruo Wen is lascivious,

248
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,020
then...

249
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,230
If they're hurt,

250
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,020
Hua Yu

251
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,780
won't let Ruo Wen go.

252
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,260
Wouldn't that

253
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,620
be even better?

254
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,470
If Hua Yu wants to take revenge,

255
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,230
he has to fight Ruo Wen.

256
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,070
Let's do this, then.

257
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,860
Yes.

258
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,350
Looks like you know very well

259
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,540
about the passageways.

260
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,230
Is Mr. Rong Huo out of town?

261
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,270
Don't worry.

262
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,260
He's settled down.

263
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,980
(Yun, Shuang)

264
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,780
I didn't know you would miss me like this.

265
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,940
What's so funny?

266
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,670
You also sewed my note

267
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,510
on the breast.

268
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,260
After all this,

269
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,230
I've realized one thing.

270
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,950
What is it?

271
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,150
You care a lot about me.

272
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,950
That's not true.

273
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,230
Yepei told me

274
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,390
when someone thought I would die,

275
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,260
he cried his heart out.

276
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,470
I wonder if I can see

277
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,390
the head of Boa Agents cry for me again.

278
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,230
You love to see a man cry for you?

279
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,190
Dangerous thinking.

280
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,870
It makes me proud, anyway.

281
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,860
Doesn't it?

282
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,470
I can't stay for long.

283
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,230
Mr. Rong Huo is saved.

284
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,910
You have no reason to stay.

285
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,790
Will you go with me?

286
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,950
I have a lot more things to do.

287
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,870
I can't leave yet.

288
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,310
You helped me save Rong Huo.

289
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,100
Na Zhan will trace it back to you.

290
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,390
He won't let you go.

291
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,470
I'm useful to Na Zhan.

292
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,260
I bet he won't hurt me.

293
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,190
But you're playing a dangerous game.

294
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,950
I can't watch you risk your life.

295
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,780
As you wish,

296
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,470
Masui will be occupied.

297
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,230
I'll get you an oasis, too.

298
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,950
Even the Desert Scroll...

299
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,470
I'll get it for you.

300
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,340
If you stay here, you can do nothing

301
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,100
but live nervously.

302
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,950
To save Enaqi

303
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,950
is my own mission.

304
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,780
I can't put you
on the opposite side of Yunpei.

305
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,540
If I leave with you,

306
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,580
Na Zhan won't let go of us.

307
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,190
Or Boa Agents.

308
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,500
You know I'm not scared.

309
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,230
I'm tired.

310
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,020
I'll go back.

311
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,180
My Lord.

312
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,780
The chef from Zhenqu.

313
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,220
He robbed Lady Youjia of her treasures

314
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,470
and broke into the Library.

315
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,300
And he stole our weapons.

316
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,540
He's Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers.

317
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,990
Now, he's heading for Masui.

318
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,260
Then who took away Rong Huo?

319
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,680
I checked all the guards on duty

320
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,190
the day Rong Huo was taken away.

321
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,540
I also interrogated those

322
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,990
who came in and out.

323
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,060
Nothing is suspicious.

324
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,670
Are you saying

325
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,670
they're still here?

326
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,470
Yes, perhaps.

327
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,060
However hard they try,

328
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,430
they can't take away that old guy.

329
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,710
Search more carefully.

330
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,580
Yes.

331
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,580
(Bright Glory)

332
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,060
You're not summoned.

333
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,580
Please leave.

334
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,870
If I can't see His Lordship,

335
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,870
I'll break in!

336
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,950
How dare you?

337
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,630
This isn't where you can make a scene.

338
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,190
I beg the Lord to send troops

339
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,230
to aid Masui!

340
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,420
Greetings, My Lord.

341
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,940
Zhan Bie,

342
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,300
the reinforcements

343
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,540
will only deteriorate the war.

344
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,740
It will give Masui

345
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,910
a disadvantage.

346
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,790
My Lord,

347
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,430
your Soldiers in Red

348
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,100
will awe Desert Rankers.

349
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,990
Then we'll have a chance to fight back.

350
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,710
You don't know much about Ruo Wen.

351
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,460
He's bloodthirsty and vicious.

352
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,020
In no way will he be pushed around.

353
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,340
My Lord.

354
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,950
Ruo Wen must be well prepared.

355
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,390
If we move rashly

356
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,670
to burn down his bridges,

357
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
he'll even assault more fiercely.

358
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,230
By then, people in Masui

359
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,990
will really suffer.

360
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,910
It's not that I don't want to help.

361
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,190
But we need a perfect plan

362
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,430
to save your people from misery.

363
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,070
We'll think of a plan.

364
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,030
But...

365
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,340
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

366
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,270
My Lord.

367
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,870
The Ritual Festival is two days away.

368
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,150
Any orders, My Lord?

369
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,300
I'll have them done.

370
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,270
Hold a banquet

371
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,990
and we'll eat together.

372
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,310
Yes.

373
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,830
Ninth Princess.

374
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,230
Ninth Princess,

375
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,100
you don't know me.

376
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,070
But I remember you.

377
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,190
You were generous enough

378
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,950
to often help poor people in Masui.

379
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,150
This is Lady Beishuang of Yunpei.

380
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,670
Don't get the wrong woman.

381
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,830
Your Grace,

382
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,100
you helped me before.

383
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,630
I wouldn't get it wrong.

384
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,470
Masui will be conquered.

385
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,260
Please help us.

386
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,870
I'm Huang Beishuang,

387
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,430
the princess of Enaqi

388
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,470
and the concubine of the Lord of Yunpei.

389
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,630
Not the Ninth Princess.

390
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,590
You get the wrong woman.

391
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,790
Your Grace,

392
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,020
what do we do?

393
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,470
Don't panic. Let's be careful.

394
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,460
He won't do silly things.

395
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,270
Who are you?

396
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm your ally.

397
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,670
Instead of waiting anxiously,

398
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,020
why don't you cooperate with me?

399
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,230
I can send my clansmen to aid Masui

400
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,190
and buy you some time.

401
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,420
Why do you offer to help me?

402
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,470
What do I have to do in return?

403
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,300
All you have to do is tell the Lord

404
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,060
Huang Beishuang
is the Ninth Princess of Masui.

405
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
What do you mean?

406
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,430
I don't understand.

407
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,230
His Lordship refused to aid Masui.

408
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,150
Maybe your princess stopped him.

409
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,470
It can't be true.

410
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,340
Her Grace would never watch us die!

411
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,260
If Huang Beishuang's cover is blown,

412
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,060
you'll have more leverage.

413
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,300
When his woman's tribe is invaded,

414
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,540
His Lordship can't

415
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,500
wriggle out of it.

416
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,990
Then naturally,

417
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,580
he will send troops.

418
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,830
But...

419
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,390
If I do this, Her Grace

420
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,100
will be guilty of deception.

421
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,670
I can't do that.

422
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,990
Don't underestimate her.

423
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,190
An impostor like her
became His Lordship's concubine.

424
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,990
Your princess has a lot of tricks.

425
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,710
But...

426
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,580
What?

427
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,500
Will you watch Masui be invaded

428
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,020
and people become homeless?

429
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,910
Will you sacrifice all your people

430
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,100
for a mere princess?

431
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,100
- Chief.
- Look.

432
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,270
Bad news.

433
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,150
Battle emergency.

434
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,150
We sent 800 vanguards, but more than half

435
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,230
are dead or injured.

436
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,580
Just like I expected.

437
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,150
Masui is impregnable.

438
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,740
They called back all their soldiers

439
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,030
to defend the city.

440
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,300
It'll take at least eight or ten days.

441
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,150
I have an idea.

442
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,020
Tell me about it.

443
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,470
We can send guys
to cut the water source.

444
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,710
Masui mostly relies
on the Shuhe River in the east.

445
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,910
If we manage to cut it,

446
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,110
in less than five days,

447
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,710
they'll invite us in.

448
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,100
Chief,

449
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,630
will it take

450
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,910
too much manpower?

451
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,650
You aren't even as clever as her.

452
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,710
Off you go. Hurry.

453
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,660
Yes.

454
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,140
Chief,

455
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,220
the envoy of Masui is here to see you.

456
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,470
With two women.

457
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,900
Get them in.

458
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,660
Bring them in!

459
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,020
Chief Ruo Wen,

460
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,500
the Lord of Masui sent me for peace.

461
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,100
Here are two pretty ladies for you.

462
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,950
Hope you'll like them.

463
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,060
We'll give you our border town.

464
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,990
Leave the women to me.

465
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,390
You go back
and ask your lord to get a coffin.

466
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,230
Get lost now.

467
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,370
- But...
- Somebody!

468
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,260
Chief, think about it.

469
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,570
Take him away and keep the women.

470
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,430
You can't do this.

471
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,950
Chief Ruo Wen, please reconsider!

472
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,710
Please, Chief Ruo Wen!

473
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,910
What are your names?

474
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,660
Ruo Lan.

475
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,790
Fei Wen.

476
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,780
Your names sound like mine.

477
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,550
Why?

478
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,630
Because we'll be your women.

479
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,580
If you don't mind,

480
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,300
we'll serve you

481
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
until we die.

482
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,580
What are your real names?

483
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,900
Hua Jiao.

484
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,070
Hua Ting.

485
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,150
Here, we offer the letter of peace.

486
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,550
Wolf,

487
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,470
take them away.

488
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,430
Desert Rankers don't need other women.

489
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,500
- Chief.
- Wait.

490
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,630
Pretty women. Keep them.

491
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,260
Dress yourselves up

492
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,230
and come to this camp tonight.

493
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,260
Ruo Wen, screw you.

494
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,630
Disloyal and horny man!

Drink some.

503

Let go! What do you want?

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,780
Oh, pretty.

505
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,380
Let go of me!

506
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Be gentle.

507
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,100
Ruo Wen,

508
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,580
you're lost in lust.

509
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,820
Let me calm you down.

510
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,950
I don't kill you

511
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,740
for the sake of your father,
General Hua Yu.

512
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,830
How do you know?

513
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,780
Kill us if you like.

514
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,900
Don't bother to nag.

515
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,100
You've got a quick temper.

516
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,630
Just like your father, huh?

517
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,390
If General Hua Yu

518
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,060
knows I've captured you,

519
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,950
what will he think?

520
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,300
He won't care about us.

521
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,230
Threatening him with us is pointless.

522
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,990
Are you saying

523
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,630
everyone in your family is tough

524
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,500
and I can't make you surrender?

525
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,390
Don't be ungrateful.

526
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,180
You know what?

527
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,260
Without your father,

528
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,150
we can also break into town!

529
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,180
Princess Xinwei.

530
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,470
Don't be impulsive.

531
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,820
Don't ruin Chief's plan.

532
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,470
Princess Xinwei?

533
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,870
You're Ge Xinwei, the Ninth Princess?

534
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,020
Yes, what?

535
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,230
Your Grace,

536
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,990
my family have been waiting for you.

537
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,910
After Ge'er Jinqin usurped power,

538
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,910
my father didn't pledge loyalty to him.

539
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,540
My sister and I

540
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,790
pretended to go over to Ge'er Jinqin

541
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,740
just to protect our father.

542
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,630
We also pretended

543
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,230
to break up to deceive Ge'er Jinqin.

544
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,540
Father has been waiting

545
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,020
until you return to Masui

546
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,910
and help you get rid of the rebel.

547
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,990
(I'll use their plan)

548
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,150
(and make it work for us.)

549
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,540
Is General Hua Yu

550
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,990
really this loyal?

551
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,950
That's helpful, then.

552
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,270
The two of you,

553
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,820
write a letter to your father

554
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,630
and help us to break in.

555
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,260
But I have some confusion.

556
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,910
Why are you here, Your Grace?

557
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,390
(Watch and learn, idiots.)

558
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,740
Since my father

559
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,820
and my mother passed away,

560
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,950
I've been inconsolable.

561
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,660
I swore

562
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,630
I would avenge them.

563
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,780
Luckily, I met Chief Ruo Wen.

564
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
He's kindhearted

565
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,670
and generous.

566
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,870
He's willing to help me.

567
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,780
Now,

568
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,230
I've met you here.

569
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,990
With the help of General Hua Yu,

570
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,340
I believe

571
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,900
breaking into town

572
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,670
is just a matter of time.

573
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,740
Your Grace.

574
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,500
(Yunfang Pavilion)

575
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,140
I knew it wouldn't work.

576
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,340
Petty trick.

577
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,910
I made the incense in the censer.

578
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,950
I'm familiar with the smell.

579
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,540
Today, I have to take you away.

580
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,940
Zhan Bie isn't a nice guy.

581
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,540
I know how to deal with him.

582
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,670
Don't worry about me.

583
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,380
I said,

584
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,870
I won't put you in danger.

585
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,870
If necessary,

586
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,940
I'll even abduct you.

587
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,870
Why are you so obedient today?

588
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,870
Because I know

589
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,580
you'll respect me.

590
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,940
Besides,

591
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,300
even if you abduct me,

592
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,540
I have legs to walk.

593
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,420
It's cold.

594
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,950
You've changed.

595
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,390
How?

596
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,260
You've gained weight.

597
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,230
Nonsense.

598
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,060
You're weaker, actually.

599
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,470
So, will you leave here

600
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,860
with a weak man?

601
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,060
To run away?

602
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
That's not me.

603
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,100
Then I'll go kill Zhan Bie now.

604
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,190
What do you say?

605
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,580
Don't be impulsive.

606
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,310
I know his weakness.

607
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,790
You have to do this

608
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,470
before the Ritual Festival.

609
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,750
All right.

610
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,220
Today is the annual Ritual Festival.

611
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,350
Ladies and gentlemen,

612
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,100
hope you will

613
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,140
enjoy tonight.

614
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,750
Raise your cups.

615
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,390
Let's

616
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,060
have a drink.

617
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,750
Greetings, My Lord.

618
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,430
If you do a good job today,

619
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,700
you'll be rewarded.

620
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,620
But if...

621
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,430
If you fail,

622
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,870
you'll lose your life.

623
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,420
Don't worry.

624
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,830
Zhan Bie will help you.

625
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,350
Who are you?

626
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,140
I'm Guo'er, from Enaqi's convoy.

627
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,910
I was kidnapped by Desert Rankers.

628
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,100
Later, I escaped.

629
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,540
I have something to tell you.

630
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,540
Speak.

631
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,540
Among the ladies for marriage,

632
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,060
one is

633
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,180
an impostor.

634
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,660
Do you know

635
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,750
what you're talking about?

636
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,990
The lady in the portrait
is the real princess of Enaqi.

637
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,060
The one by your side

638
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,790
is an impostor.

639
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,020
Get it to me.

640
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Go on.

641
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,260
She isn't

642
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,750
our princess.

643
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,660
She's the Ninth Princess of Masui.

644
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,950
She switched identities
with our princess.

645
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,590
Guo'er,

646
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,430
you misbehaved and talked rudely.

647
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,900
You took the lead to bully my wet nurse.

648
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,580
I just lashed and scolded you.

649
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,580
How dare you fake something

650
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,700
to frame me?

651
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,350
Your identity is fake.

652
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,180
You're an impostor.

653
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,430
Who knows what you're up to?

654
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,580
I've done nothing wrong to you.

655
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,750
Why do you have to frame me?

656
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,350
No excuses will work.

657
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,910
Stop denying it.

658
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
She's one of my convoy, indeed.

659
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,220
But she hates me

660
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,540
and wants to frame me.

661
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,990
Lianhuan and Yepei

662
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,140
are in charge of the convoy.

663
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,100
Get them here to confront her.

664
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,750
Get them here.

665
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,020
Speak.

666
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,870
Guo'er?

667
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,350
Guo'er? You...

668
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,940
What are you doing here?

669
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,350
She's an impostor.

670
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,790
You serve an impostor! How despicable!

671
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,910
She's our princess.

672
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,620
We pledge to follow her.

673
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,630
When we were threatened
by Desert Rankers,

674
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,540
you slept with those bandits.

675
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,700
How do you explain this?

676
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,140
Don't sling mud at me!

677
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,540
I...

678
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,430
I didn't have a choice.

679
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,140
Our convoy was slaughtered.

680
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,140
Lady Beishuang tried hard
to save Lianhuan and me.

681
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,620
How did you get out?

682
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,750
She saved you guys.

683
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,660
Of course, you take her side.

684
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,540
It's you who surrendered to bandits.

685
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,140
Now, you frame us.

686
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,180
My Lord, I have another witness.

687
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,580
He can prove she is the Ninth Princess.

688
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,350
You know this man, too.

689
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,540
He's the envoy of Masui,

690
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,670
Zhan Bie.

691
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,390
You're the envoy of Masui.

692
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,700
Do you know

693
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,310
the weight of what you're going to say?

694
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,350
Don't worry, My Lord.

695
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,270
A martial artist never lies.

696
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,060
Mr. Zhan Bie,

697
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,430
do you know the Ninth Princess of Masui?

698
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,540
Yes.

699
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,870
So, is she the Ninth Princess?
