You haven't left yet?

25
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,030
You're grieved.

26
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,860
And I'm worried.

27
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,470
What happened

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,633
- is my...
- It's my fault.

29
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,420
I wasn't aware.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,230
We used to have a deep misunderstanding.

31
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,110
Now, we know the truth.

32
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,830
Don't blame yourself.

33
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,140
Will you forgive me?

34
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,460
It's a misunderstanding.

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,860
I shouldn't have hated you.

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,740
Why would I forgive you?

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,140
These days,

38
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
I was eager to see you.

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,550
I didn't dare, either.

40
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,700
What if you don't trust me?

41
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,660
What if

42
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,270
you won't forgive me?

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,700
Leave with me,

44
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,870
will you?

45
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,460
Huo Qingyun,

46
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,110
we can never be together.

47
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,740
We shouldn't move forward.

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,460
Hope you won't reply so quickly.

49
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,020
This is my deliberate decision.

50
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,140
Even if you don't go with me,

51
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
you can't stay here.

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,300
Who came to me again?

53
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,510
I'm here for the Architecture Volume.

54
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,350
It's not here.

55
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,110
Search anywhere else you want.

56
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,790
You really don't know where it is?

57
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,350
I don't care about this book.

58
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,230
All you care for is this portrait.

59
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,270
I'll tear it up.

60
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,550
Don't spin me.

61
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,300
I can't breathe.

62
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,060
Then I'll suffocate you.

63
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,990
You're off your game.

64
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,350
What are you talking about?

65
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,420
I saw Huo Qingyun and Huang Beishuang

66
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,990
get into the room.

67
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,710
That's good.

68
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,150
Wise man.

69
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,590
In this world, no one else

70
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,910
cares for you like this.

71
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,500
Where are you going?

72
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,150
To take a bath.

73
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,350
Wait here for me.

74
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,950
All right.

75
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,300
Make it quick.

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,300
I will.

77
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,110
He finally knows what to do.

78
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,060
(Tablet of Lord Ge'er Re)

79
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,940
(Mother,)

80
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,380
(I'm so silly)

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,620
(that I'm stuck in love.)

82
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,350
(Please give me some advice.)

83
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,380
(Will he and I end up well?)

84
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,550
(If it's the head,)

85
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,300
(after I take revenge,)

86
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,460
(I'll go to the Central Plains
and never return.)

87
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,940
(If it's the tail...)

88
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,180
It's late.

89
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,140
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,110
Where's Huo Qingyun?

91
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,590
He isn't here.

92
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,030
Tell me.

93
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,060
You never get along with him.

94
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,350
Why did you let him into Fentian?

95
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,230
He offered something, of course.

96
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,260
I can get any intel from Boa Agents.

97
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Also, he wanted to see you

98
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,590
and take you away.

99
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,030
Looks like

100
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,500
he failed to do that.

101
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,550
It's too late.

102
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,990
I'm going to bed.

103
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,060
You should go.

104
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,670
I helped you take revenge.

105
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,380
But you want to kill me?

106
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,510
Come on.

107
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,030
Or I'd kill myself.

108
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,300
Huang Beishuang,

109
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,550
your eyes

110
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,590
get me stuck in confusion.

111
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,910
I dare you to touch her.

112
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,590
I'd like to see

113
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,550
the martial arts
of the head of Boa Agents.

114
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,660
Come on.

115
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,300
If you win, I won't touch her.

116
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,980
Ruo Wen!

117
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,740
Are you all right?

118
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,750
Aren't you supposed to be bathing?

119
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,110
What are you doing here?

120
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,790
An, you have to live.

121
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,910
What's wrong?

122
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,620
Come on. Get up.

123
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,740
Get up.

124
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,980
Let me check on you.

125
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,740
You're not bleeding.

126
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,670
We should go.

127
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,980
Ruo Wen.

128
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,470
Ruo Wen, don't scare me.

129
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,540
What is wrong?

130
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,260
Who on earth are you?

131
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,860
Why are you lingering in my head?

132
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,910
Ruo Wen.

133
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,190
Who are you?

134
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,910
Tell me.

135
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,190
Or I'll kill you!

136
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,620
Are you insane? I'm Ge Xinwei.

137
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,860
Madwoman?

138
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,430
You nearly strangled me.

139
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,580
Ruo Wen.

140
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,940
Ruo Wen.

141
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,460
Ruo Wen.

142
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,620
Ruo Wen, what's wrong?

143
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Did you really hurt your head?

144
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,070
Lie down here.

145
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,750
I'll go get a physician.

146
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,500
- Son!
- Mother.

147
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,660
Stop!

148
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,030
- Mother!
- My Lady.

149
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,230
An,

150
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,350
you have to live.

151
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,380
Mother.

152
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,470
Leave!

153
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,310
Mother.

154
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,780
Are you or are you not Rong An?

155
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,430
Chief, nothing in Yunpei
has been unusual.

156
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,720
Na Zhan

157
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,190
knew Miss Beishuang was kidnapped

158
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,860
but didn't do anything.

159
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,820
I get it.

160
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,980
But don't drop your guard.

161
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,460
Watch Na Zhan closely.

162
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,420
Yes.

163
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,780
What will you do next?

164
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,540
When Ruo Wen stays steady,

165
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,500
I'll discuss with him

166
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,150
how to fight against Na Zhan.

167
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,020
What about Miss Beishuang?

168
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,790
I won't force her.

169
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,500
If she wants to stay,

170
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,500
I'll let her stay.

171
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,110
Can you stop worrying?

172
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,710
She's wise enough.

173
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,340
She can deal with Na Zhan.

174
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,670
So, she can handle Ruo Wen.

175
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,500
Now, we focus on our great cause.

176
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,260
As for anything else,

177
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,030
we won't force it.

178
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,420
Anything else?

179
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,310
On my way here,

180
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,990
I saw Miss Beishuang

181
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,620
go to the Council Room.

182
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,910
Better let you go.

183
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,820
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

184
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,470
(Too bad for these books.)

185
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,110
(My father loved them when he was alive.)

186
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,190
(Is the Architecture Volume here?)

187
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,190
Even two strangers meet

188
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,590
in the middle of the night,

189
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,350
they should talk, huh?

190
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,710
I don't like to talk.

191
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,470
I started a conversation.

192
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,070
For the sake of courtesy,

193
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,590
shouldn't you reply?

194
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,950
I replied, didn't I?

195
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,687
Then why do you not look at me?

196
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,140
Why are you still here?

197
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,110
Looking for the Architecture Volume?

198
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,430
Ruo Wen told you that?

199
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,540
I guessed.

200
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,190
If I guess correctly,

201
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,470
you made a deal with Ruo Wen.

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,860
General Hua Yu of Feitian

203
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,900
turned himself
to Desert Rankers so smoothly.

204
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,140
You must have helped.

205
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,660
You always want something in return.

206
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,230
So, you must have
asked him for something.

207
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,710
Masui has the Herb Volume

208
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,990
and the Architecture Volume.

209
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,830
I thought about it.

210
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,380
Except this book,

211
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,950
nothing else is worth your risk.

212
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,590
I'm here for it, indeed.

213
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,590
We can negotiate, then.

214
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,430
I'll find the book for you.

215
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,620
You copy one for me.

216
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,180
Deal.

217
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,020
Since we're partners,

218
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,950
could you please be nice?

219
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,430
Since we're partners,

220
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,590
could you please behave yourself?

221
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,260
It's not here.

222
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,510
Go back.

223
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,430
You know where it is?

224
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,260
Go back for some sleep.

225
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,540
I'll tell you tomorrow.

226
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,140
My Lady, General Fox,

227
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,860
His Lordship is all right.

228
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,260
But just now, he was mad.

229
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,470
Did you check carefully?

230
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,470
Maybe he's drunk.

231
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,190
My Lady, don't worry.

232
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,190
He'll be fine after some sleep.

233
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,460
Out you go.

234
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,780
Ruo Wen.

235
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,700
Ruo Wen.

236
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,310
The physician said you were all right.

237
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,990
Don't try to scare me.

238
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,140
Maybe he's drunk.

239
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,590
Get some more sleep, then.

240
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,350
Stud,

241
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,590
I'll go get you some hangover soup.

242
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,740
Only when you're drunk

243
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,590
can you be so obedient.

244
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,830
I didn't eat, either.

245
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,230
Shall we eat together?

246
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,820
This is your meal.

247
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,660
If you want some,

248
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,020
don't bother to ask me.

249
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,070
The meal is for you.

250
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,270
So, it's yours.

251
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,990
I should ask you for permission.

252
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,580
I disapprove.

253
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,470
I have no appetite.

254
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,590
Eat it yourself.

255
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,860
If you want to know where the book is,

256
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,350
have regular meals.

257
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,630
You don't know where it is,

258
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,790
right?

259
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,020
Why do you ask?

260
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,260
You find excuses

261
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,150
and always hold it up.

262
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,390
Eat this

263
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,990
and I'll tell you.

264
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,300
You can tell me now, huh?

265
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,910
Indeed, I don't know where it is.

266
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,390
But you've lost weight.

267
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,260
I want you to eat and sleep well.

268
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,910
Get out of here.

269
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,300
Let me go.

270
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,140
This is right.

271
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,580
This is like you.

272
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,180
You fight when you're angry

273
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
and curse when you hate.

274
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,500
You're a rascal like always.

275
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,870
All right. Get to business.

276
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,430
Think carefully.

277
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,150
When you were little,

278
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,340
your father gave you the Herb Volume.

279
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,700
Did he set the other book

280
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,430
ready for you

281
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,060
and waited until you grew up?

282
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,300
Chief.

283
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,250
Shh.

284
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,710
What's up?

285
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,100
Is he not waking up yet?

286
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,580
I have something to tell him.

287
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,580
Why can't you make a decision?

288
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,990
Small tribes have sent
congratulation gifts.

289
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,260
The Lord should see them, huh?

290
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,790
I'll go, then.

291
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,030
Come on.

292
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,100
My Lady. My Lady.

293
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,380
- Go to Masui for the Ninth Lady.
- An, Father is back.

294
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,580
She's from your tribe.

295
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,750
- She'll help.
- What happened?

296
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,870
Leave with An from behind.

297
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,780
Na Zhan's soldiers will catch up.

298
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,260
What's the rush for?

299
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,950
I have no time to explain it.

300
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,590
I'm sorry to both of you.

301
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,780
Just leave. Go to Masui. Hurry.

302
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,300
If we leave, what about you?

303
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,580
Don't worry about me. Just go.

304
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,620
Hurry.

305
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,510
Let's go.

306
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,670
It's really here.

307
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,940
(The Architecture Volume
of the Desert Scroll)

308
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,060
I never met my mother.

309
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,950
When she gave birth to me,

310
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,217
she died of difficult labor.

311
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,340
I only saw her in a portrait.

312
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,630
When I was eight,

313
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Na Zhan killed my father.

314
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,470
Your father...

315
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,710
Isn't he the late lord of Tiandu?

316
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,300
He's my uncle.

317
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,190
The Lord's Mansion in Tiandu

318
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,950
is the bloody place

319
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,230
you told me about

320
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,150
where even kids are killed?

321
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,470
Yes.

322
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,300
Its name is Bingci Mansion.

323
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,060
Just like its name,

324
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,430
it's icy.

325
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,820
Why did Na Zhan kill your father?

326
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,500
He's born vicious.

327
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,230
To get more power,

328
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,630
he can do anything.

329
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,630
Sha Qu and most members of Boa Agents

330
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,740
are victims in his fight for power.

331
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,100
The late lord of Yunpei

332
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,670
and his trusted followers

333
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,190
were all murdered.

334
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,910
We nearly died in the desert.

335
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,710
Everyone has a blood feud

336
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,630
with Na Zhan.

337
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,670
You can't deceive me.

338
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,740
You pretend to be heartless

339
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,660
only because you want to risk your life

340
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,990
for what you want to do.

341
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,100
Huang Beishuang,

342
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,500
you nearly fooled me.

343
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,710
Don't be silly.

344
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,390
I've been bearing for 15 years.

345
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,430
I tried so hard to build Boa Agents

346
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,910
just to overturn Na Zhan someday.

347
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,100
I will

348
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,230
avenge everyone.

349
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,670
Why are you still asleep?

350
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,300
Slacking off, huh?

351
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,710
Just now, I met all the envoys for you.

352
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,630
If it weren't for you,

353
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,710
I wouldn't stay to suffer this.

354
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,870
Think about it.

355
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,710
We were supposed
to travel around the Central Plains.

356
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,990
But what did you do?

357
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,500
You took a city

358
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,740
and now we're trapped here.

359
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,340
But anyway,

360
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,990
don't be shy.

361
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,780
Later,

362
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,740
just give me a good wedding.

363
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,100
Do you hear?

364
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,060
Wake up.

365
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,060
Ruo Wen.

366
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,830
Ruo Wen, what is wrong?

367
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,100
What's going on with him?

368
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,140
Ruo Wen.

369
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,030
- Son.
- Son.

370
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,470
Son, come on.

371
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,310
Are you all right?

372
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,283
- Are you?
- I'm fine, Mother.

373
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,980
You can't run anywhere!

374
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,270
An!

375
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,340
An.

376
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,820
- Let's go.
- Go.

377
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,660
Stop!

378
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,860
Run.

379
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,990
Stop!

380
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,820
Honey.

381
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,100
- Honey.
- Mother.

382
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,470
How do you feel?

383
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,750
- Bad.
- Can you still walk?

384
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,990
I sprained my ankle.

385
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,020
You did? But...

386
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,910
Stop!

387
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,710
Take An away.

388
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,260
Go!

389
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,780
But honey...

390
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,390
Take him away.

391
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,980
Hurry!

392
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,260
- Mother.
- Run.

393
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,230
Leave me alone.

394
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,150
- You guys run.
- Go.

395
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,990
Mother!

396
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,310
- I'm not leaving!
- Run!

397
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,630
Let's go. Come on.

398
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,430
An, you have to live.

399
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,060
I'm not leaving!

400
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,230
Run!

401
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,470
- Mother!
- Let go!

402
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,390
Run, An!

403
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,540
An, run away!

404
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,470
- Mother, let's run together!
- Run!

405
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,780
Let go, An.

406
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,190
- Run!
- Run!

407
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,900
Let's go!

408
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,540
- Father, let me go!
- Leave.

409
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,870
Mother!

410
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,060
Mother!

411
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,190
Father, save Mother!

412
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,870
Mother!

413
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,510
After them!

414
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,470
Run.

415
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,990
Don't let them run away!

416
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,980
Kill one of them

417
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,470
and you'll get ten taels of gold!

418
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,020
After them!

419
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,950
Good boy.

420
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,150
Whatever happens,

421
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,260
just run. Run quickly.

422
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,100
Do you hear?

423
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,620
Take him down.

424
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,270
Go after the boy.

425
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,710
Quicksand!

426
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,100
If anything bad happens to His Lordship,

427
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,487
I'll cut you and feed you to dogs.

428
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,780
How's Ruo Wen?

429
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,100
Evil man from Tiandu.

430
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,100
I haven't settled with you yet.

431
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,470
Last night, you hurt Chief.

432
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,060
He isn't awake yet.

433
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,670
It's not time for argument.

434
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,780
You should get a physician.

435
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,540
Wolf.

436
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,340
Let's go.

437
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,540
Let's go, too.

438
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,540
What is wrong with him? Say something.

439
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,020
I'm not skilled enough.

440
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,780
I can't tell
what's wrong with His Lordship.

441
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,230
What about his head?

442
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,430
He fell previously.

443
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,340
There is no trauma.

444
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,100
Then, why isn't he awake?

445
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,500
I'm too silly to know.

446
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,150
Such useless physicians.

447
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,060
Kill them all.

448
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,910
Losers.

449
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,940
- I'm going to kill you.
- Stop.

450
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,020
It's just your fault!

451
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,260
If I remember correctly,

452
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,580
they are the best physicians

453
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,740
in this city.

454
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
You leave us.

455
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,190
Get up. Come on.

456
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,830
Go. Get out.

457
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,470
- Yes.
- Hurry.

458
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,100
Why are you still here?

459
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,150
When he wakes up,

460
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,540
we'll leave.

461
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,780
When he's awake,

462
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,230
can you really leave?

463
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,900
You want the Architecture Volume, huh?

464
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,580
I'll help you later, all right?

465
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,950
If you stay alone,

466
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,190
I'll be worried.

467
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,950
It's all because of you.

468
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,910
Maybe a great physician can help him.

469
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,500
But he's in Yunpei.

470
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,940
It's a long way away.

471
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,740
I'll take care of it.

472
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,300
It's my fault.

473
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,030
Ruo Wen,

474
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,950
I won't quarrel with you anymore.

475
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,190
Because the physician said

476
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,430
you might never wake up again.

477
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,670
I quarrel with you

478
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,060
because I love you.

479
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,230
I enjoy being with you

480
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,540
and I can't share you
with any other women.

481
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,500
You said you could hardly die.

482
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,300
Then get up.

483
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,260
Your men are waiting for you.

484
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,910
It took us so much trouble to take Masui.

485
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,670
Will you just leave it alone?

486
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,150
You don't want your men.

487
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,340
Do you not want me, too?

488
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,390
I shouldn't cry.

489
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,510
Such a jinx.

490
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,500
The book is found.

491
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,900
What will you do next?

492
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,230
Look for the next volume.

493
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,390
You know that's not what I mean.

494
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,190
Ruo Wen isn't awake yet.

495
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,113
We won't talk until he wakes up.

496
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,020
You care so much for him?

497
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,900
Yes, of course.

498
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,060
We're also close partners.

499
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,780
Also?

500
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,820
Are we merely partners, too?

501
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,860
Yes.

502
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,820
The Architecture Volume is found.

503
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,540
We're no longer partners.

504
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,100
May I beg you for another deal?

505
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,430
Don't beg me.

506
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,860
We can make a deal at any time.

507
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,820
Go with me.

508
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,190
I'll give you the last volume.

509
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,710
The Water Volume is in Tiandu.

510
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,670
Without my help,

511
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,780
you can't get it.

512
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,230
It's in Tiandu?

513
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,740
Go back to Tiandu with me.

514
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,430
Rest assured.

515
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,340
I'll have everything arranged.

516
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,670
As for Na Zhan,

517
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,380
like I said,

518
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,980
I'll take care of him.

519
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,100
I have to think carefully about it.

520
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,750
After all, I don't have
a very good impression

521
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,740
of you.

522
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,790
You have to

523
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,630
reply to me

524
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,030
before Ruo Wen wakes up.

525
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,960
No.

526
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
It's nonnegotiable.

527
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,780
You haven't slept for three days.

528
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,580
If it continues,

529
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,260
before Ruo Wen wakes up,

530
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,060
you'll break down.

531
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,500
Have something to eat.

532
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,470
No.

533
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,780
Ruo Wen hasn't eaten anything for days.

534
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,230
I won't eat, either.

535
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,230
If he dies,

536
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,340
in the worst case,

537
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,260
I'll die with him.

538
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,310
(Heyan Mansion)
Physician, this way, please.

539
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,270
All right.

540
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,190
Looks like

541
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,190
he's looking for something important.

542
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,820
His body is all right.

543
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,300
But his soul isn't here.

544
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,430
Isn't here?

545
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,270
Where is it, then?

546
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,540
In his dream.

547
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,820
Or I should say,

548
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,230
in his past.

549
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,100
- Keep searching.
- Yes.

550
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,580
When he wants to wake up,

551
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,540
he will wake up.

552
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,950
But if it continues,

553
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,540
his body can't hold.

554
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,580
Physician, he's been
in a coma for three days.

555
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,660
If he can't wake up,

556
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,190
his life will be in danger.

557
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,750
You're right.

558
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,870
If his soul goes too far away,

559
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,660
it can't come back.

560
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,910
You saved us once.

561
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,910
Please save him this time.

562
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,070
Whatever you want,

563
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,150
I'll give it to you.

564
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,870
Let's do this, then.

565
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,830
All I want is a full meal.

566
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,110
I'll eat here.

567
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,990
Prepare his favorite dishes.

568
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,590
Fox,

569
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,900
prepare a big meal.

570
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,310
This young man
kept me traveling for two days

571
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,580
and gave me nothing to eat.

572
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,270
Sorry.

573
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,940
Hey, girl.

574
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,860
You come and eat, too.

575
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,700
You don't want him to wake up?

576
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,550
If I eat,

577
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,790
will he wake up?

578
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,350
Yes. Come and eat.

579
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,190
Hurry.

580
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,060
- Look.
- Ruo Wen moved.

581
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,590
Which part?

582
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,860
Physician.

583
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,710
Physician.

584
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,900
He moved.

585
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,350
- You know what to do.
- Ruo Wen.

586
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,070
- Ruo Wen.
- Chief.

587
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,940
Chief.

588
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,270
I'll get all his favorite food.

589
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,110
Chief.

590
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,540
Come on. Try this.

591
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,860
Look.

592
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,390
- He's awake.
- He is.

593
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,790
Ruo Wen,

594
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,820
you're awake.

595
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,270
This is great.

596
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,270
Chief.

597
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,660
What is wrong with you?

598
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,950
Why are you around me?

599
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,790
You were in a coma for four days.

600
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,620
What took you so long to wake up?

601
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,190
I was so scared.

602
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,030
Chief.

603
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,300
Eat more.

604
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,460
Chief.

605
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,270
Oh, I'm full.

606
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,390
Send me back.

607
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,230
Eat slowly.

608
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,310
Slow down.

609
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,460
- Finally.
- Don't choke on it.

610
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,420
Thank you.

611
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,860
- Sha Qu.
- I was so worried.

612
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,700
Take him to an inn for tonight.

613
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,990
Send him back tomorrow.

614
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,190
All right.

615
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,590
Young man,

616
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,430
you owe him this.

617
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,590
Let's go.

618
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,810
- Eat more.
- Let's go.

619
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,950
- Anything?
- Come on.

620
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,540
Say something.

621
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,270
You were asleep these days.

622
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,540
I didn't eat or sleep.

623
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,310
Where are you going?

624
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,540
Don't follow me.

625
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,860
Does it hurt?

626
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,540
Where does it hurt? Get up.

627
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,830
Don't follow me.

628
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,750
- Get up.
- Leave me alone.

629
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,390
Where are you going? Don't go.

630
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,820
Ruo Wen!

631
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,620
