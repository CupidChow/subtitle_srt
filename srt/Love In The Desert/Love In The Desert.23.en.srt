24
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,750
Physician,

25
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,670
how is she?

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,180
Luckily,

27
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,110
her armor blocked some force.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,220
She stopped bleeding and she won't die.

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,220
Lucky, indeed.

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,860
But this lady is weak

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,990
and has lost too much blood.

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,670
I'm afraid she'll have
blood deficiency all her life.

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,700
What do we do?

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,950
It's not a big problem.

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,180
She can recuperate in the future.

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,460
- Glad to hear that.
- But...

37
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,790
Can't you finish all at once?

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,910
Yes.

39
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,790
I guess she can't get rid of this scar.

40
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,860
Anything else?

41
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,950
No.

42
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,420
Leave us.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,260
Yes.

44
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,830
Don't be sad.

45
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,350
It's never too late to take revenge.

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,790
Stop drinking.

47
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,580
Pull yourself together.

48
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,177
Or who'd take care of your men?

49
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,110
Give it back to me.

50
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,990
The wound isn't deep.

51
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,473
Your bones aren't injured.

52
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,390
Ruo Wen.

53
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,950
So, you gave me

54
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,790
all that you had.

55
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,790
What?

56
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,390
The token of Desert Rankers.

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,030
That's just scrap metal.

58
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,350
I don't care.

59
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,180
Since you give it to me,

60
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,860
I'll take it as my dowry.

61
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,470
If you like it,

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,910
keep it.

63
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,070
But...

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,300
It's such a big plan.

65
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,110
Why did you keep it from me?

66
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,180
You even expelled me.

67
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,030
If I died, I wanted you

68
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,030
to visit my grave.

69
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,140
Mr. Rong.

70
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,460
Mr. Rong Huo.

71
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,820
- Be careful.
- Young Lord.

72
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,860
You may rise.

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,500
Mr. Sha told me

74
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,300
what happened in Fentian.

75
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,620
Thank you for saving Rong An.

76
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,100
Mr. Rong Huo,

77
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
I owe him this.

78
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,220
When the time is right,

79
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
I'll arrange for you to meet him.

80
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,460
Thank you, Young Lord.

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,540
Rong An, my friend,

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,260
it's been 15 years and how time flies.

83
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,860
Now, we don't recognize each other.

84
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,180
Fifteen years ago,

85
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,220
to keep me alive,

86
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,340
Mr. Rong Ruo switched our identities

87
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,660
and kept me alive.

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,020
So, you lost your parents
and drifted for a life.

89
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,100
I feel rather guilty.

90
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,220
After Mr. Rong Huo escorted me to Tiandu,

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,020
he went missing.

92
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Luckily,

93
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,020
I've saved him.

94
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,220
For now, he lives in Tiandu.

95
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,460
Huo Qingyun asked me to give you this.

96
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,180
What does he mean?

97
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,900
Rong Ruo in this letter

98
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,052
is a trusted follower
of the late lord of Yunpei.

99
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,260
That year,

100
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,940
you didn't kill everyone.

101
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,740
I failed my job.

102
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,900
All these years, I didn't know

103
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,180
Ruo Wen, the bandit,

104
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,513
was the son of Rong Ruo.

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,580
Before it rains,

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,220
repair the roof

107
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,060
to prevent problems.

108
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,620
I get it, My Lord.

109
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,500
I'll dispatch ten thousand elite soldiers

110
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
to fight Fentian.

111
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,180
For this big invasion,

112
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,580
use the excuse

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,500
that Ruo Wen stole away my wife.

114
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,900
My Lord.

115
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,980
My Lord,

116
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,540
all tribes delivered letters

117
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,820
to express their condolences
to Lady Beishuang.

118
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,260
(Letter of Condolences)

119
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,620
How do they know this?

120
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
It's Huo Qingyun.

121
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,060
(To Lord of Yunpei)
He spread her death in the desert.

122
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,660
My Lord,

123
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,860
Her Ladyship's death

124
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,140
is a big deal of Yunpei.

125
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,860
We should get back her body

126
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,780
and have a grand funeral for her.

127
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,060
Seven days later,
she'll be buried in Genesis Tomb

128
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,900
for condolences.

129
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,860
If we fail this etiquette,

130
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,380
other tribes will laugh at us.

131
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,460
My Lord,

132
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,820
General Wu is right.

133
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,220
Think about it.

134
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,820
If Huang Beishuang is alive,

135
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,340
she has the secret of the Desert Scroll.

136
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,260
If such a wise woman

137
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,380
works for Huo Qingyun,

138
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,220
that will be worse

139
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,380
for our city.

140
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,860
I kind of hope

141
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,940
she's really dead.

142
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,140
Orders, My Lord.

143
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,180
Let's take back Her Ladyship's body.

144
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,340
Get her servants to me.

145
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,940
Yes.

146
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,900
Just like that,

147
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,140
Mother died in Sanjiang.

148
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,500
This is the only thing she left me.

149
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,860
I'd rather I didn't recall everything.

150
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,340
Rong Ruo and Na Qida
traveled in the desert for eight years.

151
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,900
Mother and I lived all alone

152
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,460
in Yunpei.

153
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,740
Only a few months after he returned,

154
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,340
we suffered that.

155
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Even in this case,

156
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,140
he's your father.

157
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,780
I'll never forgive him.

158
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,940
Then don't forgive him.

159
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,940
But anyway,

160
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,020
what's gone is gone.

161
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,780
I'll keep you company.

162
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,060
Let's live a peaceful life.

163
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,380
I can't let it go.

164
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,700
Na Zhan has to die.

165
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,740
What's your plan, then?

166
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,620
Na Zhan lives in Yunpei.

167
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
After this battle,

168
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,180
it's even harder

169
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,140
to kill him.

170
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,300
I'll get ready

171
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,140
to fight Yunpei.

172
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,220
I pledge my life

173
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,060
to take revenge.

174
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,460
All right.

175
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,220
Whether alive or dead,

176
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,860
I'll keep you company.

177
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,820
Never push me away again.

178
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,060
(Madwoman,)

179
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,900
(you have to live.)

180
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,460
- Get off me.
- No.

181
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,580
Get off me.

182
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,980
Try pushing me away again.

183
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,940
Try it.

184
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,460
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

185
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,300
For no reason,

186
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,900
Tiandu detains the body

187
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,860
of my wife.

188
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,780
Today,

189
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,900
you're going to Tiandu

190
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,100
to get back her body,

191
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,700
so it'll be buried in Genesis Tomb.

192
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,780
What do you say?

193
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,740
Yes.

194
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,540
This is Enaqi's soil.

195
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,140
It's what Beishuang gave me

196
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,620
at the wedding ceremony.

197
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
If she

198
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,940
gets over it alive,

199
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,300
the two of you

200
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,740
will take her back.

201
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,460
We won't let you down, My Lord.

202
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,460
(Fentian)

203
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,780
(Fentian)

204
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,060
Wolf,

205
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,780
is your life so valuable?

206
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,140
Chief hasn't moved at all.

207
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,820
Chief has nine lives.

208
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,100
I have only one.

209
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,100
I don't want to die yet.

210
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
Or it'll be worthless.

211
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,660
When you're destined to die,

212
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,020
you won't die earlier.

213
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,380
Look how scared you are.

214
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,500
Peed your pants, huh?

215
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,740
Don't laugh.

216
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,860
All of you.

217
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,020
Sit down.

218
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Such a big hole.

219
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,340
How's everything going

220
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,340
with the recruitment?

221
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,900
Fentian has had many collapses.

222
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,300
People keep complaining.

223
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,100
They either leave or run away.

224
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,580
Only some weak guys stay.

225
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,180
They refuse to join us.

226
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,420
Na Zhan is cunning.

227
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,180
He must have a complete plan

228
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,540
and want us to be defenseless.

229
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,380
No way.

230
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,700
We must do something.

231
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,460
Sinister as Na Zhan is,

232
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,380
he won't let go of Fentian.

233
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,100
Send our men to the border of Yunpei.

234
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,620
If they get anything, let me know.

235
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,780
Yes.

236
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,500
Lord Ruo Wen,

237
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,500
news from Boa Agents.

238
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,500
(Yunpei's troops
will arrive in five days.)

239
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,540
(Map of the Desert)
Fentian is located

240
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,140
between Tiandu and Yunpei.

241
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,820
It's where lords fight for.

242
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,780
If Fentian allies with us,

243
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,460
we will hold Na Zhan up.

244
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,300
Chief.

245
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,820
When many places in Fentian collapse,

246
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,660
Na Zhan wants an invasion.

247
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,500
(Collapses.)
Under such circumstances,

248
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,620
(Invasion.)
without our help,

249
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm afraid

250
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,767
they can't fight Yunpei armies.

251
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,340
I get it.

252
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,460
Do what you have to do.

253
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
Yes.

254
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,340
Young Lord, what is your plan?

255
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,780
Na Zhan is making such a big deal

256
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,420
just to get Na Yanxing.

257
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,113
Young Lord, are you planning to...?

258
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,820
He suffered too much for me.

259
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,420
I'll get Fentian

260
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,460
out of this trouble.

261
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,480
You're awake.

262
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,660
Come on. Get up.

263
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,380
How do you feel?

264
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,740
Anything wrong?

265
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,700
Where am I?

266
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,860
In Tiandu.

267
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,660
Don't worry.

268
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,580
You're safe.

269
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,260
Do you know how much I was worried?

270
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,100
Why can't you behave
like an ordinary girl?

271
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,820
You only think of me,

272
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,780
wait for me,

273
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,180
make three meals a day,

274
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,140
and feed the horse.

275
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,340
You're not an ordinary man.

276
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,660
Why do I have to be ordinary?

277
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,660
But anyway,

278
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,740
I'm safe.

279
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,780
What about Lianhuan and Yepei?

280
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,420
Don't worry.

281
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
They'll be all right.

282
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,820
Trust me.

283
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,620
Chief, Yepei and Lianhuan are here.

284
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,860
Lianhuan, Yepei,

285
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,820
why did you travel all the way

286
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,660
to Tiandu?

287
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,900
Your Lordship, we want to see Her Grace.

288
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,100
Get her up.

289
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,940
Your Grace.

290
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,580
Your Grace.

291
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,900
Your Grace.

292
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,860
Your Grace.

293
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,140
Your Grace.

294
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,380
Your Grace.

295
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,660
Let's go home.

296
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,220
It's empty?

297
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,740
Where is she?

298
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,060
Your Grace.

299
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,540
Your Grace.

300
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,980
I knew a great woman
like you would survive

301
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,940
and be all right.

302
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,220
Your Grace, I knew you could be blessed.

303
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
We just came here

304
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,500
to prove this.

305
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,340
Let me check on you.

306
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,540
Are you injured?

307
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,940
I'm all right.

308
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,967
Sorry to have kept you worried.

309
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,060
Did Na Zhan

310
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,100
give you a hard time?

311
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,780
Your Grace,

312
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
His Lordship asked us

313
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,380
to get you back.

314
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,380
I knew

315
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,060
he wouldn't let me go.

316
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,260
Your Grace,

317
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,500
you decide whether we return or not.

318
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,780
We don't want to see you
play the flute in the night

319
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,780
and guard the tree

320
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,140
all alone.

321
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,140
Your Grace, I know

322
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,140
your staying with your beloved man

323
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,900
can be the happiest thing in the world.

324
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,500
We'll return and report to His Lordship.

325
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,060
Hope everything's fine with you.

326
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,820
When the dust settles,

327
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,060
I'll get you to me.

328
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,060
Don't worry.

329
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,660
Unless I'm dead,

330
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,020
you won't suffer anymore.

331
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,940
(To the Lord of Yunpei)

332
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,700
Take the coffin back,

333
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,900
give it to Na Zhan,

334
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,567
and ask him to open it personally.

335
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,700
(Fengtian Pavilion)

336
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,700
My Lord,

337
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,220
Huo Qingyun asked you
to open it personally.

338
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,060
Open it.

339
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,980
Yes.

340
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,820
(To the Lord of Yunpei)

341
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,380
My Lord.

342
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,540
(To the Lord of Yunpei)

343
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,860
Luckily, Rong Huo told me all the truth.

344
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,460
I found the edict

345
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,740
hidden by my father Na Qida.

346
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,020
Unless you want everybody to know this,

347
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,980
you should announce

348
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,740
the death of the First Lady

349
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,260
and withdraw your troops from Fentian.

350
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,780
This letter is for you.

351
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Did you see Huang Beishuang's body?

352
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,060
The Lord of the North made a tombstone.

353
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,180
We bowed there.

354
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,060
Wu Jihai.

355
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,980
Here.

356
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,300
Tell everyone.

357
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,220
The First Lady of Yunpei

358
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,500
passed away.

359
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,260
My Lord,

360
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,060
I don't think this is convincing.

361
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,100
That year, you heard

362
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,780
Na Yanxing has a plum mark.

363
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,500
My Lord,

364
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,380
you're ill so weirdly.

365
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,460
It must be...

366
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,020
A wrong step

367
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,220
makes me lose the whole game.

368
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,780
Na Zhan is ferocious.

369
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,580
I'm too weak to fight him anymore.

370
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,100
My only wish

371
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,740
is to keep Yanxing alive.

372
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,420
Remember.

373
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,060
You must not let him
fall into Na Zhan's hands.

374
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,820
After I die,

375
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,940
the two of you

376
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,260
should take care of him.

377
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,140
When the time is right,

378
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,980
take out the edict

379
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,700
and let him take my throne.

380
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,140
The edict is...

381
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,180
Young Lord, Yanxing has had a plum mark

382
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,380
since he was born.

383
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,620
It can be his proof
as Young Lord of Yunpei.

384
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
The two old guys
played a trick in the beginning.

385
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,820
Truths and lies are hardly credible.

386
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,660
We can't leave it to luck.

387
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,860
What are you going to do next?

388
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,700
Accepting his offer
is just an stall tactic.

389
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,820
A delay brings trouble.

390
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,527
The longer it takes, the worse it'll be.

391
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,460
Get back our elite soldiers from Fentian

392
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,180
and defend our borders.

393
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,460
Yes.

394
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,580
Fortify the North Gate.

395
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,633
Send troops from the South Gate.

396
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,820
Such a terrible place.

397
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,980
You've been busy. Take some rest.

398
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,940
Fresh watermelon.

399
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,380
Here.

400
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,620
Madam, it tastes so sweet.

401
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,780
Chief,

402
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,767
Yunpei pulled back their soldiers.

403
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,260
- They did?
- Yes.

404
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,220
Na Zhan is a coward.

405
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,993
Before it starts, he's scared away.

406
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,780
And...

407
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,500
Finish it all at once.

408
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,820
Yunpei issued an obituary.

409
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,153
"Huang Beishuang is dead."

410
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,500
I get it.

411
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,540
Tell our men

412
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,020
to stay where they are

413
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,980
and remain alert.

414
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,020
Yes.

415
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,780
Chief, what's wrong?

416
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,820
Leave.

417
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,540
It's finally over.

418
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,247
Hope your mother can rest in peace

419
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,660
there in heaven.

420
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,860
Beishuang,

421
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
there's one more thing

422
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,060
I have to tell you.

423
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,780
I'm Na Yanxing, the son of Na Qida,

424
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,060
late lord of Yunpei.

425
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,660
I don't care what your name is,

426
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,673
Na Yanxing or Huo Qingyun.

427
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,060
All I want is you.

428
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,620
Come to Bingci Mansion for me.

429
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,380
I have a present for you.

430
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,660
"You're injured."

431
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,420
That's what you said to me first.

432
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,030
That day,

433
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,660
you gave me a sack of water
with your right hand.

434
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,260
The moment I got the water,

435
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,340
you sleeve

436
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,220
brushed my arm.

437
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,420
"Feita, have some water."

438
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,010
You smiled.

439
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,033
It's the first time I've seen your smile.

440
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,100
I...

441
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,500
I can't even forget now.

442
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,900
Maybe,

443
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,940
when I first met you,

444
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,580
I wanted you only.

445
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,820
Maybe I should prepare more

446
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,780
and spend half a month

447
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,380
making a grand wedding

448
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,020
for you.

449
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,300
But I can't wait.

450
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,560
I fear accidents.

451
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm afraid to lose you.

452
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,880
Huang Beishuang,

453
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,880
marry me.

454
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,760
Now.

455
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,320
(I,)

456
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,060
(Huo Qingyun...)

457
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,740
(I,)

458
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,060
(Huang Beishuang...)

459
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,980
(To wind...)

460
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,860
(To wind...)

461
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,360
(To the moon...)

462
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,220
(To the moon...)

463
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,900
(To snow, we swear.)

464
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,340
(Today,)

465
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,100
(we're married.)

466
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,540
(We'll spend our lives together)

467
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,780
(and never leave each other.)

468
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,620
(We'll spend our lives together)

469
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,673
(and never leave each other.)

470
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,780
(Father,)

471
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,940
(Mother,)

472
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,940
(he's Huo Qingyun.)

473
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
(My husband.)

474
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,020
(Father,)

475
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,900
(Mother,)

476
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,673
(I'll take good care of Beishuang.)

477
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,160
(I won't let her suffer)

478
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,060
(or get hurt again.)

479
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,650
(I'll protect her forever)

480
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,540
(and never leave her.)

481
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,100
(Forever and ever,)

482
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,020
(I will love her)

483
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,640
(and respect her.)
