=Episode 22=

24
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,510
Why are you back with a boy?

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
Chief,

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,180
this boy is weird.

27
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,580
He doesn't know why he's in the desert

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,140
or who his parents are.

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Give him something to eat
and throw him out.

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,780
Desert Rankers raise no kids.

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,140
I get it.

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,500
Don't raise me.

33
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,020
Give me something to eat.

34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,100
I can work.

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,900
What can you do?

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,180
Whatever you can do,

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,260
I can do it.

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,580
Is His Lordship back?

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,940
Your Grace, he was back last night.

40
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,020
Why didn't he come to me?

41
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,620
Wait a minute.

42
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,300
Come over.

43
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,780
What are you holding?

44
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,460
Did I miss something great?

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,460
Your Grace...

46
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,780
What? Why do you mumble?

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,860
It's the wedding dress.

48
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,300
His Lordship is getting married.

49
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,260
Wedding dress?

50
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,380
Getting married?

51
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,260
It's for me?

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,580
Let's go. Come on.

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,980
So, after what he suffered,

54
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,420
he's come around.

55
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,140
Ruo Wen.

56
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,620
Why did you not tell me

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,140
we'd get married?

58
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,100
It's so hasty.

59
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,500
What if

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,660
I don't like the dress you picked?

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,060
Does that

62
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,500
really matter?

63
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,940
Why does it not?

64
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,740
I'll get married

65
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,220
for only once in my life.

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,660
Everything has to be perfect.

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,260
Madwoman,

68
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,100
what are you thinking?

69
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,700
I'm thinking

70
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,740
you've finally figured out

71
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,340
who cares most for you in the world.

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,460
I'm going to marry Huang Beishuang.

73
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,820
None of your business.

74
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,900
You'll marry her?

75
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,020
Huo Qingyun won't let you!

76
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,140
This is Fentian.

77
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,380
He can't stop me!

78
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,860
Let me say it again.

79
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,380
I'm going to marry Huang Beishuang.

80
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,780
Do you understand?

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
Ruo Wen,

82
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,420
you're serious?

83
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,980
It's all right.

84
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,860
You'll still be the First Lady.

85
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,020
She's a mere concubine.

86
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,180
And I've always wanted

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,540
Huang Beishuang.

88
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,190
You know that very well, don't you?

89
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,900
When you were in a coma,

90
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,860
I kept you company without resting.

91
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,700
How could you do this to me?

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,940
Did I make you do that?

93
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,220
Satisfied?

94
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,100
Then get out of here!

95
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,860
Ruo Wen,

96
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,780
I thought after all this,

97
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,260
I could touch you,
however merciless you were.

98
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,220
You can't do that.

99
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,740
However long it takes.

100
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,660
In this world,

101
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,100
only Huang Beishuang
can get into my heart.

102
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,420
Do you understand?

103
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,460
This time,

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,940
I understand everything.

105
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
People live different lives.

106
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,260
You shouldn't only care for me.

107
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Go live your own life!

108
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,860
Beishuang.

109
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,660
Come in.

110
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,700
Are you done packing?

111
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,380
No. Wait a minute.

112
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,020
In Tiandu,

113
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,700
is there delicious food

114
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,860
or fun places?

115
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,820
There are snow mountains

116
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,220
and frozen lakes.

117
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,740
Beautiful and cold.

118
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,220
So, everywhere,

119
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,220
there are inns with hot sand pits.

120
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,580
The sand on the body

121
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,700
can soon disperse the chill.

122
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,460
Also,

123
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,940
sheep and cows in Tiandu

124
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,220
eat Cordyceps

125
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,740
and drink meltwater from snow mountains.

126
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,420
Sheep and cows growing up on salty soils

127
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,900
taste great without the smell of fish.

128
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,580
What else?

129
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,980
I won't tell you

130
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,780
until you get there.

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,900
Why do you keep me guessing?

132
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,460
What is this?

133
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,300
A pill made from Eternal Winter Grass.

134
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,760
It'll keep you asleep for seven days.

135
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,140
Even if you've been drinking the Spirit,

136
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,060
you can't wake up.

137
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,860
Why?

138
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,500
If I come back alive,

139
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,980
you take me to Tiandu

140
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,720
to enjoy the beautiful scenery.

141
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,620
By then,

142
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,860
I won't push you away anymore.

143
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,620
If I die,

144
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,700
forget me.

145
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,780
Armor.

146
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,060
I know.

147
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,820
I'll protect myself

148
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,540
and come back to you.

149
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,300
I told you my story.

150
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,580
Do you want to be the bait?

151
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,260
To Na Zhan,

152
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,540
I don't mean a lot.

153
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,900
A pompous man like him

154
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,940
greatly values the majesty of Yunpei

155
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,140
and his dignity.

156
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,660
If we want him to come to Fentian,

157
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,500
we have to utterly disgrace him.

158
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,500
The Lord of Fentian

159
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,580
forcibly marries
the First Lady of Yunpei.

160
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,620
What do you say?

161
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,740
Na Zhan has great martial arts.

162
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,300
On the wedding day,

163
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
as long as we kill his top guy Wu Jihai,

164
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,340
we will kill him, too.

165
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
I have one condition.

166
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,380
Speak.

167
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,940
Don't get Huo Qingyun involved.

168
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,020
To lure Na Zhan here,

169
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,500
we don't know if we can live.

170
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,460
If we succeed,

171
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
that'll be fine.

172
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,860
If we lose,

173
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,100
the desert will get into war.

174
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,180
If we keep him alive,

175
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,380
maybe

176
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,140
he can fight Na Zhan.

177
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
All right.

178
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,220
I approve.

179
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,780
I'll kick him away now.

180
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,980
That won't work.

181
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
In Fentian,

182
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,940
he trusts no one but me.

183
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,340
At the wedding, just cooperate with me.

184
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,220
I'll keep you safe.

185
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,380
All right.

186
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,940
I trust you.

187
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,780
(Fentian)

188
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,540
Chief.

189
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,780
Princess Xinwei

190
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,740
won't come back.

191
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
It's better that way.

192
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,780
Just in case,

193
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,900
send a squad

194
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,700
to secretly keep her safe.

195
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,260
My Lord,

196
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Ruo Wen of Fentian sent an invitation.

197
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,420
(Welcome to the wedding.)

198
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,940
(Groom: Ruo Wen, Bride: Huang Beishuang)

199
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,300
(Ruo Wen, Huang Beishuang)

200
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,420
Wedding?

201
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,540
Such an arrogant bandit.

202
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,380
I didn't fight him

203
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,780
and that was a complete honor.

204
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,220
Unexpectedly, he pushed his luck

205
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,620
and didn't know what he could really do.

206
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,700
My Lord,

207
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,380
will we send troops

208
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,860
against Fentian?

209
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,100
Are you trying to let everybody know

210
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,900
a bandit will marry my wife?

211
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,260
How disgraced I'll be!

212
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Calm down, My Lord.

213
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,300
It's inconsiderate of me.

214
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,420
Solve this problem immediately.

215
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,660
Do not delay.

216
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,220
Yes.

217
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,540
My Lord,

218
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,300
Ruo Wen is obviously

219
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,940
provoking our majesty.

220
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,460
The three cities reign over the desert

221
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,500
and it's settled.

222
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,260
I wonder if he colludes with Tiandu

223
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,780
to make trouble.

224
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,260
What you said

225
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,140
makes sense.

226
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,260
In my opinion,

227
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,780
to put this to rest

228
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,660
and asset our majesty,

229
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,780
you have to go.

230
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,260
I'll lead ten thousand elite soldiers

231
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
to go with you.

232
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,380
During this trip,

233
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,820
whether we take back Huang Beishuang,

234
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,100
Ruo Wen

235
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,340
has to be killed.

236
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,820
If anything unexpected happens...

237
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,180
I get it, My Lord.

238
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,300
Chief,

239
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,380
scouts reported

240
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,900
Na Zhan and his men reached our border.

241
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,540
They'll arrive tomorrow.

242
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,500
However,

243
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,260
he has taken a thousand soldiers.

244
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,220
We have to be alert.

245
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,380
It doesn't matter.

246
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,510
We just need to capture Na Zhan.

247
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,420
(Huang Beishuang,)

248
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,340
(what on earth will you do?)

249
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,420
My Lord,

250
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,020
I've sent death warriors into town.

251
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,020
They wait for the signal
in different places

252
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,260
to set off the gunpowder
to make collapses.

253
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,740
Got it.

254
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,500
I've arranged all our elite soldiers

255
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,860
around Fentian

256
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,780
just in case.

257
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,140
When we're in town, follow my lead!

258
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,020
Yes, My Lord.

259
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,220
(Tea)

260
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,060
Chief gave the money

261
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,500
for your traveling.

262
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,780
Keep it

263
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,740
and don't come back.

264
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,420
Want to send me away

265
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,100
with this little money?

266
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,460
Go back and tell him.

267
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,940
He can never repay

268
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,540
what he owes me.

269
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,940
And tell him.

270
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Ask him to be my slave

271
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,940
and serve me very well

272
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,460
in his afterlife.

273
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,900
It's hard to find a crippled toad.

274
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,780
But men are everywhere.

275
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,980
Even a random man

276
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,740
can be a hundred times better than him.

277
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
Even if he comes back to me,

278
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,580
I won't look at him again.

279
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,580
I don't care if you want it.

280
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,260
Anyway, I've brought you out.

281
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,220
Remember.

282
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,540
Never return to Fentian.

283
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,980
Chief doesn't like you at all.

284
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,140
He doesn't want to see you.

285
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,100
He gave out an order.

286
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,420
If you return to Fentian,

287
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,020
you'll be executed.

288
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,140
Executed?

289
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,460
(Desert Rankers)
Executed!

290
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,780
The token of Desert Rankers?

291
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,000
(Desert Rankers)
Why did he give me this?

292
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,540
Sir,

293
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,500
some wine, please.

294
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,500
We offer tea, no wine.

295
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,820
Some tea, please.

296
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,220
The tea that can get me drunk.

297
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,820
Miss,

298
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,660
after you finish the tea, go home.

299
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,020
Don't wander around here.

300
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,300
You must not go to Fentian.

301
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,220
I'll go wherever I want.

302
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
None of your business.

303
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,860
Fentian?

304
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,220
I don't want to go there!

305
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,100
Glad you won't go.

306
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,460
I have to close, too.

307
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,700
Or if there's a fight,

308
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,700
I can't run away.

309
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,020
What fight?

310
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,340
Now, people in Fentian

311
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,700
can't help panicking.

312
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,020
I heard the Lord of Fentian

313
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,860
wanted to forcibly marry
the Lady of Yunpei.

314
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,420
In a fit of anger, the Lord of Yunpei

315
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,300
came to Fentian with his troops.

316
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,940
Maybe they'll fight soon.

317
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,380
Na Zhan is here?

318
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,020
Good. Because you're obsessed,

319
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,220
you're in trouble, huh?

320
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,020
(Desert Rankers)

321
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,700
(People live different lives.)

322
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,220
(You shouldn't only care for me.)

323
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,780
(Go live your own life!)

324
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,820
Oh, no.

325
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,300
(Blockhouse)

326
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,140
Sha Qu.

327
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,780
Your Grace?

328
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,180
What are you doing here?

329
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,940
Long story. Never mind.

330
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,460
Did you see my chief?

331
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,180
He's out of contact for days.

332
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,380
Ruo Wen is behind it.

333
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,300
Maybe he's grounded by Ruo Wen.

334
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,020
Hurry. Take me back to Fentian.

335
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,900
Ruo Wen is in danger.

336
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,860
All right.

337
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,860
(Fentian)

338
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:41,260
(Clothing Shop)

339
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,580
Why don't we get in yet?

340
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,620
Be patient.

341
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,820
Inside Fentian,

342
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
I've arranged Boa Agents.

343
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,500
Not until they get some intel.

344
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,660
What?

345
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,960
When Fentian is just built,

346
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,300
you've planted spies?

347
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,660
Are those

348
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,140
your native people?

349
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,340
So many people are here.

350
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,900
How can I recognize every one of them?

351
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,860
But anyway,

352
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,900
they're dressed like natives.

353
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,420
No.

354
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Look how they walk.

355
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,500
They're trained soldiers.

356
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,500
I'll go check.

357
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,100
Mr. Sha.

358
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,710
Mr. Sha.

359
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,580
What?

360
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,620
Have you found Chief?

361
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,660
Yes. We're ready to move.

362
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,660
All right. Let's move now.

363
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,700
One more thing.

364
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,300
News came from the south

365
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,620
that a suspicious man

366
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,820
was carrying gunpowder.

367
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,340
After we found him,

368
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,420
he failed to set it off

369
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,300
and then killed himself.

370
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,300
Gunpowder?

371
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,580
Oh, no. Do they work for Na Zhan?

372
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,300
Those guys.

373
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,360
There must be a lot of them.

374
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,940
Looks like

375
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,900
Fentian

376
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,100
will be chaotic.

377
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,860
Tell our men

378
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,180
to stay alert

379
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,500
and search the city.

380
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,940
If they see more death warriors,

381
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
deal with them.

382
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,340
Yes.

383
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,180
Chief.

384
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,180
Chief.

385
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,340
Guards out there were chloroformed.

386
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,300
Are you all right?

387
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,940
I'm fine.

388
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,860
Poisoned by the Eternal Winter Grass,

389
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,100
my senses were lost.

390
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,820
I forcibly released myself.

391
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,780
Where's Huang Beishuang?

392
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,900
The Council Room is grandly decorated.

393
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,020
- Looks...
- Stop it.

394
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,740
Will you really let them get married?

395
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,380
Let's go.

396
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,150
There's another emergency.

397
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,300
I suspect Na Zhan arranged death warriors

398
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,900
everywhere in Feitian with gunpowder

399
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,060
to ruin this city.

400
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,380
Fentian has a special terrain.

401
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,540
Once many places are blown up,

402
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,660
there will be collapses.

403
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,020
I've sent men to search.

404
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,100
Just in case,

405
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,940
have our men evacuate the civilians.

406
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,340
All right.

407
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,780
- Let's go.
- Go.

It is the right time.

442
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,980
Don't blame me, Chief Ruo Wen.

443
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm late.

444
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,540
Say it again.

445
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,820
He's now the Lord of Fentian.

446
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,340
I've heard a lot

447
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,620
about Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers.

448
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,900
When you were in Yunpei,

449
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,020
I didn't entertain you.

450
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,300
My bad.

451
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,700
It doesn't matter.

452
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,260
I'd like to thank you, Na Zhan,

453
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,620
for the weapons you gave me.

454
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,380
Those weapons

455
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,260
are nothing to my city.

456
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,300
If you like them,

457
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,860
there are many weapons outside the city.

458
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,380
If you dare,

459
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
I'll give them to you.

460
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,540
Lords,

461
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,340
it's a big day.

462
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,940
Let's not talk about this.

463
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,300
Yeah.

464
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,060
Let's not talk about it.

465
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,780
Let me

466
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,540
introduce an acquaintance.

467
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,460
This is my new wife.

468
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,220
Oh, I forgot.

469
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,140
You two are familiar.

470
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,580
How daring!

471
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,660
How dare you marry the Lady of Yunpei?

472
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,700
Hold still.

473
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,580
Don't spoil the wedding.

474
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,860
Ruo Wen,

475
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,460
you haven't been a lord for long.

476
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,500
Before you stay steady
or settle everything,

477
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,220
you rush to make enemies.

478
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,660
Quite ambitious.

479
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,260
Without ambitions,

480
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,940
how can I fight you?

481
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,740
Beishuang,

482
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,580
I'm late.

483
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,140
I'm here to take you back.

484
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,020
Na Zhan,

485
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,020
you supported Ge'er Jinqin

486
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,740
to usurp power and kill my father.

487
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,620
You also got my mother killed in Tiandu.

488
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,300
Want me to go back with you?

489
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,500
Lord Na Zhan,

490
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
did you hear?

491
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,140
She's willing to marry me.

492
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,300
In this case,

493
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,020
please don't hold us up

494
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,100
for our great wedding time.

495
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,660
Since you're here,

496
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,740
I'd like to invite you

497
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,260
to throw the holy water

498
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,140
and wish us a long happy life.

499
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,160
- What do you say?
- Ruo Wen!

500
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,900
Move!

501
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,620
Kill!

502
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,420
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

503
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,740
Ruo Wen.

504
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,580
Ruo Wen, watch out!

505
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,660
Chief!

506
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,420
Madwoman, why are you back?

507
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,380
To die with you.

508
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,140
Are you all right?

509
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm fine.

510
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,740
Don't act alone again.

511
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,460
Let me check.

512
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
I've been looking for you for 15 years.

513
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,660
I didn't know you were still alive.

514
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,740
You aren't dead.

515
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,820
I have to live.

516
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,860
Since you're all here,

517
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,420
die with him.

518
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,740
Have a death wish?

519
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,500
Be obedient.

520
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,500
I'd like to see

521
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,740
if you can kill me.

522
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,780
Stop!

523
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,180
Huang Beishuang!

524
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,220
Beishuang.

525
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,780
Beishuang.

526
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,980
Don't come over.

527
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,900
