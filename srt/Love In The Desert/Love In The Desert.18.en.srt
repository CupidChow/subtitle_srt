What do you want to do?

What can I do?

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,910
Why do you yell?

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,030
You messed with me.

28
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,310
Leave right away.

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,420
I want some sleep.

30
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,150
Don't stay in my room.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,830
I won't leave. You bullied me.

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,790
What? Angry?

33
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,090
You promised

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,870
to do three things for me.

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,260
I...

36
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,420
Did I?

37
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,790
Very well.

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,140
You're a great man

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,990
and terrorize the desert.

40
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,230
If you want to regret it,

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,860
what can I do?

42
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,110
Don't provoke me.

43
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,430
I want Masui.

44
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,310
What for?

45
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,070
This is my home.

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,140
I'm the Ninth Princess of Masui.

47
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,950
I deserve this city.

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,550
Drop the act.

49
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,390
Ge'er Jinqin doesn't know you.

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,700
Then listen.

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,510
This city

52
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,950
means nothing to Huang Beishuang.

53
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,550
Do you know what I was
thinking the whole night?

54
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,580
I do, of course.

55
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,110
Actually, I wanted to tell you.

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,950
I'm the princess of Enaqi.

57
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,740
She's the Ninth Princess of Masui

58
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,830
who married Na Zhan for me.

59
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,110
Masui is what she hates most.

60
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,670
She gave up being the princess.

61
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,110
Do you think she'll want this city?

62
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,180
Give the city to me.

63
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,740
You'll keep your promise

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,580
and we'll have our own home.

65
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,230
We'll stay in Masui

66
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,700
and live a sweet life together.

67
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,950
In your dreams.

68
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,830
You're insane, indeed.

69
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,620
I want to be free,

70
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,550
but I want a home, too.

71
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,860
I've known you for such a long time.

72
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,300
We remain adrift without settling down.

73
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,070
But that's the best time of my life.

74
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,190
From now on,

75
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,700
wherever you are,

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,670
where my home will be.

77
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,550
Chief, you're awake?

78
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,750
Come on.

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,710
Sorry, Chief.

80
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,470
You're hunted for in Yunpei.

81
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,500
Without permission,

82
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,840
I took you back to Tiandu.

83
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,670
Weren't you waiting
for Miss Beishuang in Juyun Pavilion?

84
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,630
How come you...?

85
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,620
She knew everything.

86
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,310
Just as I expected.

87
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,260
I didn't know

88
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,710
she could be so heartless.

89
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,110
The stab on the right

90
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,910
nearly wounded your vitals.

91
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,230
She tried to stab your left vitals, too.

92
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,350
Without the armor,

93
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,030
I'm afraid you would be dead.

94
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,150
I owe her this.

95
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,220
Where's my armor?

96
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,070
I dumped it.

97
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,140
She doesn't care for you.

98
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,030
Why do you keep it to make yourself sad?

99
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,830
Get it back.

100
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,470
I got her mother killed.

101
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,110
And I deceived her.

102
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,670
It is normal

103
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,020
that she hates me.

104
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,620
Young Lord.

105
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,230
Young Lord, what happened?

106
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,940
Young Lord, don't get up

107
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,620
in case your wounds rupture.

108
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,030
Sha Qu, leave us.

109
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,660
Mr. Rong Huo,

110
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,670
you had a long trip.

111
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,700
It must be a hard time.

112
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,940
It doesn't matter.

113
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,260
But it's been 15 years.

114
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,500
Revisiting this city

115
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,470
brings up a lot of feelings.

116
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,660
Mr. Rong Huo,

117
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,790
I have some confusion.

118
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,230
Since my mother

119
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,820
is Princess Hua Ming of Tiandu,

120
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,990
why does no one know about me

121
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,590
in Yunpei or Tiandu?

122
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,550
Back then,

123
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,420
my brother and I followed the late lord

124
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,380
to travel around the desert.

125
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,080
We were in danger during the trip.

126
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,030
Luckily, Princess Hua Ming saved us.

127
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,990
She had great martial arts

128
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,710
and wanted to spread
medical skills all over the desert.

129
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,940
Then we traveled together.

130
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,430
After that,

131
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,150
she and the late lord fell in love.

132
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,990
They had planned

133
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,380
to complete the Desert Scroll

134
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,910
and returned to Yunpei

135
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,790
for the wedding ceremony.

136
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,820
But when she gave birth to you,

137
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,670
she died of difficult labor.

138
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,790
Her dying wish

139
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,300
was to keep you away
from the conflict in Yunpei.

140
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,900
But...

141
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,180
Things are going athwart.

142
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,990
I don't mean to start a war.

143
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,540
Nor do I want to change

144
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,500
Yunpei's territory for 30 years.

145
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,260
But without the real edict,

146
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,670
how can we possibly

147
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,830
topple Na Zhan?

148
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,710
Young Lord, Young Lord.

149
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,550
I understand.

150
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,420
I totally do.

151
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,230
But

152
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,740
there are limited places to live.

153
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,420
The superior guys take fertile lands.

154
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,790
The inferior guys take remote lands.

155
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,590
Since Na Zhan took the throne,

156
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,990
he's been like a bloodsucking leech.

157
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,300
He's snatched more abundant resources

158
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,590
to strengthen himself.

159
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,820
But he has made

160
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,230
many weak tribes

161
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,060
scattered all over the desert.

162
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,300
Countless people in the north desert

163
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,990
have lost their homes

164
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,110
and they're in grave danger.

165
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,590
What do I do?

166
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,540
Young Lord,

167
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,900
when we have to start a war...

168
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,220
Young Lord,

169
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,860
don't be afraid of losing lives.

170
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,710
(On the oasis,)

171
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,860
(you'll take Enaqi people and me)

172
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,070
(to sow the first seed.)

173
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,990
(Brick by brick,)

174
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,860
(we'll build our own house)

175
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,660
(and embrace the first wisp of smoke.)

176
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,620
(We'll hear)

177
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,110
(the baby's first cry.)

178
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,670
Your Grace,

179
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,950
you didn't sleep all day and night.

180
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,260
You had nothing to eat, too.

181
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,260
If you go on like this,

182
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,070
what if you break down?

183
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,310
General Wu,

184
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,470
what do you think of Yunpei

185
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,660
compared to what it was

186
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,270
under my father's reign?

187
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,740
The three cities used to be
as powerful as each other.

188
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,830
But now, Yunpei is dominant.

189
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,540
My Lord, you spent only 15 years

190
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,950
to have turned Yunpei

191
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,950
from a terrifying city

192
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,380
to a wonderland.

193
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,990
But Rong Huo

194
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,540
acknowledges lineages

195
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
and natural laws.

196
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,780
What do they actually matter?

197
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,020
The throne of Yunpei

198
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,900
belongs to a strong man.

199
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,310
My Lord,

200
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,860
times have changed.

201
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,140
Even if Na Yanxing survived,

202
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,380
he'd just be nobody.

203
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,150
I got a letter from Tiandu.

204
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,740
Huo Qingyun is back there alive.

205
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,190
Rong Huo is also

206
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,230
securely guarded by him.

207
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,190
It's my fault.

208
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,230
I let big trouble get away.

209
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,230
Forget it.

210
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,340
Forget it.

211
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,260
Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers took Masui

212
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,310
within such a short time.

213
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,710
Don't you find it fishy?

214
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,140
Maybe

215
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,660
Huo Qingyun helped him.

216
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,830
Write to our spy in Tiandu,

217
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,470
asking him to bide his time.

218
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,430
Yes.

219
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,580
Wait.

220
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,260
Masui was broken into.

221
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,260
The north desert is in chaos.

222
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,710
Write to the Guhe Tribe,

223
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,520
asking them to do something.

224
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,470
(In the 344th year,)

225
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,900
(Masui was annihilated.)

226
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,990
(Lord Ruo Wen took the throne.)

227
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,190
(Cheng'en Pavilion)
(Desert Rankers became city guards.)

228
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,800
(Desert Rankers)
(The new city)

229
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,070
(was Fentian.)

230
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,500
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

231
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,860
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

232
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,790
Mr. Rong Huo,

233
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,950
Fentian is built.

234
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,900
So, Ruo Wen isn't just a nobody.

235
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,260
That's why I think highly of him.

236
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,310
But...

237
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,660
The war has started.

238
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,660
It will hardly wind down.

239
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,620
Chief,

240
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,190
Fentian is built.

241
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,470
Nearby bandits all moved to the north.

242
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,350
The north desert is chaotic.

243
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,830
Lord of Guhe suddenly ordered

244
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,260
to besiege Enaqi.

245
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,070
They cut the water source

246
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,430
to force Enaqi people
to turn in their oasis.

247
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,790
Within three days,

248
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,110
more than a hundred died.

249
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,350
Enaqi?

250
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,350
If it continues,

251
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,190
Enaqi can't resist soon.

252
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,780
(The Enaqi Tribe)

253
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,880
(The Guhe Tribe)
Looks like

254
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,380
Na Zhan is behind this.

255
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,310
Chief, what do we do now?

256
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,350
How many men do they have?

257
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,660
More than 5,000.

258
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,110
What about Boa Agents?

259
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,860
Now, we can only assemble a hundred.

260
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,540
Most of our men are standing by in different tribes.

261
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,990
Even if we gather all of them,

262
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,190
we'll have only a thousand.

263
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,270
And it takes five days to summon them.

264
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
(Yunfang Pavilion)

265
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,380
Bad news, Your Grace.

266
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,990
Guhe has besieged Enaqi.

267
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,430
I get it.

268
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,620
Leave me alone.

269
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,830
But...

270
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,020
- Your Grace.
- Prepare a warm bath.

271
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,950
Get me a meal, too.

272
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,620
That's great.

273
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
You've figured it out.

274
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,620
I'm on it now.

275
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,670
Your Grace.

276
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,540
Lianhuan, go prepare a meal.

277
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,780
OK. I'm on it.

278
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,380
Lady Beishuang,

279
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,630
His Lordship is taking a nap.

280
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,070
It's all right. I'm not an outsider.

281
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,910
But...

282
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,740
It's been some days.

283
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,220
Lady Beishuang,

284
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,070
you've lost weight.

285
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,870
I appreciate your concern, My Lord.

286
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,830
Tell me.

287
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,980
What do you want?

288
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,780
When I killed Huo Qingyun,

289
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,380
you promised to reward me.

290
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,950
Do you remember?

291
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,150
Yes, of course.

292
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,270
Anyone meritorious

293
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,580
deserves a reward.

294
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,740
I want to be the First Lady of Yunpei.

295
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,270
Lady Beishuang,

296
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,660
isn't it too much?

297
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,470
Besides, Huo Qingyun is lucky.

298
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,230
He's survived.

299
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,920
He's evil.

300
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,230
How did he survive two stabs?

301
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,420
I should have stabbed harder.

302
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,070
Since you hate him so much,

303
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,950
how about I lend you a hand

304
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,110
and put an end to your enmity?

305
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,660
Thank you for killing my enemy.

306
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,070
We're a family, after all.

307
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,900
I can make you the First Lady.

308
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,780
But do you know

309
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,310
what it means?

310
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,950
A more unbreakable alliance.

311
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,950
One day,

312
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,350
when you unify the desert,

313
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,430
I'll be the most honorable lady.

314
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,310
It's wise of you.

315
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,900
One more thing.

316
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,230
Don't bother to say it.

317
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,900
Enaqi is in trouble.

318
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,870
I won't turn a deaf ear.

319
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,430
Thank you, My Lord.

320
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,990
Please migrate Enaqi people

321
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,260
to the south desert.

322
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,630
Greetings, Brother.

323
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,950
Qingyun, there you are.

324
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,990
Greetings, Your Lordship.

325
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,430
You can take your sword in.

326
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,300
We're brothers.

327
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,310
But you're the Lord of the city.

328
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,270
Rules are rules.

329
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Brother, I'm here

330
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,710
to discuss something.

331
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,260
I heard about it.

332
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,150
But Enaqi is a tiny tribe.

333
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,470
What does it have to do with us?

334
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,230
Nearby tribes, big or small,

335
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,060
are what we need to unite with.

336
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,150
We only need
thousands of soldiers to aid Enaqi.

337
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,390
It won't hurt our power.

338
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,540
Tiandu isn't open to the public yet.

339
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,670
If we send reinforcements

340
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,340
and expose our strengths,

341
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,990
that'd be inappropriate.

342
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,870
In the eyes of everyone,

343
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,710
Boa Agents and Tiandu are mysterious.

344
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,870
If we obfuscate it
in the name of Boa Agents,

345
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,020
we won't reveal our strength.

346
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,710
Secrets never keep long.

347
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,060
What if...?

348
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,900
Brother,

349
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,670
you don't trust me, huh?

350
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,540
But I heard

351
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,580
the princess of Enaqi
is Na Zhan's concubine.

352
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,260
You're well-informed.

353
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,820
That's even more inappropriate.

354
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,580
Why would we interfere with Yunpei?

355
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,430
It makes sense, My Lord.

356
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,870
Maybe Na Zhan has sent reinforcements.

357
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,900
Qingyun,

358
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,340
in this case,

359
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,910
I can't let you do what you want.

360
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,190
What if I insist?

361
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,060
You have the commander's seal.

362
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,630
But I have to remind you.

363
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,740
You sent Sha Qu to steal the ice toad.

364
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,500
So far, only I'm aware.

365
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,390
If you insist on sending reinforcements,

366
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,580
the ice toad thing

367
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,710
won't be kept secret anymore.

368
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,990
It's the treasure of our city.

369
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,020
Stealing it is a felony.

370
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,670
According to our law,

371
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,500
you'll take 200 lashes.

372
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,790
For stealing the ice toad,

373
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,990
you can punish me by law.

374
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,350
But I've made up my mind

375
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,900
to send reinforcements.

376
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,860
Your Lordship,

377
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,340
nearly no one has survived 200 lashes.

378
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,180
You...

379
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,510
Qingyun,

380
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,190
I'm asking you one last time.

381
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,630
Have you made up your mind?

382
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,830
I'm ready

383
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,540
for my punishment.

384
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,710
Your Grace,

385
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,630
after the ceremony is over tomorrow,

386
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,780
His Lordship will
send reinforcements to Enaqi.

387
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,630
You don't need to worry.

388
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,820
Masui is ruined.
The north desert is chaotic.

389
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,630
That's why Enaqi is invaded.

390
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,540
I'm to blame for this.

391
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,670
Your Grace, you've done pretty well.

392
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,870
After today,

393
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,910
you'll be the First Lady tomorrow.

394
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,910
Enaqi will be saved.

395
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,470
It will be protected, too.

396
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,150
Since you hate him so much,

397
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,150
how about I lend you a hand

398
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,060
and put an end to your enmity?

399
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,020
Go with me.

400
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,510
Don't touch me!

401
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,940
After you're out of here,

402
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,150
you can cut me into pieces.

I had my first woman.

455
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,100
She was Lady Shu.

456

For the first time, she didn't surrender.

460
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,230
Then we had it again and again

461
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,020
until she had eyes only for me.

462
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,710
You have her temper.

463
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,670
But I heard

464
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,230
you discarded her long ago.

465
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,950

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,060
Maybe

467
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,060
I should win you over in the same way.

468
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,300
But I'll end up differently.

469
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,710
I won't be your wife,

470
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,780
your pawn,

471
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,910
or your partner.

472
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,020
If you don't come up here,

473
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,540

474
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,100
But you can't kill me

475
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,500
until I find out the secret
in the Desert Scroll

476
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,030
and help you take the other two cities.

477
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,950
You think you can read my mind?

478
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,750
My Lord,

479
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,780
I am a pawn.

480
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,100
You decide

481
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,020
where you put me.

482
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,060
I know you don't love me.

483
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,430
Then put me

484
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,780
where I'm supposed to be.

485
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,990
How do you know I don't love you?

486
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,820
I knew you were engaged to him.

487
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,870
I just didn't know

488
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,150
you would abandon him
and come to Yunpei alone.

489
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,990
Wherever I put you,

490
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,060
I can control him and Tiandu.

491
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,950
Tell me.

492
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,580
How is this move?

493
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,300
Huang Beishuang,

494
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,470
since you want me to protect Enaqi,

495
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,190
then loyally kneel at my feet like this

496
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,030
the whole night.

497
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,660
Until

498
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,870
the day breaks tomorrow.

499
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,270
Chief,

500
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,230
you're awake?

501
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,750
Any message

502
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,230
from General Wei?

503
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,670
He's riding to aid Enaqi at top speed.

504
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,740
You'd better worry about yourself.

505
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,300
Just get to the point.

506
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,660
The day before yesterday,

507
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,230
Lady Beishuang was made

508
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,100
the First Lady of Yunpei.

509
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,910
Anything else?

510
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,100
Get out of the way.

511
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,390
The Lord sent me to see Lord Qingyun.

512
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,950
Without permission,

513
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,900
no one can get in.

514
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,280
His Lordship isn't dead yet.

515
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,430
Why do you rush to confirm?

516
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,340
The Lord asked me
to bring the best healing powder.

517
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,500
Hope Lord Qingyun will get well soon.

518
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,350
It won't help at all.

519
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,470
He's too badly wounded.

520
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,710
He can't stop bleeding.

521
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
If he keeps losing too much blood,

522
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,340
I'm afraid he can't live.

523
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,020
What? What do we do?

524
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,990
Everything in Tiandu

525
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,500
relies on His Lordship.

526
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,580
We appreciate it.

527
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,500
But I have something important to do.

528
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,340
See you, sir!

529
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,670
Did you mean all that stuff?

530
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,230
I saw it with my own eyes.

531
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,990
Lord Qingyun was lying there

532
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,340
and not moving at all.

533
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,100
Do you suspect anything?

534
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,670
Don't worry, My Lord.

535
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,990
Even physicians can't
recognize the poison on the whip.

536
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,390
Nobody would know anything.

537
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,300
Huo Qingyun,

538
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,670
you asked for this.

539
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,260
I just pushed you.

Huo Qingyun is in a coma.)

544
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,670

545
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,540
200 lashes?

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,990
as far as I remember,

548
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,470
very few people could survive

549

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,060

00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,620
Look at this.

568
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,510
All right.

569
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,500
Come take a look.

570
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,340
Sir,

571
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,510
how's your business?

572
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,990
Since Masui had a new ruler,

573
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,460
many people have come out shopping.

574
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,820
But few of them buy anything.

575
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,990
How do you think my business is?

576
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,230
Don't talk nonsense.

577
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,100
What does it have to do

578
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,780
with the new ruler?

579
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,390
The new lord

580
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,500
is a thousand times better

581
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,990
than fatuous Ge'er Jinqin.

582
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,710
Miss, you have no idea.

583
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,630
Do you know

584
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,780
who the new lord is?

585
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,910
A bandit who kills people impulsively.

586
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,670
Yeah. He's a bandit.

587
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,500
- You...
- He can't govern a city.

588
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,780
He does all kinds of evil things.

589
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,150
It'll bring retribution to Masui.

590
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,060
Such a catastrophe.

591
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,550
I know you have a tongue, all right?

592
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,230
You've never been helpful

593
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,380
in constructing Fentian.

594
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,020
You're quite sarcastic, though.

595
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,340
What...

596
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,470
Did he ruin the city?

597
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,190
Did he burn your house

598
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,150
or did he rob you?

599
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,230
Without harsh taxes,
people live a good life.

600
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,980
You're still unsatisfied!

601
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,230
Pack up everything and deliver it

602
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,580
to the Lord's mansion.

603
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,030
Ev... Everything?

604
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,420
He'll buy everything.

605
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,380
Thank you, sir.

606
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,060
It's so nice of him.

607
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,020
Wait for me.

608
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,110
It's generous of him.

609
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,020
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

610
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,060
They don't know you.

611
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,300
So, they misunderstand you.

612
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Don't take it personally.

613
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,470
I won't take it personally.

614
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,470
As time goes by, they will know

615
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,950
you're a very good lord

616
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,430
who is wise and loving.

617
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,260
I can expel those who don't want to stay.

618
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,740
Then why did you buy his goods?

619
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,390
With a dagger, I would have killed them.

620
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,300
You just deny it.

621
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,190
But I understand.

622
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,660
You care for people in Fentian.

623
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
You also

624
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,430
care for me.

625
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,940
When will you marry me as you promised?

626
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,660
I want a grand wedding.

627
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,950
The best ritual masters will be hired.

628
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,310
In front of all Desert Rankers,

629
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,750
I'll accept the blessing
from the Goddess of Fire.

630
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,710
Oh,

631
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,870
you'll dip the willow branch in water

632
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,310
and touch my forehead with it.

633
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,950
Only in this way can we love forever

634
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,790
with great fortune.

635
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,980
Even thinking of such a wonderful life

636
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,830
makes me happy.

637
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,940
Cheers.

638
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,390
I'll pick my own wedding dress.

639
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,700
Come take a look. Fancy wine.

640
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,270
Come take a look.

641
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,580
Sir, taste it.

642
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,870
It smells great. Taste it.

643
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,630
Come on.

644
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,750
(Wine)
Great flavor.

645
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,060
Then, taste this.

646
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,380
How does it taste?

647
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
This one is good, huh?

648
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,990
Thank you, sir.

649
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:55,500
(Clothing Shop)

650
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,330
What's up?

651
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,190
What's the rush?

652
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,580
Fentian is built.

653
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,100
We have our own home.

654
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,540
To live with me, you should be decent.

655
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,950
Don't be a sloppy bandit anymore.

656
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,830
So, I had the best tailor in Fentian

657
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,020
to make you some clothes.

658
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,060
Try them on.

659
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,830
Who'd live with you?

660
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,390
I don't want them. Dump them.

661
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,710
No way.

662
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,990
I've never been so serious before.

663
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,540
It's just you.

664
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,790
If it were someone else,

665
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,020
I wouldn't take care of him.

666
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,580
Don't take care of me.

667
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,540
Will you try them on?

668
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,580
You know I hate...

669
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,310
I know.

670
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,580
Break the rule just this once, huh?

671
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,380
Fine.

672
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,950
How did you get this scar?

673
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,270
I don't know.

674
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,940
Why do you not know anything?

675
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,740
You have scars all over.

676
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,020
Ruo Wen.

677
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,580
What is wrong?

678
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,340
Are you all right?

679
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,460
Yes.

680
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,060
You overacted and scared me.

681
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,310
You slept poorly, I guess.

682
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,990
Tonight,

683
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,140
I'll help you relax.

684
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,060
Chief!

685
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,500
Chief.

686
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,860
What's up?

687
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,870
The Guhe Tribe robbed Enaqi.

688
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,220
Na Zhan and Tiandu sent soldiers.

689
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,220
Why did Tiandu do that?

690
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,500
I get it.

691
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,670
Watch them closely.

692
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,750
Yes.

693
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,140
What I told you this morning,

694
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,990
have you decided?

695
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,990
- What is it?
- The wedding.

696
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,270
I haven't.

697
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,910
Darn it.

698
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,390
Then why did you take away the clothes?

699
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,790
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

700
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,540
You may rise.

701
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,580
I know your mother died.

702
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,060
I'm sorry for your loss.

703
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,350
But death is irreversible.

704
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,390
My condolences.

705
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,420
My Lord,

706
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,060
thanks to you,

707
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,100
my mother was buried.

708
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,140
You helped me

709
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,310
and I will

710
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,990
always remember that.

711
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,660
Get up. Hurry.

712
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
You know what?

713
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,020
After your mother died,

714
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,390
I asked General Wu to check the site.

715
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,470
There, he found this.

716
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,140
I guess

717
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,950
it's from the murderer.

718
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,950
Maybe it's useful to you.

719
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,830
Boa Agents?

720
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,790
Someone broke in a few days ago.

721
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,470
The head of Boa Agents,

722
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Huo Qingyun.

723
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,060
Yes.

724
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,060
He met me before the banquet.

725
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,430
He threatened me with my mother.

726
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,620
So, he killed my mother!

727
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,020
Huo Qingyun

728
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,310
is the Lord of the North.

729
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,060
He lives in Bingci Mansion, Tiandu.

730
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,620
You can hardly take revenge.

731
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,830
Unless I take revenge,

732
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,470
I won't die in peace!

733
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,470
You're a general.

734
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,750
I want you to work for me.

735
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,430
But you have to avenge your mother.

736
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,830
I know I can't stop you.

737
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,950
But after you take revenge,

738
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,470
I want you to return to me.

739
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,870
I'll give you a good position.

740
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,830
You won't let down

741
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,380
your mother.

742
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,180
Thank you, My Lord.

743
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,750
It will be a hard trip.

744
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,700
Let me give you a little present.

745
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,910
This dagger

746
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,750
cuts everything.

747
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,910
It must be sharper

748
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,390
than your sword.

749
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,990
Thank you, My Lord.

750
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,830
You may rise.

751
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,190
I'll wait for you.

752
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,990
(Huo Qingyun,)

753
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,910
(you have to know how it feels)

754
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,870
(when your beloved woman
breaks your heart.)

755
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:27,765
