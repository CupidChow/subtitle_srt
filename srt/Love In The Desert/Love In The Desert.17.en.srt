=Episode 17=

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,140
So, is she the Ninth Princess of Masui?

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,590
No.

26
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,700
She's Lady Beishuang.

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,950
She isn't our princess.

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,300
Our princess is easygoing

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,670
and generous.

30
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,150
She's in no way like Lady Beishuang

31
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,420
who is so proud

32
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,580
and indifferent.

33
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,830
You're lying!

34
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,620
You're complicit!

35
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,110
All of you!

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,950
Enough!

37
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,510
You tell me.

38
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,620
Who are you?

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,350
Huang Beishuang,

40
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,510
the princess of Enaqi.

41
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,790
Lady Beishuang

42
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,390
of Yunpei.

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,020
Confess.

44
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,830
Who's behind you?

45
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,740
What I said is true.

46
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,020
No one is behind me.

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,890
No one?

48
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,350
Then how did you get in here?

49
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,350
Confess.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,140
It's...

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,740
It's...

52
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,070
It's Zhen...

53
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,900
- Somebody.
- Yes.

54
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,830
Take away this lying woman.

55
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,020
Execute her.

56
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

57
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,420
Mercy, My Lord!

58
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,950
What I said is true.

59
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,270
Lady Youjia, save me!

60
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,350
Lady Youjia, help!

61
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,420
My Lord, I...

62
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,740
- If it gets out...
- Lady Youjia, help!

63
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,550
Everybody here

64
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,790
won't get away.

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,300
Lady Beishuang.

66
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,780
What?

67
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,590
The banquet is just over.

68
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,110
Rushing back to your chamber?

69
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,860
After what happened,

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,260
I felt tired and unfit.

71
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,230
I don't want to upset you, My Lord.

72
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,550
Can't you even bear a mere joke

73
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,790
of Lady Youjia?

74
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,790
This case is nothing to me.

75
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,790
I don't care who you really are.

76
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,670
All I want is you,

77
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,940
Huang Beishuang.

78
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,670
Thank you, My Lord.

79
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,260
I didn't uncover Lady Beishuang.

80
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,110
Stop threatening me with my mother.

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,340
Keep this.

82
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,940
Your mother worries about you.

83
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,590
Ruo Wen will occupy your city.

84
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,350
Na Zhan will not aid Masui.

85
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,230
How can I trust someone

86
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,060
who threatened me?

87
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,790
Believe it or not,

88
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,620
I just try to tell you

89
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,740
a new ruler may not be a bad thing.

90
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,380
Being reborn,

91
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,790
Masui will only improve.

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,670
It's easy for you to say.

93
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,590
But our people have to pay the price.

94
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,060
Maybe not as bad as you think it is.

95
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,500
Don't do anything silly.

96
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,590
I'll have my men get your mother here.

97
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,990
My Lord,

98
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,910
I have some confusion.

99
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,660
Lady Youjia,

100
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,590
keep your voice down.

101
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,180
You must not yell
in His Lordship's study.

102
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Get her in.

103
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,660
Yes.

104
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,110
My Lord,

105
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,910
why do you always
take Huang Beishuang's side?

106
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,300
You love me most, don't you?

107
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,500
What I said is true.

108
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,110
You think Huang Beishuang lied to me?

109
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,260
Yes.

110
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,910
What about you?

111
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,140
Me?

112
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,350
Do I have to remind you?

113
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,350
Ruo Wen.

114
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,260
How dare you?

115
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,310
And you...

116
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,860
I should reexamine you, too.

117
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,300
My Lord, let me explain.

118
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,470
I really didn't know that.

119
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,430
He...

120
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,110
He deceived me.

121
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,380
- Zhu Jun.
- Here.

122
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,420
- My Lord.
- Send her back to Yufu Pavilion.

123
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,710
Without permission,

124
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,500
she must not come out.

125
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,350
- Don't.
- Yes.

126
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,500
Don't, My Lord.

127
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,620
Don't ground me.

128
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,670
My Lady, let's go.

129
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,500
My Lord, I beg you.

130
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,230
- Lady Youjia.
- No. Don't do this.

131
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,590
Somebody! Take her away!

132
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,910
My Lord!

133
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,750
Hurry!

134
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,710
My Lord.

135
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,070
- Go.
- Go.

136
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,110
Don't discard me, My Lord!

137
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,420
My Lord!

138
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,420
My Lord!

139
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,710
Ruo Wen.

140
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,390
My Lord,

141
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,030
when I followed Zhan Bie,

142
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,550
I found someone suspicious here.

143
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,500
Trying not to alert him,

144
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,500
I followed him to a rockery
outside Yunfang Pavilion.

145
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,550
Then, he disappeared without a trace.

146
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
Yunfang Pavilion?

147
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,710
Can he travel through the ground?

148
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,790
I guess

149
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,400
there are secret passageways.

150
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,070
Did you see that man clearly?

151
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,110
He's about my weight.

152
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,430
Fair-skinned.

153
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,660
He has a mole on his jaw.

154
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,500
Hurry. Get me

155
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,350
the portrait from our spy in Tiandu!

156
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,190
Yes.

157
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,910
My Lord,

158
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,500
it's him.

159
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,740
Huo Qingyun, Lord of the North.

160
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,860
My Lord, it is my duty

161
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,310
to perform for you.

162
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,990
I don't deserve a reward.

163
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,860
I'm just very thirsty.

164
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,710
May I ask for a cup of tea

165
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,190
Her Ladyship just made?

166
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,110
Look at the guards under your command!

167
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,620
They don't function at all!

168
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,590
The rebels came and ran away

169
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,900
whenever they wanted, huh?

170
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,900
Calm down, My Lord.

171
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,590
I did my job so poorly

172
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,020
that the bandits broke in.

173
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,590
One is the princess of Masui

174
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,140
and the other is the Lord of the North.

175
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,990
Interesting.

176
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,900
There's fun to see.

177
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,180
(South Gate)

178
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,830
Get up.

179
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,380
(Heyan Mansion)

180
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,830
- Chief, look.
- Whoever resists

181
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,470
will be executed!

182
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

183
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,070
Yes.

184
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,700
You guys...

185
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,920
Come on, guys.

186
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,780
Here.

187
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,950
- Search carefully.
- Yes.

188
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,190
Let go of no one.

189
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,030
Yes.

190
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,830
Go check over there.

191
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,910
Let's go.

192
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,100
Wait for me.

193
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,950
I'll go with you.

194
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,430
When we fight fiercely,

195
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,660
I can't protect you.

196
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,790
So what?

197
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,030
I'm not scared.

198
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,780
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

199
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,230
Watch out for poison.

200
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,620
Bad guy.

201
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,950
There isn't poison.

202
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,860
But a dozen guys.

203
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,590
Show yourselves.

204
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,270
Where?

205
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,380
Where are they?

206
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,950
Put down your swords.

207
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,590
You can be allowed

208
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,500
to see your family.

209
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,980
Bandit!

210
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,190
You're bumptious, indeed.

211
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,500
Put down your dagger.

212
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,350
Otherwise, this is where you'll die!

213
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,380
That's some tough talk.

214
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,460
Fine.

215
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,470
I'll play with you.

216
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,590
Ruo Wen, my dagger.

217
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,580
Darn it.

218
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,430
There you go.

219
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,900
Ruo Wen!

220
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Ruo Wen...

221
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,900
Ruo Wen, darn it.

222
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,310
Ruo Wen, you're terrible.

223
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,780
Don't come to me.

224
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,310
Stop running.

225
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,500

Warlord Ruo Wen,

266
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,110
the ruin of Masui

267
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,950
is its destiny.

268
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,190
Warlord, I beg you

269
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,510
to spare my life.

270
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,580
I'll give you the seal of my city

271
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,390
to prove my loyalty.

272
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,910
Please spare my life.

273
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,580
I will...

274
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,230
I will follow you.

275
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,140
If I had an afterlife...

276
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,150
What?

277
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,670
Would you be a slave?

278
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,990
You beg for mercy
in front of your ancestors.

279
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,230
How do you have the face to live?

280
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,230
What if your descendants laugh at you?

281
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,430
Under such circumstances,

282
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,950
I don't care about that.

283
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,190
You're the Warlord, after all.

284
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,780
Spare your life?

285
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,590
Let me think about it.

286
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,540
This useless seal...

287
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,990
I don't need it.

288
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,990
Fox,

289
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,260
see if it can be made into a bedpan.

290
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,270
Chief,

291
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,780
it can serve not only as a bedpan

292
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,790
but also a stepping-stone in the latrine.

293
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,100
Who'd want this kind of stuff?

294
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,430
You'd better

295
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,500
take it into your coffin.

296
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,870
Mr. Ruo Wen, if you don't mind,

297
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,740
I'll take orders from you

298
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,540
and follow your lead.

299
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,380
Don't move.

300
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,100
Let me go.

301
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Or I'll kill this woman.

302
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,100
You get the wrong hostage.

303
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,430
She isn't as important
as you think she is.

304
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,190
This can't be right.

305
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,950
Isn't she your niece?

306
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,070
Niece?

307
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,550
I don't even know her.

308
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,150
Don't take me as a fool.

309
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,340
I won't capture anyone

310
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,950
who means nothing to you.

311
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,990
Nonsense!

312
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,540
You usurped power

313
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,670
and hunted my mother and me.

314
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,740
I won't let you go!

315
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,750
Don't struggle.

316
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,580
My dagger has no eyes.

317
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,100
I can always recognize

318
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,390
Ge Xinwei and her mother.

319
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,260
Liar.

320
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,100
Who'd believe a cheater like you?

321
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,750
Be patient.

322
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,100
A dying man speaks kindly.

323
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,020
I want to hear this story.

324
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,220
There's no point in it.

325
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,500
Let me kill this guy.

326
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,140
Keep him alive.

327
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,430
He may be useful someday.

328
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,340
Ruo Wen.

329
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,820
Masui was broken into.

330
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,390
Everything has gone according to your plan.

331
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,020
But why are you...?

332
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,670
Her parents are avenged

333
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,710
and she must be happy.

334
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,100
But to her, it's only the beginning.

335
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,830
Are you worried

336
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,150
her next target will be Tiandu?

337
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,910
But she's a powerless woman, after all.

338
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,230
She's powerless?

339
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,670
Is that what you think?

340
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,390
She can't stay in Yunpei.

341
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,630
Mr. Rong Huo was
secretly taken out of town.

342
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,190
He'll get to Tiandu before us.

343
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,980
(To Huang Beishuang)

344
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,660
(Masui was broken into.)

345
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,660
My Lord.

346
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,420
My Lord,

347
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,540
Desert Rankers broke into Masui.

348
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,870
Really fast.

349
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,230
What do we do?

350
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,260
Bandits have occupied a city.

351
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,260
The north desert will get chaotic.

352
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Chaotic?

353
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,670
What's so bad about it?

354
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,660
My Lord.

355
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,900
My Lord.

356
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,060
I didn't know there were
so many secret passageways

357
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,260
under the ground.

358
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,500
Na Qida,

359
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,340
you were indeed wary of me.

360
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,020
It's been 15 years.

361
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,580
I've never known

362
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,030
about this secret passageway.

363
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,500
My Lord, come this way.

364
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,510
My Lord,

365
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,500
what happened that year...

366
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,390
Back then,

367
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,950
how much more was kept from me?

368
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,750
(Father,)

369
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,500
(with your blessing,)

370
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,990
(Masui was occupied.)

371
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
(You can rest in peace.)

372
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,100
(In this chaotic world,)

373
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,100
(someone helps, protects,
values, and loves me.)

374
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,990
(He saved my life several times.)

375
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,910
(I love him)

376
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,630
(and don't want to leave him.)

377
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,830
We should go.

378
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,300
Can I settle on you?

379
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,630
Do you remember what I told you

380
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,230
when you were badly sick?

381
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,020
On the oasis,

382
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,390
you'll take Enaqi people and me

383
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,500
to sow the first seed.

384
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,430
Brick by brick,

385
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,300
we'll build our own house

386
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,030
and embrace the first wisp of smoke.

387
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,990
We'll hear

388
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,470
the baby's first cry.

389
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,100
Such a fantastic dream.

390
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,230
It's the life we wish for,

391
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,230
isn't it?

392
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,380
It is.

393
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,140
Go with me.

394
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,150
I'll give you the life you want.

395
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,740
I'll give you an oasis now.

396
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,460
As long as you approve,

397
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,350
I'll have my men travel across the desert

398
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,020
and bring all Enaqi people here.

399
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,580
From this day on,

400
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,990
no one will dare to target Enaqi

401
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,150
or this oasis.

402
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,260
(Oh, I see.)

403
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,310
I will protect you

404
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,580
and Enaqi.

405
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,820
I give you my word.

406
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,060
As long as you approve,

407
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,740
you don't need to take risks anymore.

408
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,630
Whatever you want,

409
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,630
I'll get it for you.

410
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,750
Qingyun,

411
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,550
have you made up your mind?

412
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,780
If you're with me,

413
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,020
you'll be against Yunpei

414
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,710
and Tiandu.

415
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,030
Tiandu?

416
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,390
My mother died
at the city gate of Tiandu.

417
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,300
It's a blood feud.

418
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,950
I can't forget it

419
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,430
or let it go.

420
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,500
(My top priority is to take you away.)

421
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,670
(Back in Tiandu,)

422
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,150
(I'll explain everything.)

423
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,030
I don't fear Yunpei

424
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,190
or Tiandu.

425
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,630
When you're with me,

426
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,670
I won't be scared

427
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,180
of anything in the world.

428
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
When I'm with you,

429
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,380
I won't be scared, either.

430
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
I'll go with you.

431
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,150
You will?

432
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,060
Then let's leave now.

433
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,510
Tomorrow, we'll meet

434
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,390
at Juyun Pavilion.

435
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,310
All right.

436
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,660
Tomorrow,

437
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,380
let's meet there.

438
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,870
From our journey for marriage

439
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,470
to our life in this mansion,

440
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,740
without the two of you,

441
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,820
I couldn't have got away from danger.

442
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,740
Take the money

443
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,580
and find somewhere peaceful

444
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,910
to live a good life.

445
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,500
Na Zhan may blame Enaqi.

446
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,100
But Boa Agents will protect them.

447
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,340
You should protect yourselves.

448
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,510
Your Grace.

449
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,910
Wherever you go, we'll follow you.

450
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,820
Qingyun and I

451
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,630
will move around

452
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,590
without settling down.

453
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,340
Instead of living this kind of life,

454
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,190
why don't you live alone?

455
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,940
Your Grace.

456
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,990
Yepei and I won't go

457
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,670
until you leave.

458
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,230
In this way,

459
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,500
if His Lordship suddenly returns,

460
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,060
we can buy you some time
to get out of town.

461
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,870
Protect yourselves.

462
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,500
Your Grace.

463
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,300
All right. Stop crying.

464
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,260
Your Grace, I don't want to leave you.

465
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:43,060

Qingyun!

478
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,150
Time crawls when I wait for you.

479
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,060
The Lord of the North,

480
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,870
when will you stop lying to me?

481
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,710
Don't be scared.

482
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,340
I know what you want.

483
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,820
And I know where you're going.

484
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,870
I won't stop you.

485
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,260
But before you go,

486
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,150
I have to tell you something.

487
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,630
One year ago,

488
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,670
Ge'er Jinqin wrote a letter to me.

489
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,470
If the Lady of Masui
and her daughter came

490
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,060
and I killed them,

491
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,950
he'd surrender to me forever.

492
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,300
I don't know

493
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,950
if Tiandu also received this letter.

494
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,100
Soon afterward, I heard

495
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,710
the Ninth Lady of Masui

496
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,060
was shot to death
at the city gate of Tiandu.

497
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,300
Under the command

498
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,710
of the Lord of the North.

499
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,740
I guess

500
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,190
you don't know yet.

501
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,540
The Lord of the North

502
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,190
seems to be

503
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,660
Huo

504
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Qing

505
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,030
Yun.

506
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,990
Since you know it,

507
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,300
I'm finally relieved.

508
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,670
Huo Qingyun,

509
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,710
you've been using me all the time.

510
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
Everything is just your trick.

511
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,500
I know you hate me.

512
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,300
Nothing I say will change that.

513
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,190
But today, you have to go with me.

514
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,060
If you don't want to see me anymore,

515
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,470
after you're out of here,

516
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,950
you can go anywhere you want.

517
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,050
Go with me.

518
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,030
Don't touch me!

519
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,500
After you're out of here,

520
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,780
you can cut me into pieces.

521
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,900
I'll let you take revenge.

522
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,520
In the north desert,
you pretended you would die

523
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,800
and tricked me of the Herb Volume.

524
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,390
You deliberately got close to me,

525
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,870
so I helped you save Rong Huo.

526
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,390
You colluded with Masui

527
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,660
and got my mother killed.

528
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
How can you let me take revenge?

529
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,750
Shoot!

530
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,110
Shoot!

531
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
Protect Her Grace.

532
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,540
Congratulations.

533
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,870
You avenged your mother.

534
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,140
Do you bear to watch him die?

535
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,990
He's a sworn enemy for killing my mother.

536
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,670
I stabbed him twice.

537
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,310
That is mercy.

538
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,500
You made the right choice.

539
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,750
You killed him for me.

540
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,830
You deserve

541
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,500
a reward.

542
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
What do you want?

543
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,350
Think of it and tell me.

544
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,310
I betrayed you.

545
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,910
You don't blame me?

546
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,950
I can pretend

547
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,620
nothing happened.

548
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,470
We can still be partners

549
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,750
just like always.

550
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,100
Do you still believe

551
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,390
I'll keep helping you
with no distractions?

552
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,830
I bet you will.

553
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,700
Do you still love him?

554
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
Will my love

555
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,180
influence your decision?

556
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,990
You haven't answered yet.

557
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,950
I have.

558
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,950
Let's drink.

559
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,100
What are you thinking?

560
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,310
I think what Ge'er Jinqin said is weird.

561
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,500
Cheers. Fill your cups.

562
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,690
Ge'er Jinqin...

563
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,570
Well done.

564
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,830
He's senile.

565
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,660
He plays rascal tricks

566
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,140
just to live.

567
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,830
Fancy wine.

568
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,140
You're a great man.

569
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,950
You can control everything.

570
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,220
Let's drink.

571
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,220
Come on, guys. Don't drink alone.

572
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,660
Let's propose a toast to Chief.

573
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,100
- Sure.
- Come on, Chief.

574
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,350
- Cheers!
- Drink it up!

575
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,540
The first toast to Chief.

576
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,700
He's so righteous

577
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,620
and gives us a fortune!

578
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,670
So, we no longer

579
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,870
need to wander in the desert!

580
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,100
- That's right!
- Cheers!

581
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,990
A toast to Chief, too.

582
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,910
I pledge my life to follow you, Chief.

583
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,540
I live for Desert Rankers

584
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,470
and I die for Desert Rankers!

585
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,060
Today, we've taken Masui.

586
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,750
Someday, we'll march with Chief

587
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,140
and take Yunpei!

588
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,620
Take Yunpei! Take Yunpei!

589
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,500
Guys,

590
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,830
let's drink it up!

591
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,910
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

592
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,020
We'll enjoy a great life with Chief.

593
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,180
If anyone rebels,

594
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,430
I won't let him be!

595
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,060
Yeah. We'll follow Chief.

596
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,060
Let me say something.

597
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,060
We shouldn't call him Chief anymore.

598
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,950
We should call him My Lord.

599
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,140
Not now.

600
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,080
I have this city for someone else.

601
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,940
But...

602
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,860
Chief,

603
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,500
we've just occupied the city.

604
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,990
We wait to see you be the Lord.

605
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,020
Will you...?

606
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,150
Terrible man.

607
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,270
My Lord,

608
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,790
the pond of Juyun Pavilion
has running water.

609
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,020
We did the salvage but found nothing.

610
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,830
I had my men search along the river

611
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,240
and found something unexpected.

612
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,390
Juyun Pavilion

613
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,350
is the hub of Boa Agents.

614
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,620
Boa Agents?

615
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,910
I didn't know he had another identity.

616
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,660
Get him to me, alive or dead.

617
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,470
Seal the passageways.

618
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,870
Let no one know

619
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,660
about them.

620
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
