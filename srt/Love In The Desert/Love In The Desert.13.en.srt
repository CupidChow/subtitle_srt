24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,620
Chief,

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,460
how's your injury?

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,420
What do you think?

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,260
I think you're all right now.

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,330
Thanks to Miss Beishuang.

29
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,190
So, why did you ask?

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,340
Since you've recovered,

31
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,220
why do you linger?

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,460
Who told you I recovered?

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,940
Anyway, Chief,

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,660
you have to stop it now.

35
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,540
If one day,

36
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,180
Miss Beishuang knows
what happened to her mother...

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,380
It won't happen.

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,500
Now, back to business.

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,940
Rong Huo isn't in the Library now.

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,540
Not surprising.

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,300
Keep investigating.

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,380
Be very careful.

43
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,700
I will.

44
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,100
Do something for me.

45
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,580
Go to Masui and buy

46
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,380
some rice cake from the Yue's.

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,340
Be quick.

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,420
All right.

49
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,380
Seven days at least.

50
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,740
Three days.

51
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,140
Four, then.

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,460
Chief, where are you going?

53
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,540
Home.

54
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,780
(Yunfang Pavilion)

55
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,620
Let me do it.

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,580
No need.

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,460
Lianhuan.

58
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,980
Come help me.

59
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,380
Hurry.

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,380
It took Yepei four hours
to make this hangover soup.

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,740
Hold it steady.

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,740
I will.

63
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,460
Don't spill any.

64
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,180
You're awake?

65
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,820
Come on.

66
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,020
Have some hangover soup.

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,140
Here.

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,140
Are you all right?

69
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,660
What?

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
I saw your body before. Don't be shy.

71
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,940
Let me check on your injury.

72
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,980
In case you feel bad from a hangover,

73
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,260
I tried very hard

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,060
to spend four hours
making the hangover soup.

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,710
I think my injury has flared up.

76
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,140
Where does it hurt?

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,210
The injury isn't here.

78
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,990
Your hand works better than a cure.

79
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,500
The head of Boa Agents

80
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,940
turns out to be so delicate.

81
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,780
Do you remember

82
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,260
what we said last night?

83
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,300
Yes.

84
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,420
You said,

85
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,260
you've been drinking the Spirit.

86
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,340
And...

87
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,460
You're looking for an old man.

88
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,860
What else?

89
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,860
And...

90
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,620
When you're around, I feel safe.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,180
When you're away,

92
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,980
I always have a feeling of loss

93
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,660
as if I were an empty pot.

94
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,140
The wind blows away.

95
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,820
The water flows away.

96
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,780
Nothing can stay.

97
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,580
I can't remember.

98
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,940
You can't?

99
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,620
Shall I help you recall it?

100
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,060
I just remember you said

101
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,700
we had our own missions

102
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,500
and we should go our own ways.

103
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,740
I just said drunk words. Nonsense.

104
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,980
So did I.

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,740
I said drunk words, too.

106
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,900
Don't be serious.

107
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,980
My Lady,

108
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,940
you haven't eaten anything
since this morning.

109
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,100
Have something to eat.

110
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,220
No.

111
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,260
I'm too angry to eat anything.

112
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,340
I always have to serve people.

113
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,940
How annoying!

114
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,780
My Lady,

115
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,940
why do you think

116
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,100
Ruo Wen came here?

117
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,980
For Huang Beishuang, of course.

118
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,540
She ran away from Ruo Wen.

119
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,870
He must be here to catch her.

120
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,140
A rebel broke into the Library.

121
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,500
Can it be Ruo Wen?

122
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,380
Shall we go tell His Lordship?

123
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,140
Now, Ruo Wen

124
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,700
stays at our place.

125
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,060
Without a good excuse,

126
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,940
how can we explain it to His Lordship?

127
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,740
What do we do, then?

128
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,420
Don't worry.

129
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,220
I have a plan.

130
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,860
I don't think Huang Beishuang
is a simple woman.

131
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,020
She must be involved in the Library case.

132
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,660
Then...

133
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,460
Let's add some fuel

134
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,500
to her problem.

135
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,620
My Lady, what will you do?

136
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,180
Send some wise and reliable men

137
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,540
to Enaqi

138
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,980
to investigate

139
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,260
Huang Beishuang.

140
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,380
All right.

141
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,420
Look.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,840
So many dishes.

143
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,030
There's chicken.

144
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,580
This dish is good.

145
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,580
This one is delicious.

146
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,820
That's great.

147
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,620
Taste this.

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,940
Tastes great.

149
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,380
Everybody cooks very well.

150
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,100
Fox, Wolf,

151
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,940
come and taste it.

152
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,900
Go away.

153
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,340
Tastes great.

154
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,380
So does this one.

155
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,330
Impressive.

156
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,270
We're open for business, huh?

157
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,860
All the dishes taste great.

158
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,020
I wonder if Chief can enjoy

159
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,220
such great dishes in Na Zhan's mansion.

160
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,340
Ruo Wen!

161
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,710
Keep your mouth shut. Come over.

162
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,420
How dare you lie to me?

163
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,900
Killing a bandit contributes.

164
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,700
If I kill this man for His Lordship,

165
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,180
I will be rewarded.

166
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,900
My Lady.

167
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,320
- Come on.
- My Lady.

168
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,540
Sir, a dagger for you.

169
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,460
It looks good.

170
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,940
Mr. Ruo Wen,

171
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,980
this is the best fruit
from the north desert.

172
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,540
I had meant to give...

173
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,580
Give it to you.

174
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,540
But...

175
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,020
My Lady!

176
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,420
Hope you really meant to peel the fruit.

177
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,220
Or what you lose next time

178
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,540
will be more than your hair.

179
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,620
Here you are, sir.

180
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,420
Na Zhan enjoys a great life.

181
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
How does it taste, sir?

182
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,300
Great.

183
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,660
You peeled it, after all.

184
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,500
Don't worry.

185
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,860
Someone like me

186
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,100
always returns a favor.

187
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,380
Take good care of me.

188
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,910
I'll help you win the competition.

189
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,500
Thank you, sir.

190
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,140
Come over here.

191
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,340
The dishes will get cold.

192
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,500
Taste my dishes.

193
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,620
Be right there.

194
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,860
It's something from the previous owner.

195
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,220
I tried to put it together but failed.

196
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,540
Is it that hard?

197
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,580
Such a big meal.

198
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,260
You can cook?

199
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,140
What makes you stupid?

200
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
The cooking competition is coming.

201
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,740
You read the recipe?

202
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,700
I followed it.

203
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,220
Let me taste it.

204
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm relieved, then.

205
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,220
Tastes great?

206
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,260
No.

207
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,300
I just...

208
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,080
The closer I get to you,

209
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,020
the less I think you're omnipotent.

210
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,860
I'm relieved, then.

211
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,620
What do you mean?

212
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,900
It's hard to get a perfect girl.

213
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,540
I need an entry point, huh?

214
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,700
It doesn't taste good.

215
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,740
I won't force you to eat.

216
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,780
It's all right.

217
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,230
Between a couple,

218
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,100
only one needs to cook.

219
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,180
Who's your couple?

220
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,660
I mean...

221
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,980
My wife will be lucky.

222
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,540
I'll give her early congratulations, then.

223
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,260
She'll get fancy meals.

224
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,980
Shall I cook for you later?

225
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,060
In case you think I'm deceiving you.

226
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,020
All right.

227
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,180
I'll taste it for her.

228
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,740
All right.

229
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,020
Let's eat.

230
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,860
My Lord, take care of yourself.

231
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,580
Do not overexert yourself.

232
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,860
Before the intruder is killed,

233
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,260
our city won't be in peace.

234
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,460
How's everything in Masui and Tiandu?

235
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,860
Nothing unusual.

236
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,260
Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers

237
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,300
hasn't turned up lately.

238
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Is the news reliable?

239
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,740
Yes.

240
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,480
What about Yunfang Pavilion?

241
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,060
No strangers have come in or out.

242
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,340
But the intruder was shot
by a poisoned arrow.

243
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,140
If I guess correctly,

244
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,940
he's going to die tonight.

245
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Tonight?

246
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,380
Yepei, Lianhuan.

247
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,020
Your Grace,

248
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,900
what's up?

249
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,060
Is he not back yet?

250
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,140
Your Grace, do you mean

251
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,060
Mr. Huo?

252
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,180
There are more guards tonight.

253
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,660
Is Mr. Huo in danger?

254
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,980
More guards?

255
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,180
Yes.

256
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,220
More archers as well.

257
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,220
Mr. Huo won't come, I think.

258
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,980
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

259
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,300
What happened here

260
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,460
made a big fuss.

261
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,500
If we take a risk to move rashly again,

262
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,860
I'm afraid we'll get into trouble.

263
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,820
And His Lordship...

264
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,500
I'll explain it to His Lordship.

265
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,140
Let me go with you.

266
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,020
Your Grace,

267
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,420
Mr. Huo helped us out.

268
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,820
But we saved him, too.

269
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,420
Don't give over to emotion.

270
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,780
I know what I'm doing.

271
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,780
You're hasty.

272
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,900
For what?

273
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,860
My Lord, I didn't know you would come.

274
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,500
I should have welcomed you.

275
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,140
Thinking of the cooking competition,

276
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,540
I was about to check
some ingredients in the kitchen.

277
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,220
It's windy today.

278
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,180
Don't catch a cold.

279
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,300
You'd better go tomorrow.

280
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,700
Yes.

281
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,020
I appreciate your concern.

282
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,740
Yepei,

283
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,820
go make some tea.

284
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,020
No need.

285
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,220
You come with me.

286
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,020
You seem to have made many dishes.

287
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,500
Why do you bother to go to the kitchen?

288
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,900
Because these dishes don't satisfy me.

289
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,580
They aren't taken away yet.

290
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,740
Then let me taste some.

291
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,740
Tastes good, I think.

292
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
You ask too much of yourself.

293
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,620
My Lord, I want to give you the best.

294
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,020
I need improvement.

295
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,340
Why do you not sit?

296
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,380
I'm full.

297
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,980
I'll stand and wait on you.

298
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,220
You don't have your period today.

299
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,140
You should do your duty.

300
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,220
I have a headache and I don't feel well.

301
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,460
My hand is cut, too.

302
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,260
I fear I'll fail my job

303
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,100
and spoil your fun, My Lord.

304
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,040
How long do you want me to wait?

305
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,900
For seven days.

306
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,220
Do you think I don't know
what happened that night?

307
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm giving you a chance.

308
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,540
Will you take it?

309
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,620
Make me happy

310
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,500
and I'll let go of everything.

311
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,180
My Lord,

312
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,140
I don't know what happened that night.

313
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,340
Please be perceptive.

314
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,100
If you still suspect me,

315
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,300
I'll have to die to prove my innocence.

316
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,140
Don't take it seriously.

317
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,500
I was just kidding.

318
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,220
How would I suspect my woman?

319
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,980
Get up.

320
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,540
After tonight,

321
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,340
I'll give you the oasis

322
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,860
and the Climate Volume.

323
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,860
Sorry to spoil your fun, My Lord.

324
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,060
Please punish me.

325
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,340
Blood is inauspicious.

326
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,460
That's a great sin.

327
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,020
You may rise.

328
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,220
Don't be scared.

329
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,900
I wouldn't dare.

330
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,980
Among all my women,

331
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,060
only you never see yourself
as a concubine.

332
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,220
Is it an insult to you?

333
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,060
My Lord,

334
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,740
you have so many concubines.

335
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,430
They each have unique skills.

336
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,660
Some ride and hunt with you.

337
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,300
Some enjoy romantic moments with you.

338
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,860
And I...

339
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,500
I talk with you about the Desert Scroll.

340
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,940
In the eyes of all beholders,

341
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,980
we're just different flowers

342
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,820
that fringe the lonely mansion.

343
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,420
You're generous, My Lord.

344
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,020
Please allow me to be proud.

345
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,220
Other women are flowers

346
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,980
to amuse me.

347
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,180
But you're not.

348
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,660
Do you know why?

349
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,260
First, you believe you're not a flower.

350
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,570
And I believe you'll surprise me.

351
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,780
That's why I tolerate you
as much as I can.

352
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,010
Of course,

353
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,620
I don't care if I get you.

354
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,980
You don't need to rack your brains

355
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,380
to avoid sleeping with me.

356
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,260
Rest assured, My Lord.

357
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,220
I'll finish the Desert Scroll

358
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,180
and give you a satisfactory reply.

359
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,340
Huang Beishuang,

360
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,550
you've come to Yunpei

361
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,830
and stayed by my side.

362
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,540
What on earth do you want?

363
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,980
I want your protection

364
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,660
to settle Enaqi in peace

365
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,700
and I no longer want to be a slave.

366
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,460
All right.

367
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,460
Uncover the secret in the Desert Scroll.

368
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,540
I promise you
Enaqi will always be peaceful.

369
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,820
I really appreciate it.

370
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,580
I won't let you down, My Lord.

371
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,980
Remember.

372
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,910
From this day on,

373
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,980
you're no longer my concubine.

374
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,260
You're actually

375
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,180
my partner

376
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,540
who will always live here.

377
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,610
Don't get in.

378
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,460
Leave me alone.

379
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,060
(Juyun House)

380
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,460
Sha Qu,

381
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,460
you're just in time.

382
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,660
Send back the Climate Volume to the Library

383
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,900
in case Na Zhan notices it.

384
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,100
You're done copying?

385
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,100
So, you didn't sleep last night.

386
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,380
I was sleepless.

387
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,980
So, I copied it overnight.

388
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,780
I know you care for Miss Beishuang.

389
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,260
One day, anyway,

390
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,580
we'll take revenge on Na Zhan

391
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,720
for whatever we've suffered.

392
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,020
Chief,

393
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,980
do you remember the day we met?

394
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,940
You promised you would lead us

395
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,980
to take revenge on Na Zhan.

396
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,340
We're full up.

397
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,580
Please find somewhere else to stay.

398
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,980
You're a Mr. Qu.

399
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,500
Your father is Qu Zhen.

400
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,700
To hide away from killers,

401
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,620
you have a new name Sha Qu.

402
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,300
Who are you?

403
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,740
In the 330th year of Yunpei,

404
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,180
Qu Zhen, the close aide of Lord Na Qida,

405
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,420
thought the new lord Na Zhan

406
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,940
usurped power.

407
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,020
He and a hundred officials

408
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,340
submitted a letter in blood in the court

409
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,900
and argued strongly.

410
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,820
That very night,

411
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,000
his family were all killed.

412
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,540
Later, all those righteous officials

413
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,860
were murdered one after another.

414
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,620
Who on earth are you?

415
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,620
How do you know what happened

416
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,340
and my father's name?

417
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
I'm the one who can help you get revenge.

418
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,660
Why do I cut so terribly?

419
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,420
Mr. Ruo Wen,

420
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,780
I really can't cook.

421
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,380
What do I do?

422
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,420
Stop cooking.

423
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,140
I have an idea.

424
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,060
What is it?

425
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,540
I've been enjoying too much these days.

426
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,260
Not until I cheer up.

427
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,260
We're in no hurry.

428
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,420
You get some rest.

429
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,900
Knowing about our rival

430
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,060
will make us win.

431
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,580
Who will go, you or me?

432
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,020
Me.

433
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,460
Xiaolian, go get some pastry.

434
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,540
All right.

435
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,540
Keep quiet.

436
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,380
I'll get some sleep.

437
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,140
I know you want it badly.

438
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,100
See? I bought it and rushed back.

439
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,820
Well done.

440
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,020
Chief,

441
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,660
our scouts killed some bandits
who robbed people

442
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,300
in the outlying district.

443
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,970
Later, we got to know

444
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,140
they worked for the Lord of Yunpei,

445
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,060
disguised as bandits.

446
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,980
From them,

447
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,220
we found this letter.

448
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,140

The Yue's rice cake?

451
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,660
It's all right.

452
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,820
I'm here for you.

453
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,100
Thank you.

454
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,180
I have a present for you.

455
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,180
Maybe it can solve your problem.

456
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,140
What is it?

457
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,580
I won't tell you now.

458
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,540
How about this?

459
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,660
Let's play a game.

460
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,260
If you win,

461
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,940
I'll give you the present.

462
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,540
But if I win,

463
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,100
stop exiling me.

464
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,100
Deal.

465
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,060
What do we bet?

466
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,660
The weather.

467
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,540
When I count to ten,

468
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,420
there will be thunder.

469
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,940
All right. It's a deal.

470
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,900
If you play tricks,

471
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,140
I won't spare you.

472
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,820
A bet's a bet.

473
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,820
Here I go, then.

474
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,180
One.

475
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,100
Two.

476
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,340
Three.

477
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,260
Four.

478
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,180
Five.

479

Scared?

484
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,020
I lost.

485
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,820
You didn't.

486
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,740
You didn't hear the thunder.

487
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,820
How did you know there would be thunder?

488
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,300

Do you know why I helped him escape?

557
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,020
Because he has to be killed by me.

00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,340
you studied the yield
of the Horse-unhitched Tree.

571
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,260
This is the Climate Volume.

572
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,660
(The Climate Volume of the Desert Scroll)

573
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,140
Exactly.

574
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,500
I've been reading it for days.

575
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,180
I find an existing place

576
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,580
for large-scale planting of the tree.

577
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,380
Tell me about it.

578
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,900
Masui abounds with this kind of tree.

579
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,740
Why don't you occupy the border of Masui

580
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,900
and make it available to Yunpei?

581
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,260
For some trees,

582
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,540
you want me to invade a city.

583
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,900
That's ridiculous.

584
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,060
Calm down, My Lord.

585
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,380
After I read the Dune Volume, I realize

586
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,940
the border between Yunpei and Masui

587
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,340
has mostly dunes.

588
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,500
If we take advantage
of seasonal flowing of dunes

589
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,260
and set a natural defense,

590
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,540
we don't need too many military forces.

591
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,580
With this natural shield,

592
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,420
Yunpei can be impregnable.

593
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,460
We can also grow the trees

594
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,220
as the material for armor.

595
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,060
We'll get the best of both worlds.

596
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,060
It's a good plan.

597
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,700
But it's not practicable.

598
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
Why is it not?

599
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,860
When the time is right,

600
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,980
I will let you know.

601
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,860
I heard

602
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,940
the Lord of Masui is lewd and barbaric.

603
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,820
I offer such an idea

604
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,620
simply for the benefit of Yunpei.

605
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,540
If the Lord of Masui

606
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,220
has an evil ambition someday,

607
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,060
he may break the peace on the border

608
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,420
between Yunpei and Masui.

609
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,060
Why are you suddenly
interested in politics?

610
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,140
Don't blame me, My Lord.

611
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,380
As a woman of yours,

612
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,340
I should be considerate of your city.

613
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,980
Ge'er Jinqin is a coward.

614
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,540
Under no circumstances

615
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,380
would he dare.

616
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,580
If he dares,

617
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,780
I can declare war

618
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,260
and make him surrender.

619
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,860
My Lord, your prestige

620
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,100
is famous all over the desert

621
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
and you aim high.

622
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,860
You're the hero of the world.

623
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,460
Today, I give you the Climate Volume.

624
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,620
Don't let me down.

625
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,460
Rest assured, My Lord.

626
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,540
(For my revenge plan,)

627
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,980
(Na Zhan is useless.)

628
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,660
(I have to find another way.)

629
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,820
If the two of you want to die,

630
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,180
go fight in front of Na Zhan.

631
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,140
Don't get me involved.

632
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,020
Do you hear?

633
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,660
Go get killed in front of Na Zhan.

634
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,620
Ruo Wen,

635
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,460
if you give me a hard time,

636
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,140
you'll have a harder one.

637
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,060
You don't have to remind me.

638
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,140
In this case,

639
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,260
let's suffer together.

640
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,540
He started it.

641
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,620
(Yufu Pavilion)

642
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,940
Mr. Ruo Wen,

643
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,380
how's Huang Beishuang preparing?

644
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,700
Everything is ready.

645
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,980
What are the odds of success?

646
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,500
Ninety percent.

647
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Ninety?

648
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,820
So, unless we are 100% sure to win,

649
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,260
we will lose, huh?

650
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
Didn't you promise

651
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,580
you'd help me win?

652
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,500
We didn't talk about that.

653
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,460
You didn't?

654
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,460
What did you do?

655
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,380
Some catching up.

656
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Mr. Ruo Wen,

657
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,340
you have to help me win the competition.

658
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,300
Or I'd lose everything.

659
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,580
I beg you.

660
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,580
Please, Mr. Ruo Wen.

661
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,540
Help us, please.

662
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,100
Is the food not enough?

663
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,900
I'll have Xiaolian cook more.

664
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,020
No need.

665
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,700
Then is your chamber
not comfortable enough?

666
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,500
What do you want, then?

667
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,780
Stop nagging.

668
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,620
I...

669
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,900
I've never failed anything.

670
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,900
Mr. Ruo Wen,

671
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,060
I know you're super artful.

672
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,460
You will make it.

673
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,580
What do you want?

674
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,570
Feel free to tell me.

675
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,500
I'll give it to you.

676
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,900
Here.

677
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Why don't you go to her chamber and check?

678
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,100
Me?
