Will we not leave anything to her?

We will.

26
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,390
You'll stay

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,390
and serve her.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,950
My Lady.

29
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,670
- Stop him!
- All right.

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,510
Go.

31
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,750
Don't go, Mr. Ruo Wen!

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,420
When you see Na Zhan,

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,230
don't tell him you know Ruo Wen.

34
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,990
Or you'll be killed.

35
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,180
Keep this one.

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,420
No way.

37
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,180
We have to tell His Lordship.

38
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,580
Isn't it inappropriate?

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,950
His Lordship will blame you.

40
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,460
His Lordship comes here every few days.

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,790
My chamber is empty now.

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,070
How shall I explain that?

43
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,790
If we don't confess we were robbed,

44
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,580
What will His Lordship think?

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,140
My Lord, please do me justice.

46
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,390
What happened?

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,630
Get up.

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,740
My Lord,

49
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,700
I was deceived.

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,900
You have to kill that bandit.

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,420
Or I'll keep kneeling.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,580
Bandit?

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,140
Deceived?

54
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,740
A few days ago,

55
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,580
Ruo...

56
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,950
When you see Na Zhan,

57
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,020
don't tell him you know Ruo Wen.

58
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,510
Or you'll be killed.

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,110
Ruo what?

60
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,020
Come up here.

61
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,140
A few days ago,

62
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,350
if I had stayed alert,

63
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,790
I wouldn't have suffered this.

64
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,830
After the Lantern Festival,

65
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,420
a bandit disguised himself
as a chef from my tribe

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,300
and sneaked in.

67
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,950
He eloquently fooled me.

68
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,140
He said...

69
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,580
He said he'd help me win the competition.

70
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,390
Unexpectedly, after it was over,

71
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,700
he robbed me of all my dowry.

72
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,110
I don't want to live.

73
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,270
Ridiculous.

74
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,300
Do you know who he is?

75
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,270
I don't.

76
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,620
Then did he

77
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,550
flirt with you?

78
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,980
No.

79
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,110
Absolutely not.

80
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,710
I swear to God on my tribe.

81
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,790
I'm asking again.

82
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,020
Did he

83
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
or did he not?

84
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,110
He did not.

85
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,150
My Lord, if you don't believe me,

86
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,500
I'll die to prove my chastity!

87
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,700
My Lady.

88
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,790
My Lord, don't be angry.

89
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,860
Forget it.

90
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,020
My Lord,

91
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,790
will you summon General Wu to discuss

92
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,470
how to kill that bandit?

93
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,990
Too late.

94
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,070
Zhu Jun.

95
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,470
Take them away.

96
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,710
- Yes.
- But My Lord...

97
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,260
- I'll do you justice.
- Let's go.

98
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,230
Come on, My Lady.

99
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,910
(Masui guards seven oases)

100
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,460
(with abundant resources.)

101
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,990
(Rivers and undercurrents are interlaced.)

102
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
(Around the city,)

103
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,060
(the altitude gradually rises.)

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,360
(Detrimental to quick attacks.)

105
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,300
Masui is like a ring.

106
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,740
The Lord holds the tyranny inside it.

107
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,670
Slaves and poor people
in the outside city

108
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,940
want to antagonize the Lord.

109
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,460
Chief.

110
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,460
We're ready.

111
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,580
(Huayu Mansion)

112
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,790
Good rain after a long drought.

113
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,990
Why are you worried and uneasy?

114
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,230
Don't you think it's raining
for a rather long time?

115
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,180
With more rain,

116
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,820
there'll be more oases in the desert.

117
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,660
What's bad about it?

118
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,300
Let me tell you something strange.

119
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,260
A few days ago,

120
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,910
someone saw
the immortal's palace in the desert.

121
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,110
The immortal was flying in the sky.

122
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,740
People say it's a heaven-sent good omen.

123
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,380
That's not a good omen,

124
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,790
but an evil one.

125
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,110
That's a mirage.

126
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,050
According to the Climate Volume,

127
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,730
it rains in the desert due to an imbalance

128
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,990
and the weather is reversed.

129
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,470
The rain gathers
and the moisture sticks together.

130
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,860
The desert is inundated.

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
What's worse, it's muggy.

132
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,990
Miasma sticks in the desert.

133
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Then a mirage appeared.

134
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,710
So?

135
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,740
So, there may be an epidemic.

136
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,460
(Huayu Mansion)

137
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,220
(Fengtian Pavilion)

138
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,100
My Lord!

139
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,590
Bad news, My Lord!

140
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,060
What's the fuss?

141
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,500
Maids in the Laundry House

142
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,820
had a horrible disease one after another.

143
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,310
Horrible disease?

144
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,470
This disease is peculiar.

145
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,670
Fairly acute.

146
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,870
Within two days,

147
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,590
most of the maids have been sick.

148
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,230
Lock down the Laundry House.

149
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,180
Alive or dead, no one can come out.

150
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,730
Send physicians to treat them.

151
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,630
You...

152
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,150
Lock down everywhere.

153
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,420
Without permission,

154
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,110
no one can get out.

155
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,750
Yes.

156
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,750
Yes.

157
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,830
Relax.

158
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,550
Maybe it's not that terrible.

159
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,340
Your Grace!

160
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,350
The Lord ordered lockdowns everywhere.

161
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,910
A horrible disease
is in the Laundry House.

162
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,870
Horrible disease?

163
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,500
It's been raining without sunlight.

164
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,110
This is quite normal.

165
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,230
I know medicine. I'll go check.

166
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,830
Physicians are here.

167
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,110
Why do you have to go?

168
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,350
Most physicians are men.

169
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,260
So, maids are too shy to see them.

170
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,580
Besides,

171
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,350
our top priority is to identify the cause

172
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,500
and get the right medicine.

173
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,710
Once it spreads out,

174
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,170
the consequences could be dire.

175
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,140
Fine.

176
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,180
When it gets late,

177
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,390
I'll go with you.

178
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,380
(The Laundry House)

179
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,580
High fever.

180
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,950
And they vomit.

181
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,740
It itches.

182
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,270
It itches here.

183
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,190
And they have red papule scars.

184
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,860
It's typhoid.

185
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,830
Typhoid?

186
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,340
(Yunfang Pavilion)

187
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,470
You've tried your best.

188
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,860
Typhoid usually spreads fast.

189
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,310
Even if this prescription works slowly...

190
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,190
Everywhere is locked down.

191
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,020
It shouldn't have spread so fast.

192
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,380
Water.

193
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm not thirsty.

194
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,360
I mean

195
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,460
it spreads through water.

196
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,660
Water?

197
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,110
Water coming out
of the Laundry House is dirty.

198
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,660
And it rains heavily.

199
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,300
When the standing water doesn't flow away,

200
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,590
people who touch it will be sick.

201
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,350
That is to say...

202
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,260
We need to drain away the water.

203
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,220
I'll leave this

204
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,540
to Boa Agents.

205
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,900
You stay here

206
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,260
and don't move around.

207
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,100
Qingyun.

208
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,540
Typhoid is usually ferocious.

209
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,740
When you go,

210
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,500
be very careful.

211
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,150
Chief,

212
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,140
rainwater indeed accumulates

213
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,710
near Chunxi Pavilion
and Changyue Pavilion.

214
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,260
How's everything arranged?

215
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,310
Na Zhan summoned some craftsmen.

216
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
I have them replaced

217
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,710
by our own men.

218
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,070
Good.

219
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,230
We can take advantage
and get Mr. Rong Huo out.

220
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,310
These laborers

221
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,190
don't even curtsy to His Lordship.

222
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,310
It's tiring to work in the rain.

223
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,830
Don't punish them.

224
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,670
Yes.

225
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,740
I feel bad.

226
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,740
It itches.

227
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,860
It itches so much.

228
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,260
It itches, too.

229
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,270
I'm cold.

230
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,220
I feel terrible.

231
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,100
Be careful.

232
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,980
Don't scratch.

233
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,460
My Lord,

234
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,660
there's a leak in the dungeon for Rong Huo.

235
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,070
He has to be moved soon.

236
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,710
Or he will die.

237
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,270
Hurry.

238
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,540
They're moving Rong Huo as we expected.

239
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,550
Let's move.

240
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,460
Mr. Huo.

241
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,340
Where's Beishuang?

242
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,480
Why is the door sealed?

243
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,220
- Her Grace...
- Yepei.

244
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,070
She's working on the prescription.

245
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,190
She lets no one get close.

246
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,030
I'll get in and check.

247
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,670
Her Grace said,

248
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,860
you can't get in.

249
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,910
Why?

250
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,990
What happened to her?

251
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,170
- His Lordship tried...
- Yepei!

252
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,880
His Lordship tried to kill those maids.

253
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,120
Your Grace rushed to help them.

254
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,500
She stayed there for a long while

255
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,860
and made a pledge to His Lordship

256
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,700
that she'd cure typhoid within seven days.

257
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,270
You guys stay off.

258
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,190
Are you all right?

259
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,540
Don't get close to me.

260
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,990
I think I have typhoid.

261
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,040
I've been drinking the Spirit

262
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,140
and I'm invulnerable.

263
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,230
It protects you from poison.

264
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,660
But it can't resist diseases.

265
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,470
I can't risk your life.

266
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,470
But you're so weak now.

267
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,740
What can you do?

268
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,830
I'm just tired.

269
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,190
I'll be fine after some rest.

270
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,230
If you die,

271
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,780
I'll go crazy.

272
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,070
Tell me.

273
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,230
What should I do?

274
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,070
There's a prescription on the desk.

275
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,540
Make me some decoction

276
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,190
and I'll be fine.

277
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,740
All right.

278
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,660
Why is her forehead still so hot?

279
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,620
No way.

280
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,190
If it continues, she'll be burned.

281
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,310
I heard about a great physician in Yunpei.

282
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,340
I'll go get him in.

283
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,190
It's too late.

284
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,990
We're going to Juyun House now.

285
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,350
Whatever it costs,

286
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,500
you have to get him there.

287
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,460
Yes.

288
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,540
Lianhuan, Yepei,

289
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,990
I'll take her out to see a physician.

290
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,280
If she can't be cured,

291
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,690
we won't come back.

292
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
- Protect yourselves.
- We'll go with you.

293
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,860
Her Grace needs me.

294
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,470
Wherever Her Grace goes, I'll go.

295
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,580
(Juyun House)

296
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,140
Physician, please cure her.

297
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,830
I said,

298
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,230
I can't save her life.

299
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,230
I've caught the smell of death.

300
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,470
Don't be mystifying.

301
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,830
You haven't felt her pulse yet.

302
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,350
- Get up!
- Sha Qu.

303
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,620
Don't be rude.

304
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,830
Physician,

305
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,830
he's aggressive

306
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,990
because he's too anxious.

307
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,830
Please forgive him.

308
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,790
Come on, Physician.

309
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,380
It's hard to cure her.

310
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,380
Please check on her.

311
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,310
The Spirit. Nice wine.

312
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,500
After you treat her,

313
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,860
you can drink as much as you want.

314
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,500
She isn't sick

315
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,350
due to the typhoid.

316
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,660
She used too much medicine in a short time

317
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,380
and she has accumulated toxin
in all her organs.

318
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,310
Her Grace has been
testing medicine for typhoid.

319
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,660
That explains.

320
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,150
Physician,

321
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,310
what do we do?

322
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,830
Young man,

323
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,310
since you trust me,

324
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,500
I'll tell you what you can do.

325
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,430
But whether it can save her,

326
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,020
I'm not very sure.

327
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,390
Will you try?

328
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,470
Yes.

329
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,340
Yes, of course.

330
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,740
Your robe is made of ice silk from Tiandu.

331
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,100
Looks like

332
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,190
you're a nobleman from Tiandu.

333
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,870
I want your ice toad.

334
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,070
Are you insane?

335
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,150
That's the treasure of Tiandu.

336
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,910
I'm not being greedy.

337
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,060
But the herb to cure her

338
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,950
is worth the price.

339
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,020
- You...
- Sha Qu.

340
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,830
Come with me.

341
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,220
(Juyun House)

342
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,460
Rush back to Tiandu for the ice toad.

343
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,350
If someone stops you,

344
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,390
grab it forcibly.

345
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,470
All right.

346
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,830
What worries you?

347
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,270
My Lord,

348
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,260
you really see through everything.

349
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,790
Speak.

350
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,630
I'm a little bit worried.

351
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,060
It's been five days.

352
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,020
Lady Beishuang's health...

353
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,340
There are two days to go.

354
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,260
I'm not as steady as you, My Lord.

355
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,060
Shall I go check on her?

356
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,030
No need.

357
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,910
Everything pays off in the end.

358
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,860
Let's wait.

359
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,470
I see.

360
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,100
You want to see

361
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,190
if she is really

362
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,020
the Chosen One.

363
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,380
(Juyun House)

364
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,580
Did I wake you up?

365
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,580
You're awake.

366
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,900
How do you feel?

367
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,630
I want to go out for some fresh air.

368
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,620
All right.

369
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,950
After all these days,

370
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,260
I'm back here again.

371
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,140
Thank you.

372
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,230
For what?

373
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,870
For saving your life?

374
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,950
For surviving.

375
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,500
When you first met me,

376
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,310
you said

377
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,670
I was the only brightness in the desert.

378
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,340
Now, let me tell you.

379
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,300
You're my oasis.

380
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,950
Oasis?

381
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,260
You're my sweet rain

382
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,060
and my hope.

383
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,820
I didn't understand

384
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,500
what my mother told me.

385
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,870
I didn't know what Enaqi meant to me.

386
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,500
Now, I understand.

387
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,870
It's where I belong.

388
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,470
I want to go

389
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,580
to an oasis with you.

390
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,990
All right.

391
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,150
When you recover,

392
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,580
I'll take you

393
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,990
to the oasis I've found for you.

394
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,910
Together,

395
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,870
we'll take Enaqi people

396
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,950
to sow the seeds

397
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
and harvest our own crops.

398
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,540
Using bricks

399
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,910
and tiles,

400
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,260
we'll build our house.

401
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,870
In the house,

402
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,030
the first wisp of cooking smoke will rise

403
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,430
and we'll hear the baby's first cry.

404
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,710
In the house,

405
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,580
we're young

406
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,190
and then we grow old.

407
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,550
This is how

408
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,430
we've spent countless days and nights.

409
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,390
Now, I'm old.

410
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
I can't get up.

411
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,310
Look.

412
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,300
When I'm old,

413
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,830
do I look ugly?

414
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,550
No.

415
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,660
That's impossible.

416
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,660
Look.

417
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,470
I've seen our future.

418
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,820
I have no regrets.

419
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,820
Don't be sad.

420
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,870
We just talked about our future.

421
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,620
You're satisfied already?

422
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
But I'm not.

423
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,860
(To Qingyun)

424
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,470
It's the secret I found out
from the Desert Scroll.

425
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,340
Maybe

426
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,630
it's helpful to you.

427
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,190
But only half of it.

428
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,270
I won't read it.

429
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,060
You need to find out the other half.

430
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,540
You're devoted and honest to me.

431
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,300
I feel guilty.

432
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,870
I've been

433
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,780
keeping something from you.

434
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,910
Huang Beishuang,

435
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,300
you're getting better.

436
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,670
Don't say anything like that.

437
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,430
Actually,

438
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,710
I'm not the princess of Enaqi.

439
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,990
I'm the Ninth Princess of Masui.

440
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,340
I came to Yunpei

441
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,100
to take revenge.

442
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,630
My mother

443
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,500
died at the city gate of Tiandu.

444
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,150
Qingyun,

445
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,910
I ask for nothing else.

446
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,740
I just beg you

447
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,100
to take care of Enaqi for me.

448
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,430
Beishuang.

449
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,580
I...

450
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,060
Right now,

451
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm finally relieved.

452
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,780
We're even.

453
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,910
You're honest to me.

454
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,950
I've told you everything.

455
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,180
Beishuang,

456
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,190
don't sleep.

457
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,630
You told me your secret.

458
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,300
But I haven't told mine.

459
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,340
Your enemy...

460
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,580
You have to kill him yourself.

461
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,990
Huang Beishuang,

462
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,190
listen carefully.

463
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,580
If you die,

464
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,990
wherever you are,

465
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,500
I will find you.

466
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,230
You can't get rid of me.

467
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,710
I won't leave you.

Lianhuan,

480
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,990
Yepei.

481
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,540
I'll have you sent back to Enaqi.

482
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,580
Her Grace...

483
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,260
Can she really not live?

484
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,950
I'll take her to an oasis.

485
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,470
Chief,

486
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,430
the ice toad is here.

487
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,310
What's so funny?

488
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,660
Young man,

489
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,780
you have no idea.

490
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,230
I didn't ask for the ice toad

491
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,020
because I was greedy.

492
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,740
Actually, the ice toad
is the best adjuvant.

493
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,020
With the prescription I gave you,

494
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,820
it will save her life.

495
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,700
Why is she not awake yet?

496
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,620
Beishuang.

497
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,470
Beishuang.

498
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,070
Beishuang, you're awake.

499
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,030
How do you feel?

500
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,390
I can breathe smoothly.

501
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,870
I'm also not as tired as before.

502
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,630
I can't breathe.

503
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,940
Sorry.

504
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,140
My bad.

505
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,300
My bad, actually.

506
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,580
I scared you.

507
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,780
Let's leave Yunpei.

508
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,300
Everything is ready.

509
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,430
We can leave right now.

510
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,430
Qingyun,

511
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,470
I haven't done my mission.

512
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,020
Neither have you.

513
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,630
We can't leave.

514
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,260
(Fengtian Pavilion)

515
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,750
Thank you, My Lady.

516
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,660
Thank you.

517
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,780
Thank you, My Lady.

518
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,540
Thanks to you, My Lady,

519
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,740
I've almost recovered.

520
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,820
Thank you, My Lady.

521
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,030
- Thanks.
- Congratulations, My Lord.

522
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,780
I've checked everywhere.

523
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,060
All patients have recovered.

524
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,990
You don't think too much.

525
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,260
All you do is play haphazardly.

526
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,300
You aren't aggressive at all.

527
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,470
How can you win like this?

528
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,710
My Lord, you're shrewd.

529
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,230
In no case will I win.

530
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,340
Unless I lose too badly,

531
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,740
I don't struggle to win.

532
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,910
According to Zhu Jun,

533
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,740
to test the medicine,

534
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,910
you nearly died.

535
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,910
Have you recovered?

536
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,060
I appreciate your concern.

537
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,820
I'm all right now.

538
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,630
You solved my problem.

539
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,540
What reward do you want?

540
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,340
Your trust in me

541
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,540
is the biggest reward.

542
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,990
I didn't give you the oasis.

543
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,390
Do you

544
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,950
complain about that?

545
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,340
No.

546
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,150
I didn't get the oasis

547
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,820
because I didn't do a good job.

548
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,950
Or maybe it's not the right time yet.

549
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
You did a good job.

550
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,950
As for the time...

551
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,660
When do you think

552
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,150
is the right time?

553
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,100
I don't know.

554
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,820
I just try to do everything well,

555
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,560
regardless of the consequences.

556
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,190
The time thing...

557
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,300
I believe you can judge.

558
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,060
Thanks for the mercy, My Lord.

559
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,190
Luckily, I didn't lose too badly.

560
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,260
You won.

561
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,670
Oh, General Wu.

562
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Aren't you supposed

563
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,230
to be playing chess with His Lordship?

564
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,430
Why do you have time
to patrol around here?

565
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,990
General,

566
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,950
do you try to open the secret door?

567
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,310
Open it.

568
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,500
His Lordship will
interrogate this old guy.

569
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,100
(General's Token)

570
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,900
But...

571
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,030
Good.

572
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,910
You've been wiser.

573
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,430
I've learned it from you, General.

574
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,500
(General Wu shall
interrogate Rong Huo without fail.)

575
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,140
General, in you go.

576
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,580
General, come this way.

577
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,910
General, here we are.

578
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,540
Get up.

579
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,910
Go with me.

580
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,950
It's you, General Wu.

581
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,270
I won't give you a seat, then.

582
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,750
Old madman,

583
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,990
you're almost dying, you know?

584
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,350
My mere body...

585
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,950
Bury it or dump it

586
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,270
as you wish.

587
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,310
Na Zhan wants to see me.

588
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,750
Then ask him to come.

589
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,990
How ungrateful!

590
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,430
This dirty place

591
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,990
smells even worse than a latrine.

592
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,870
Why would His Lordship come?

593
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,020
Be wise and get up.

594
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,790
Don't make me do it. Got it?

595
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,290
I...

596
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,630
It's all right.

597
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,310
- Take him away.
- The two of you.

598
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,700
Take him away. Come on.

599
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,540
Yes.

600
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,100
- Get up.
- Get up.

601
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,990
- Get up.
- It stinks.

602
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,100
Get up. Hurry.

603
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,710
Chief.

604
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,700
One side is with the other.

605
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,660
It's not against the other.
