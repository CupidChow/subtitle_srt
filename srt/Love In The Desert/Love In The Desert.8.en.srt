00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,520
So beautiful.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,730
My Lady, you're gorgeous.

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,800
Your dress looks great.

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,650
It's not like the fabric we offered.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,600
Good eye, Mr. Zhu.

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,570
It was also made somewhere else.

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,600
Good morning, My Lady.

31
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,350
Some other day,

32
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,400
I'll offer you some fancy fabric.

33
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,620
- Go make him some tea.
- Yes.

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,840
No, thank you, My Lady.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,840
The Lantern Festival is coming.

37
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,420
The wicks are short everywhere.

38
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,860
At the order of His Lordship,

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,000
I've brought you some.

40
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,520
My gratitude to His Lordship.

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,090
Wish him good health.

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,330
I'll be sure to tell him.

43
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,210
Oh, thank you.

44
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,800
His Lordship loves night tea.

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,650
At the Lantern Festival,

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,020
if you offer him

47
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,090
some fancy tea,

48
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,170
isn't it...?

49
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,090
I'll take my leave, My Lady.

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,750
Idiot.

51
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,120
You can't even wipe well.

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,590
Your Grace,

53
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,330
would you like to join us?

54
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,610
You guys do it.

55
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,170
I'm tired.

56
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,930
Your Grace,

57
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,270
we've been here for a long time.

58
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,900
But we haven't experienced

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,560
a local festival.

60
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,260
Your Grace,

61
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,520
what is a festival like in Masui?

62
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,800
What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,720
Be very careful what you say.

64
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm wrong.

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,330
Your Grace, I get it.

66
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,020
Tomorrow, let's go to the fair

67
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,450
and I'll pick you a fancy dress.

68
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,010
Lady Beishuang.

69
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,280
I'm here to give you some wicks.

70
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,330
His Lordship kept the best wicks for you.

71
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,810
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

72
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,710
Mr. Zhu, wait a minute.

73
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,250
A little present for you.

74
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,690
Thank you, My Lady.

75
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,010
See you, Mr. Zhu.

76
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,110
My Lady, let me

77
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,750
tell you something secret.

78
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm all ears.

79
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,480
His Lordship loves

80
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,160
herbal tea.

81
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,710
At the festival, in front of everyone,

82
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,840
you can offer some herbal tea.

83
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,160
Isn't that great?

84
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,010
His Lordship loves herbal tea?

85
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,390
I'll keep it in mind.

86
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,380
My Lady, don't tell others I...

87
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,600
Don't worry, Mr. Zhu.

88
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,430
Lanterns for sale.

89
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,520
- Here I am.
- Be careful.

90
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,670
- Sir.
- Wait for me.

91
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,250
- It's fun.
- I get it.

92
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,500
(Teahouse)

93
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,710
Chief,

94
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,600
all our men are here.

95
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,730
Na Zhan will hold a lantern show

96
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,330
among common people.

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,810
It's a golden opportunity.

98
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,940
In his mansion, we have to

99
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,220
find Rong Huo as soon as we can.

100
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,460
At that time,

101
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,300
Na Zhan is away.

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,660
His mansion is weakly guarded.

103
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,780
We'll go get Rong Huo.

104
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,810
Yes.

105
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,660
Whatever you need, Chief.

106
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,570
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

107
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,500
Sha Qu, you and I will head

108
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,660
for Huayu Mansion now.

109
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,700
Yes.

110
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,830
The rest of you, keep searching.

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,820
At the lantern show,

112
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,260
come get us
at the northwest of the Mansion.

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,700
Yes, Chief.

114
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,900
Leave us.

115
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,460
In his mansion, we can do two things.

116
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,660
What is the other?

117
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,940
- Shuang...
- Let's go.

118
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,900
It's been a dozen years

119
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,460
since I held a lantern show
among common people.

120
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,020
Last time it was held

121
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,340
when I was a teenager.

122
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,140
That year,

123
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,020
I had a really great time.

124
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,540
Yeah.

125
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,260
So far,

126
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,660
I've been serving you for 15 years.

127
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,900
This year's lantern show
differs from previous years.

128
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,100
Always stay alert.

129
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,140
I also had Zhu Jun get the word out.

130
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,220
At the lantern show, when I clap,

131
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,260
you come up and report.

132
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,540
Yes.

133
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,220
Our performance is a big deal.

134
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,060
Maybe it is your only chance

135
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,140
to perform in front of His Lordship.

136
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,100
You are

137
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,900
the best of the best.

138
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,140
Today, show me

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,700
the best you can do.

140
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

141
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,300
Your Grace,

142
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,220
however busy you are, you need some rest.

143
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,460
If you keep sitting like this, you'll bend over.

144
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,140
Your Grace, stop reading.

145
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,500
Come on, Your Grace.

146
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,340
Learn from me. Look.

147
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,180
Stretch and relax.

148
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,620
That's right.

149
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,100
It makes us live longer.

150
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,940
Every time we go on a mission,

151
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,580
we hang a red ribbon on the branch

152
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,980
to pray for safety return.

153
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,220
(Yun)

154
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,100
(We can't be together in this life.)

155
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,180
(Wish you all the best.)

156
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,580
(Yun)

157
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,660
Your Grace,

158
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,180
His Lordship is here.

159
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,540
It's been a while.

160
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,180
I'm here to see you, Beishuang.

161
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,180
I didn't know you would come, My Lord.

162
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,940
Don't stand there. Take your seat.

163
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,340
I gave you the Dune Volume a few days ago.

164
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,700
After you read it,

165
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,700
what have you got?

166
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,340
Please have some tea, My Lord.

167
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,180
Silly me. I just understood a little.

168
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,580
I haven't figured out too much yet.

169
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,220
Please give me more time, My Lord.

170
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,900
No worries.

171
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,460
You've learned the Herb Volume by heart.

172
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,100
I believe understanding the Dune Volume

173
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,860
is just a matter of time.

174
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,580
I won't let you down, My Lord.

175
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,580
After you succeed,

176
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,460
I'll give you a big present.

177
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,740
What do you say?

178
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,820
Thank you, My Lord.

179
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,700
My Lord,

180
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,860
the performers have been selected.

181
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,700
And...

182
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,820
Never mind.

183
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,180
Go ahead.

184
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,220
Today, the envoy from Masui sent presents

185
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
of congratulations.

186
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,220
Very few presents, though.

187
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,380
Ge'er Jinqin, the Lord of Masui

188
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,580
is vile and shortsighted.

189
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,860
Our city is wealthy

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,980
and we don't care for his offerings.

191
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,660
Leave us.

192
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,180
Yes.

193
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
My Lord, this is Chiyang Tea

194
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,740
from Masui.

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,220
How does it taste?

196
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,860
At first, it tasted bitter.

197
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,220
But later, sweet.

198
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,460
It's offered by Masui every year.

199
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,340
If you like it,

200
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,460
I'll have it delivered to you.

201
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,700
Thank you, My Lord.

202
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,580
Does Masui

203
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,420
give offerings every year?

204
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,220
Every second month,
the two cities are open for trade.

205
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,540
Masui offers some presents

206
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,580
to show their sincerity.

207
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,580
Then, their people

208
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,300
can trade things

209
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,180
to make a living.

210
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,820
What?

211
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,580
Do you also know politics?

212
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,780
No.

213
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,340
I'm just curious.

214
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,060
Masui has barren lands.

215
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,860
But it can produce what Yunpei needs.

216
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,820
That's a rather small city.

217
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,820
What can they produce?

218
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,580
Masui barely survives

219
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,100
on the trades with us.

220
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,820
My Lord, you bless

221
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,660
the prosperity of Yunpei.

222
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,500
All right.

223
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,220
Enough of the pleasantry.

224
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,220
It's noon. Time to have lunch.

225
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,700
Lady Beishuang,

226
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,980
have lunch with me.

227
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,820
Thank you, My Lord.

228
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,540
But I want to go back to the Dune Volume,

229
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,860
in case I hold up your business.

230
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,100
I'll eat with you another day.

231
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,220
Good reason, indeed.

232
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,540
Whatever you say.

233
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,860
I'll wait and see.

234
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,740
See you, My Lord.

235
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,220
What do you think

236
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,220
is His Lordship's attitude towards Masui?

237
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,700
He approves business trade.

238
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
A good attitude, I think.

239
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,820
As far as I can see,

240
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,700
he talked with complete disdain.

241
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,460
He doesn't respect Masui at all.

242
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,820
Masui has a new lord now.

243
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,740
Why can't I complain?

244
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
Your Grace, what do you think?

245
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,220
Masui used to offer symbolic presents.

246
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,940
The new lord continued the old custom.

247
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
He didn't offer more presents

248
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,820
or break off with Yunpei.

249
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
It's hard to judge.

250
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,460
(I'll try to probe him another time.)

251
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,300
So, Her Grace still cares about Masui.

252
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,540
Don't be absurd.

253
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,300
Isn't that right?

254
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,500
Your Grace.

255
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,100
Mr. Rong.

256
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,100
Mr. Rong,

257
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,540
I've been too busy these days

258
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,740
to care enough about you.

259
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,820
Sorry, you were ignored.

260
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,940
Please forgive me.

261
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,340
I've brought you some food and drink.

262
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,860
Mr. Rong.

263
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,780
Mr. Rong.

264
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,700
Such a rare visitor.

265
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,820
I'm the Lord of Yunpei.

266
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,420
Not a visitor, actually.

267
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,340
What exactly are you?

268
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,740
A lord who usurped power

269
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,460
or a visitor who betrayed?

270
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,460
You know that best.

271
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,220
Looks like

272
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,340
this chamber isn't terrible enough.

273
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,460
Mr. Rong,

274
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,940
you're still glib-tongued.

275
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,220
I am dying.

276
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,100
You can just give me a tomb.

277
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,100
Why do you bother locking me here?

278
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,100
Such a waste of this fancy room.

279
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,940
You're wrong.

280
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,620
To Yunpei,

281
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,980
you're someone who made every effort.

282
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,300
To me,

283
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,820
you're someone very important.

284
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,940
A mere tomb

285
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,940
isn't good enough for you.

286
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,340
I just fear...

287
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,100
Then tell me.

288
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,340
What scares you,

289
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,340
Lord of Yunpei?

290
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,340
I just fear

291
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,860
you don't have enough

292
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,700
to eat or wear.

293
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,460
Look.

294
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,740
The dishes and wine for you.

295
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,460
If you don't eat,

296
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,180
they'll get cold.

297
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,820
It makes sense.

298
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,340
I must not waste food.

299
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,300
Then let me see

300
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,100
what I will enjoy today.

301
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,700
Mr. Rong.

302
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,100
- Nice.
- I'm here

303
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,100
to tell you something.

304
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,340
The Lantern Festival is coming.

305
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,900
By then,

306
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,740
I'll give you a little present.

307
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,380
I don't want that.

308
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,940
Keep it yourself.

309
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,740
Mr. Rong,

310
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,740
it's too early to say no.

311
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,300
By then, you'll know what it is.

312
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,700
Such fancy food.

313
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,380
But eating too much

314
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,860
will stuff me to death, too.

315
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,620
Tastes great.

316
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,620
Chief,

317
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,340
today is Yunpei's festival.

318
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,460
Many outlanders are there.

319
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,460
It's loosely guarded.

320
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,980
I'll go get our men here.

321
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,420
Let's sneak in now.

322
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,460
That'd attract too much attention.

323
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,700
Have our men sneak in,
in batches and in disguise.

324
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,260
After that,

325
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,860
find that woman as soon as possible.

326
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,700
Yes.

327
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,220
Ruo Wen!

328
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,420
Ruo Wen!

329
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,500
Why did you ride so fast?

330
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,860
I rode so hard but couldn't catch up.

331
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,580
Tell me. Why did you leave me behind?

332
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,180
Say something. Are you mute?

333
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,780
Why did you leave me behind?

334
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,020
Little princess,

335
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,980
we're Desert Rankers. Bandits.

336
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,540
We don't play house, understand?

337
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,340
I'm not playing house.

338
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,340
You know what?

339
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,300
Whoever I want

340
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,860
can never get away from me.

341
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,260
Go away.

342
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,100
This isn't the reason you can stay.

343
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,860
You want a reason?

344
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,260
Fine.

345
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,580
Let me be honest.

346
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,580
I'm in love with you.

347
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,180
Is it a good reason?

348
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,260
Don't say anything like that.

349
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,820
You don't believe me?

350
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,820
How about I prove it with my death?

351
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,580
You don't need to.

352
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,820
I no longer care for anyone.

353
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,140
Killing yourself isn't worth it.

354
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,900
Ruo Wen.

355
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,540
Let's go.

356
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,780
- Ruo Wen.
- How clingy.

357
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,860
Don't try to get me, huh?

358
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,860
How narcissistic.

359
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,300
That's just what I want.

360
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,500
Ruo Wen.

361
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,100
Let's go.

362
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,340
You go check over there.

363
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,180
Yes.

364
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,660
Tonight, Na Zhan

365
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,180
will take Rong Huo to the lantern show.

366
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,580
Change of plans.

367
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,420
Chief and I will perform at the show.

368
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,100
You make a chance

369
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,540
to get Rong Huo.

370
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,580
By then,

371
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,580
you take action at Chief's whistle.

372
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,420
- Understand?
- Yes.

373
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,100
Off you go.

374
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,740
Sha Qu,

375
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,820
get changed and go to the fair with me.

376
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,980
Let's see if we can
take advantage of the terrain.

377
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,260
All right.

378
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,180

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,060
Her name is Huang Beishuang.

542
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,540
She married Na Zhan?

543
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,820
Hear me out.

544
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,980

548
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,500
hide around the fair.

549
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,580

00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,840
None of your business.

How does it work?

562
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,460

needs some minions.

There's hope to be immortal.

564
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,580
It costs only three pennies.

565
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,300
Three pennies.

566
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,420
Who wants to try?

567
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,540
It's a trick, huh?

568
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,180
There must be a mechanism.

569
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,820
Yeah. Secret compartments.

570
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,140
There is a mechanism.

571
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,820
Do you want to know?

572
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,740
Yes.

573
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,740
Let's pay three pennies.

574
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,100
You can have a try.

575
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,060
- All right.
- Go.

576
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,900
Take this.

577
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,620
Come on.

578
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,820
Come over here.

579
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,140
Sir, I'd like to try.

580
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,980
No problem. Come on.

581
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,500
Wait here for me.

582
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,500
I will.

583
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,540
She got in. Watch carefully.

584
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,180
Three, two, one.

585
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,980
Here we go.

586
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,180
- Open it.
- Open, treasure box.

587
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,360
She's gone.

588
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,620
Anybody in there?

589
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,100
Check if anybody is in there.

590
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,980
