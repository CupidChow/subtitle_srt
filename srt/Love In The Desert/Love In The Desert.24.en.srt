24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,540
(Yingxue Pavilion)

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,190
It's been seven days.

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,430
He's been missing for seven days.

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,940
The documents pile up.

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,700
Since we can't stay in Fentian,

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,780
let's try something else.

30
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,220
We gather our men tonight

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,750
and invade the border of Yunpei.

32
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,470
We can't get a town for nothing.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,470
I can't risk your life.

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,580
Do I have to watch my men stay homeless?

35
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,980
How about this?

36
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,420
You leave with me.

37
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,950
Let go of everything

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,180
and stay from the desert.

39
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,460
We go to the Central Plains

40
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,480
and wander around, all right?

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,140
Discard my men and let go of my enemy...

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,740
I can't do that.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,950
But now, even Fentian is collapsing.

44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,140
How about this?

45
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,350
Let's go over to Tiandu.

46
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Huo Qingyun owes you.

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,070
He won't reject you.

48
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,460
When the two cities ally,

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,830
Na Zhan will lose.

50
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,700
Beishuang,

51
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,550
you're always a survivor.

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,350
I don't believe you're dead.

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,540
Ruo Wen.

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
For you,

55
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,300
for Fentian,

56
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,270
and for myself.

57
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,550
Ruo Wen of Fentian...

58
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,350
Next,

59
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,140
what is he going to do?

60
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,510
They're too starving

61
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,020
to think of anything else.

62
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,980
My Lord,

63
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,580
we should send troops immediately

64
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,550
to take down Tiandu.

65
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,700
Before we know how strong Tiandu is,

66
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,110
we can't invade it rashly.

67
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,020
My Lord,

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,460
will you always
be threatened by Huo Qingyun?

69
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,420
All you want is take back
what belongs to you.

70
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,510
Tiandu is impregnable.

71
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,900
If we start a war rashly,

72
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,950
what are the odds of winning?

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,390
Do you really think
Huang Beishuang isn't dead?

74
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
What do you mean?

75
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,420
The secret of the Desert Scroll

76
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,140
is in the hands of Huang Beishuang.

77
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,110
If she's still alive,

78
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,700
she won't ignore Enaqi people.

79
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,300
If she's dead,

80
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,180
do you think Huo Qingyun will ignore them?

81
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,710
But Enaqi has been our tribe.

82
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,740
Such rumors

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,910
are bad for us.

84
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,220
Right.

85
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,230
We can use the Enaqi Tribe

86
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,740
to write a letter to Tiandu.

87
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,740
Tell them

88
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,300
we've got something on them.

89
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,300
Let's warn them.

90
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
In this way,

91
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,740
we'll play along.

92
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,550
Whatever you want, My Lord,

93
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
the lady or the book...

94
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,500
You'll get it.

95
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,220
Yes.

96
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,940
One more thing.

97
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,790
Tell the two of them.

98
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,740
I'm not scared

99
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,990
of any rumors about my origin.

100
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,740
By then,

101
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,820
unless I get a satisfactory reply,

102
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,550
I'll fight Tiandu desperately

103
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,110
at whatever cost

104
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,710
and burn together with them.

105
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,060
(Tiandu)

106
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,580
Now,

107
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,670
will you still keep my suicide note?

108
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,430
Chief.

109
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,550
Chief,

110
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,940
a letter came from Yunpei,

111
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,030
asking us

112
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,910
to give them Miss Beishuang's body.

113
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,870
Otherwise...

114
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,990
Otherwise what?

115
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,590
Otherwise, Yunpei

116
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,710
will take back the oasis it gave Enaqi.

117
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,950
They also said

118
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
they'd send troops

119
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,420
and start a war

120
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,860
for our taking her body.

121
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,110
If we mean peace,

122
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,310
in three days,

123
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,790
we'll negotiate on the border.

124
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,630
I get it.

125
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,780
Away you go.

126
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,710
Enaqi belongs

127
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,350
to Yunpei.

128
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,260
Na Zhan isn't that kind of man

129
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,500
to let himself be gossiped about.

130
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,300
Looks like they're ready for a negotiation.

131
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,150
Enaqi is just an excuse.

132
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,940
What they really want is...

133
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,660
I know.

134
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,740
I won't let anyone

135
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,550
take you away from me.

136
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,940
But the war between the two cities

137
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,470
is the last thing I want to see.

138
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,660
Don't worry.

139
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,820
Tiandu has been closed for years
with very strong armies.

140
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,870
Even if we fight a war,

141
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,500
Na Zhan isn't 100% to win.

142
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,990
Most importantly,

143
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,230
I don't allow anyone

144
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,790
to use you as an excuse for a war.

145
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,590
We can't give him the books.

146
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,860
We can do something on the copies

147
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,020
and stall for time.

148
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,100
Don't worry.

149
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,790
I've sent troops
to the frontline for preparations.

150
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,110
This trip won't be dangerous.

151
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,780
Promise me.

152
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,420
You have to be very careful.

153
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,380
I've put my armor on.

154
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,100
Wait until I'm back.

155
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,020
(Tiandu)

156
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,390
Beishuang,

157
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,910
I don't believe you're dead.

158
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,420
Fentian is in danger of collapse.

159
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,110
Please help us.

160
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,710
Miss Beishuang, you want something

161
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,230
from me, huh?

162
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,390
Mr. Rong,

163
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,030
you know Na Zhan wants the Desert Scroll.

164
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,990
Qingyun gave him some copies.

165
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,790
But I'm still worried

166
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,910
that he may figure out the secret.

167
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,550
Then, have you figured it out?

168
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,300
Don't worry.

169
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,380
Na Zhan has the five copies

170
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,260
but he can't figure out the secret.

171
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,780
He knows how to decode the books.

172
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,950
Why are you sure he can't make it?

173
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,470
The late lord, my brother, and I
traveled around the desert

174
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,900
and compiled the Desert Scroll

175
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,350
to make life better for people

176
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,260
in the desert.

177
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,660
Unexpectedly,

178
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,230
it's gradually become
a tool for a power fight.

179
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,620
It's against the late lord's desire.

180
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,590
People spread the incorrect rumor

181
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,620
of the five books.

182
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,260
Actually, there's the sixth volume

183
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,660
of the Desert Scroll.

184
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,020
In Sanjiang,

185
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,740
we wrote six books.

186
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,260
His Lordship gave the Oasis Volume

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,900
to my brother Rong Ruo.

188
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,430
But over all these years,

189
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,860
I haven't found my brother.

190
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,780
Sanjiang?

191
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,950
There's a karst cave in Sanjiang.

192
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,260
During our trip through the desert,

193
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
we found it by accident.

194
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,070
It was cool and secluded.

195
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,620
We decided to stay there for the books.

196
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,110
There, we finished the books.

197
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,740
Later, news came

198
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,020
that my brother Rong Ruo and his wife

199
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,710
passed away

200
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,110
in Sanjiang.

201
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,110
I've always refused to believe this.

202
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,830
If my brother

203
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,740
was shot and fell into quicksand...

204
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,350
I'm thinking.

205
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,470
If he luckily fell into the cave,

206
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,590
he'd survive.

207
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,590
If Mr. Rong was alive,

208
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,230
all these years,

209
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,710
we should have heard from him.

210
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,430
I wonder.

211
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,990
If my brother

212
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,740
really fell into the cave,

213
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,990
unless he died immediately,

214
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,310
he would leave clues for Young Lord.

215
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,860
Do you mean

216
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,310
the edict?

217
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,100
All right.

218
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,540
I'll go there.

219
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,310
But

220
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,900
you can't let Young Lord go with you.

221
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,710
His identity

222
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,660
is the best leverage to hold Na Zhan up.

223
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,590
He must not take risks.

224
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,070
I'm dead in people's eyes.

225
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,740
I can't turn up.

226
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,900
I knew you survived.

227
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,470
Have you had a plan?

228
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,100
Come over

229
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,310
and put the shoes on me.

230
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,350
Forget it, then.

231
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,780
I'm going to Tiandu for the Desert Scroll

232
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,790
and check

233
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,900
if it has a solution.

234
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,710
Will Huo Qingyun give it to you?

235
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,670
I know what to do.

236
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Don't even lose yourself.

237
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,140
It's you who don't want

238
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,860
to lose me, huh?

239
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,950
Ruo Wen,

240
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,350
give me your word.

241
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,430
You will not send troops rashly.

242
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,860
Be very careful

243
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,190
until I'm back.

244
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,780
Rash woman.

245
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,110
Come back early.

246
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,470
You freaked me out.

247
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,020
When did you come back?

248
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,780
Was it going smoothly?

249
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,700
Yes.

250
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,500
But it's just a stopgap.

251
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,310
Na Zhan will find the problem.

252
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,350
Before that,

253
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,140
hope we'll make some progress.

254
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,300
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

255
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,150
Chief,

256
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,900
a letter from Tiandu.

257
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,660
Rong An,

258
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,260
we haven't met for 15 years.

259
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,470
I really miss you.

260
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,110
Hope I can meet you in Tiandu soon.

261
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,690
(Rong Huo)
I'll see you here in the middle of this month.

262
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,310
Chief,

263
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,860
I heard Princess Xinwei went to Tiandu.

264
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,620
Yes.

265
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,830
Her trip will be dangerous.

266
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,100
Why?

267
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,620
News just came

268
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,260
that the desert had been chaotic.

269
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,710
Yunpei and Tiandu

270
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,710
are preparing troops and provisions.

271
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,140
Throughout the desert,

272
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,780
agents and vanguards wander everywhere.

273
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,900
I'm worried about Her Grace.

274
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,140
Shall we send Desert Rankers

275
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,830
to catch up and secretly escort her?

276
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

277
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,230
I read in the Desert Scroll

278
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,110
that Fentian has a high terrain.

279
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,190
There's petrosal water under the ground.

280
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,660
Petrosal water is highly fluid.

281
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,740
Over the years,

282
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,470
Fentian's ground is hollow.

283
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,710
Na Zhan blew up some important points

284
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,660
and accelerated collapses.

285
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,990
What can you do?

286
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,420
You've read all volumes

287
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,780
of the Desert Scroll, haven't you?

288
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,830
To be honest,

289
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
there are six volumes.

290
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,900
If we can find the Oasis Volume,

291
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,260
there'll be a ray of hope.

292
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,380
In the worst case,

293
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,430
we can find the best oasis for migration.

294
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,540
Where's the sixth volume?

295
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,380
Let's go find it.

296
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,620
No.

297
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,470
I can't leave Tiandu.

298
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,500
If I leave,

299
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,070
Qingyun will leave, too.

300
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,350
Na Zhan is watching Tiandu closely.

301
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,380
We can't let him find a loophole.

302
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,380
No one

303
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,110
can know about this,

304
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,500
including Qingyun.

305
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,660
I'll go find it myself.

306
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,500
I won't get Tiandu involved.

307
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,860
I have an idea.

308
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,780
You have to cooperate.

309
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,310
Mr. Rong Huo.

310
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,740
He's here.

311
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,950
I'm here for Ge Xinwei,

312
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,990
not him.

313
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,460
An.

314
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
My name is Ruo Wen.

315
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,700
Boy,

316
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,710
sorry for what you've suffered.

317
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,110
Tell me.

318
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,380
That year...

319
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,740
How did you

320
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,710
get away from Na Zhan's soldiers?

321
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,980
By fate.

322
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,660
By myself.

323
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,950
I know.

324
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,950
You hate me.

325
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,470
You hate your father, too.

326
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,500
I don't remember having a father.

327
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,260
We're sorry.

328
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,470
When you were an innocent boy,

329
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,310
you suffered such a terrible thing.

330
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,470
But...

331
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,900
protecting the late lord's son

332
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,830
is the mission of our family.

333
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,110
It's your mission!

334
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,380
Don't get me involved!

335
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,150
The two of you,

336
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,350
I wouldn't have come this far

337
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,470
without your family's support.

338
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,950
I'd like to bow to you.

339
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,990
Young Lord, don't do this.

340
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,310
Please don't.

341
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,910
An,

342
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,860
you have no idea.

343
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,900
Your father and I

344
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,900
were decedents of a guilty official.

345
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,470
The late lord prevailed over all opponents

346
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,260
and kept us alive.

347
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,860
Otherwise, our family

348
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,900
would have been gone.

349
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,470
In this case,

350
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,430
only when we protected the late lord's son

351
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,230
could we repay him.

352
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm old.

353
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,190
In our family,

354
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,830
there's only you.

355
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,110
But Na Zhan

356
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,430
is cunning and cruel.

357
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,540
Unless you work with Young Lord,

358
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,950
you won't defeat him.

359
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,300
I want you

360
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,540
to let go of personal grudges

361
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,470
and work with Young Lord

362
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,470
to bring peace back to the desert.

363
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,580
Young Lord.

364
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,670
An.

365
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,100
An.

366
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,540
You look dusty.

367
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,190
You must be a poor man

368
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,670
without any treasures.

369
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,990
Naive men with a death wish.

370
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,780
That's some tough talk.

371
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,310
I don't have treasures.

372
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,470
I just have my life.

373
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,190
Come get it if you want.

374
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,780
Madwoman?

375
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,430
Where are you going?

376
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,430
Good boy, move.

377
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,780
Horse, where are you going?

378
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
Don't go back.

379
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,390
It's an obedient horse.

380
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,380
Ruo Wen.

381
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,650
What are you doing here?

382
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,510
Go on.

383
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,430
Go on pretending.

384
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,230
Didn't you see how I fought those guys?

385
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,940
Why did you run away?

386
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,710
I thought they were killing a bandit.

387
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,270
Or what?

388
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,300
Shall I join the fight?

389
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,950
What if I'm hurt?

390
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,380
Madwoman,

391
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,900
tell me.

392
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,740
In Tiandu,

393
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,630
what did you get?

394
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,150
I met Huo Qingyun.

395
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,590
Huang Beishuang is dead.

396
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,550
He's distressed.

397
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,100
I met Huo Qingyun, too.

398
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,540
Why did he not talk about you?

399
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,950
You met Huo Qingyun?

400
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,270
For what?

401
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,140
Don't ask.

402
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,100
Answer me.

403
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,230
We met at different times.

404
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,430
Maybe he met you before me.

405
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,470
And then?

406
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,990
Then...

407
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,910
Then, I went to Huang Beishuang's tomb

408
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,510
and bowed to her.

409
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,780
In this desert,

410
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,390
whoever dies

411
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,260
will just be dust.

412
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,340
Nothing to stick around for.

413
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,740
I stick around for nothing.

414
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,500
Get down to business.

415
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,700
Don't stare at me like that.

416
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,550
It makes me uncomfortable.

417
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,620
Don't touch me.

418
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,590
Now, back to business.

419
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,630
In the desert,

420
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,020
there's the sixth volume.

421
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,540
If we find it,

422
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,820
it will be ours.

423
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,830
The sixth volume?

424
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,710
I don't even have one.

425
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,510
Why do I bother about that?

426
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,470
Tell me.

427
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,670
After you left Tiandu,

428
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,740
shouldn't you go south?

429
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,950
Why did you go east?

430
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,470
I...

431
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,670
I'm going to Sanjiang

432
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,910
to find the sixth volume.

433
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,580
If I didn't go east,

434
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,820
shall I go north?

435
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,950
Sanjiang is so desolate.

436
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,190
A volume is there?

437
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,860
Because...

438
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,910
Your father had the six volume.

439
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,500
Didn't you say

440
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,020
that is where your father died?

441
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,950
Don't follow me.

442
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,820
The desert is unstable.

443
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,780
Fentian's leader can't be away.

444
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,580
I can go alone.

445
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,190
Fine. I won't follow you. Go ahead.

446
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,230
After she's returned from Tiandu,

447
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,260
she speaks very differently.

448
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,990
What trick is she playing?

449
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,340
- Brat, give me...
- Beishuang.

450
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,710
I just heard you say "brat".

451
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,190
I said...

452
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,780
Folk.

453
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,870
Folk, I mean.

454
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,990
Why is there

455
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,060
nobody at all?

456
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
Open it and see.

457
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,910
What is this?

458
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,500
I don't like rice cake.

459
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,020
I don't have a fever.

460
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,710
Don't eat it, then.

461
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,390
But never say you don't like it again.

462
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,580
Why?

463
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,580
Never mind.

464
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,580
Have you figured out

465
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,710
the secret in the Desert Scroll?

466
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,780
I'm a little bit tired.

467
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,540
Let's not talk about this.
I need some rest.

468
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,780
All right. Let's not talk.

469
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,100
Want a bath? Let's have it together.

470
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,390
Today,

471
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,910
I don't want a bath.

472
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
It's early.

473
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,940
Are you not done with political affairs?

474
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,500
Do what you have to do. Go.

475
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,540
Hurry.

476
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,980
- It matters most.
- I...

477
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,780
I'm all right. Away you go.

478
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,940
Just go.

479
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,420
Go.

480
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,990
Are you insane?

481
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,110
You drove away the horse.

482
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,390
How can I ride to Sanjiang?

483
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,150
We have this.

484
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,780
I can't touch you, huh?

485
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,780
Then you walk to Sanjiang.

486
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,670
Or just get on my horse.

487
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,710
How shameless!

488
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,500
Just to you, you know.

489
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,510
You didn't follow me, huh?

490
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,470
Why are you here?

491
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,060
After you've returned from Tiandu,

492
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,780
you speak very differently.

493
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,080
Do you collude with Tiandu

494
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,780
behind my back

495
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,500
and play some tricks?

496
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,060
What if I serve as a lobbyist

497
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,470
and make you work with Huo Qingyun?

498
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,630
It won't happen.

499
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,980
I'm hungry.

500
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,190
Let's go find some food. Go.

501
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,550
Let go of me.

502
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,100
How can we find food in the desert?

503
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,820
We must arrive in Sanjiang before dark.

504
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,180
The volume matters most.

505
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Something's wrong with this copy.

506
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,820
My Lord, what do you mean?

507
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,910
Something's missing.

508
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,190
And I can't verify

509
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,020
the missing part.

510
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,230
Report!

511
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,100
Report!

512
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,440
What happened?

513
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,300
My Lord, when we went out

514
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,990
to patrol in the south of Tiandu,

515
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,110
we ran into a bandit.

516
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,540
It turns out to be Ruo Wen.

517
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,340
He killed some of our men

518
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,740
and ran east away.

519
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,230
Why is Ruo Wen in Tiandu?

520
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,500
I kind of saw him

521
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,740
run after a woman.

522
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,470
Woman?

523
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,390
What does she look like?

524
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,510
I was too far away.

525
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,740
I didn't see clearly.

526
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,020
- Leave us.
- Yes.

527
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,910
Ruo Wen is in Tiandu.

528
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,020
He's going east

529
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,190
after a woman.

530
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,710
My Lord.

531
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,580
Speak.

532
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,820
The southeast of Tiandu is remote.

533
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,470
Only Sanjiang is there.

534
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,230
Sanjiang?

535
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,100
Is that where

536
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,260
Rong Ruo died?

537
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,420
Yes.

538
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,300
- Wu Jihai.
- Here.

539
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,230
Send a squad to catch up with them.

540
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,150
Don't do anything rash now.

541
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,920
Maybe

542
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,580
we'll find something surprising.

543
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,580
Chief,

544
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,740
Yunpei's soldiers are massing on our border

545
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,790
and haven't left.

546
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,300
Looks like we have to hurry.

547
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,430
Is Ruo Wen back in Fentian?

548
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,420
Word came

549
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,700
that he went out of Tiandu

550
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,470
and went to Sanjiang with Ge Xinwei.

551
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,420
Sanjiang?

552
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,710
To worship his parents?

553
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,780
Or to find a solution to the collapses.

554
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,580
Fentian's problem

555
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,110
can't be solved in a short time.

556
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,070
Let's do this.

557
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,500
Have Boa Agents get the word out.

558
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,820
All homeless people in Fentian

559
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,030
can come to Tiandu for shelter.

560
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,990
Besides,

561
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,300
we must keep a close eye

562
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,990
on the border of Fentian.

563
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,950
If Na Zhan swoops in,

564
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,430
we must not just stand by.

565
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,860
Yes.

566
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,790
Do you think she's become

567
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,470
a totally different person?

568
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,910
Her temper has changed

569
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,910
and always rejects me.

570
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,380
Chief,

571
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,340
Miss Beishuang has suffered too much.

572
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,180
Maybe she's in a bad mood.

573
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,470
Bad mood?

574
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,500
Will it make her behave differently?

575
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,300
Chief, don't overthink.

576
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,390
Can she be an imposter?

577
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,820
I verified it.

578
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,260
According to the Herb Volume,
the skin mask is resilient.

579
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,820
But do not wet it.

580
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
Or it'll melt.

581
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,660
Who are you?

582
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,300
What are you talking about?

583
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,340
It's you.

584
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,340
In Tiandu, be very careful.

585
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,260
Huo Qingyun is thoughtful.

586
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,870
Be careful with everything.

587
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,150
We're pressed for time. Come back early.

588
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,100
Huo Qingyun knows about the mask.

589
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,980
If he sees through you,

590
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,430
give him this letter.

591
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,900
Make it quick.

592
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,230
Ruo Wen can't wait for too long.

593
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,660
It's you.

594
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,710
What are you keeping from me?

595
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,860
Where's Beishuang?

596
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,500
She thought Tiandu was bored

597
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,710
and she wanted some fresh air.

598
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,180
Sanjiang?

599
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,580
The sixth volume is there, you know.

600
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,990
She's gone to fetch it.

601
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,990
Ridiculous.

602
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,070
Don't you know the desert is chaotic?

603
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,950
She'll easily be in danger.

604
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,100
I wanted to go.

605
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
But I can't find it.

606
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,390
Why did you lie to me?

607
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,230
Qingyun, it's an emergency.

608
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,190
I have to go get the six volume.

609
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,310
Sorry.

610
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,760
You bear huge responsibilities.

611
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,470
So, I didn't tell you in advance.

612
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,230
Please stay in Tiandu

613
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,190
and do not go out.

614
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,420
Don't worry about me.

615
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,380
By Beishuang.

616
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,820
You can't go.

617
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,340
She urged me repeatedly.

618
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,820
If something dangerous happens,

619
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,010
all our efforts will be wasted.

620
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,420
Get the horse ready!

621
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,340
(Sanjiang)

622
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,580
It's such a big place.

623
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,190
Really hard to find
the entrance to a cave.

624
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,580
I don't have too much time for you.

625
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,190
Why don't we slide in along quicksand?

626
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,550
The slightest lapse

627
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,950
may get us killed.

628
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,300
We have to find the real entrance.

629
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,910
(Sanjiang)

630
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,820
If you find it tiring,

631
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,420
you can go.

632
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,270
Leave me alone.

633
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,470
- Really?
- Yes.

634
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,950
Luckily, I haven't left.

635
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:00,540
(Sanjiang)

636
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,470
I found it.

637
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,660
Where is it?

638
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,660
Start from the stone tablet,

639
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,020
and go where the sun rises.

640
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,990
Within Genshan Mountain,

641
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,740
it's in the northeast.

642
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,990
You've learned something in Tiandu.

643
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,500
Madwoman.

644
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,830
Go along the tablet

645
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,100
toward the northeast

646
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,820
for 49 steps.

647
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,790
Try it.

648
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,180
One.

649
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,140
Two.

650
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,100
Three.

651
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,990
Report!

652
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,970
My Lord,

653
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,910
last night, we saw Huo Qingyun outside Tiandu

654
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,100
and he was riding fast southeast.

655
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,420
Leave us.

656
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,340
It's Sanjiang again.

657
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,740
They all head for Sanjiang.

658
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,950
There must be something fishy.

659
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,060
You send a vanguard

660
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,230
to Sanjiang with me.

661
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,860
Besides,

662
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,500
keep an eye on Huo Yanqi in Tiandu.

663
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,380
If he does anything unusual,

664
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,470
invade it without my permission.

665
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,940
Yes.

666
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,030
Let's go.

667
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,900
Go.

668
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,670
They fell in there.

669
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,350
They wouldn't be so careless.

670
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,340
